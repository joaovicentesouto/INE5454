I was so excited... until it started randomly crashing on me. I haven’t been counting, but I’m thinking it may have crashed about 30 times already in the last 10 hours. I’ll be sticking with it as long as I see improvements over time.;;;;;

Only gripe is because I have a large category tree (and I mean really big), I have to do a manual workaround but most sites won't have that issue. Highly recommended++++;4.0;0.0;2018-20-18;;2019-01-01
