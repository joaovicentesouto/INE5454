"1",281796108,"I was looking everywhere for the perfect app with which to take notes, keep records of things, or just to scribble down my thoughts or ideas, but I hadn‚Äôt had much luck before I found this app. Five minutes into using Evernote, I began to think this really might be it. I was so excited... until it started randomly crashing on me. I haven‚Äôt been counting, but I‚Äôm thinking it may have crashed about 30 times already in the last 10 hours. I‚Äôll be sticking with it as long as I see improvements over time."
"2",281796108,"I love this but the on thing i don‚Äôt like if i want to have reminder for every single task on my to do list and can‚Äôt and more different fonts on writing and i also i would like a feature to be able to look each individual note as well"
"3",281796108,"I don‚Äôt know why I have a badge unless I search the whole app. A Notification Center would be useful."
"4",281940292,"Crashed at times but overall wonderful!"

"6",281940292,"Great app. Reliable and dependable"
"7",282614216,"It‚Äôs cool"
"8",282614216,"Don't like Ebay too much waiting to deal with a dead beet seller, making the buyer wait for a long time to get results or money back"
"9",282614216,"Very good"
"10",282935706,"Very good and easy to use!"
"11",282935706,"I love reading the daily devotional plans"
"12",282935706,"Everyone should have this app on there phone. Daily usage makes everyday an amazing day!"
"13",283619399,"Love the game but, no new updates of any kind ie new tiles.  I guessing since this particular mahjong is not gouging our pockets therefore no new anything!"
"14",283619399,"Layout is too close to bottom screen, some pieces are hidden or difficult to see"
"15",283619399,"Have always loved this game because of the stunning graphics on tile and background choices. Have never seen a better mahjong game. Can upload photos to use as background and tile images can't be beat anywhere else. Had it for years and it's still the best!! Thank you üòÅ"
"16",283646709,"Ugh! I‚Äôve never had so much difficulty getting my own money! Never again!!"
"17",283646709,"I have been with PayPal since 2007, I buy and sell on EBay, and also use PayPal for personal and business use outside of PayPal. I sold an item on EBay but the buyer was having issues logging into PayPal through EBay so they sent me the money through PayPal Goods & Services. It‚Äôs been 2 days and my money is still being held, item has already shipped and I added the tracking number to the PayPal transaction. When I call I am told it is the automatic security protocol and it is not anything that can be corrected by a person. I asked how long the hold is, I was told ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre not told that, this way if a scammer calls trying to steal money, we can‚Äôt tell them when to try and transfer the money again. The hold is for as long as the security system wants it to be and that‚Äôs solely controlled by the computer system.‚Äù Seriously? A computer, who does not have a mortgage, a family, bills, or a life, is in sole control of when I can have my money. The sale was for over $1,000 and I even added money to the account at the recommendation of a PayPal associate to ‚Äútrick the system, since you‚Äôre adding money from the account you‚Äôre trying to transfer to so you can‚Äôt possibly be stealing.‚Äù Now that money is stuck in ‚Äúcomputer-controlled hold‚Äù also. Customer Service has been rude, unhelpful, and unknowledgeable. I can believe the lack of competency and that no one can do anything to get me my money. I mean they had me create a second account and try to transfer it there and then literally said ‚Äúwell, beats me!‚Äù when it did not work. Very frustrating, just lost a loyal long-time customer and her long-time customer parents, family, and friends."
"18",283646709,"Why $43.80 charge on a (US Domestic) transfer of $1500?  I WAS NOT NOTIFIED of this whatsoever and will not be using PayPal any longer if this is normal. Its exorbitant.   Doug White"
"19",284035177,"Maybe my Fav!! But, there aren‚Äôt many directions for ALL the things Pandora can do. So go ahead, and scour this app. I can‚Äôt tell you everything it does. As a matter of fact, every time I‚Äôm listening.   I start looking for new content. 10 *."
"20",284035177,"The best"
"21",284035177,"After trying to load pandora today I find out they no longer allow vpns. Looks like I‚Äôll be switching to a different streaming service as I‚Äôm not planning on dropping my vpn."
"22",284666222,"I actually like the app for its memory feature among other things that the standard iPhone calculator app doesn‚Äôt give you, but I‚Äôve come across this weird calculation where for example I‚Äôll type in ‚Äú80.32-20.25-60.07‚Äù when I equal it, it should say it equals 0, but instead I get ‚Äú-7.1054273576^-15‚Äù. And yes I understand this is basically 0 but I don‚Äôt understand why I gives me this unnecessary number instead of just 0. I‚Äôve tested this exact calculation on a number of other apps and even physical calculators as well as the standard iPhone app and they all give me 0. I thought maybe I accidentally changed a setting so I reset the app to its original settings but the same thing persists. Maybe there‚Äôs a fix for this and I‚Äôm just not getting it, but for now to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing in the settings that prevents this from happening."
"23",284666222,"A really well designed calculator - probably 2nd only to the HP Prime Pro app (although with some bugs, HP Prime is programmable, and has computer algebra system and graphing functionality).  Hence the suggestion to add graphing capabilities (e.g. with sliders as in Desmos) and CAS."
"24",284666222,"What more can I say?! ü§©"
"25",284736660,"It still looks a lot like the original video game, but the swipe controls are no longer functional.   FIX THE SWIPE CONTROLS!!!!!!"
"26",284736660,"This game is utterly useless since the upgrade went into effect. The brain dead imbeciles behind the alterations are apparently unaware of the concept of improvement, and have created an app that is vastly inferior to its previous iteration. The game was entertaining, now it is unplayable. Don't bother if you don't have it, delete if you do."
"27",284736660,"El control de juego en pantalla funciona con mucha dificultad  En cambio el juego de Ms. PAC-MAN lite yo lo descargue y el control de pantalla funciona muy bien  Necesito saber si me pueden corregir este problema o poder descargar otro juego igual que ese pero con el problema corregido Gracias  Atentamente Samuel Velazquez  7872093889"
"28",284791396,"Relaxing and very addicted. I love it  Keeps my brain active"
"29",284791396,"The selection bar at the bottom disappears too often!"
"30",284791396,"Love this app. Challenging, fun, great graphics. Definitely a top notch Solitaire game."
"31",284815117,"Once again, the app is not working. So annoying and frustrating. I bet the free one works, but it really annoys me that I have to resort to that version. Third time in a month, at least, where it has quit working.üò°üò°üëéüëé"
"32",284815117,"New version stinks.  Bring back the old one please!!!  I cannot turn off teacher even though u say I can. I hate it."
"33",284815117,"Not happy today. Had to download game because it wouldn‚Äôt load my game list. Now I have ads even though it is supposed to be the premium version."
"34",284815942,"The white is way too bright and I don‚Äôt really like having to use incognito all the time so if you could please just add dark mode compatibility that would be great!"
"35",284815942,"I‚Äôm really writing this review so Google could possibly see it and add a dark mode like iOS‚Äôs dark mode. And obviously the app is good, it‚Äôs Google."
"36",284815942,"What I mean by the title is that when you click on google you‚Äôll of course see other news besides the one on of what‚Äôs under What‚Äôs treading when you search something there. Of course I love Monsta x and interested in other topics beside Kpop you know, but there aren‚Äôt any news about anything, and when you click on google it only says google and nothing else. Could anyone pls tell me why this happens? But overall I give it 5 star because it have topics I want to read or know more about something."
"37",284847138,"The process is easy the explanation is understood easy to move from one service to another‚Äôs"
"38",284847138,"Directions for editing or deleting an account are useless. You‚Äôre only given the chance for that when you are adding an account. How do you delete obsolete accounts?"
"39",284847138,"We have been with B of A for more than 35 years and we still get the same excellent service. We wouldn‚Äôt go any where else.  Thanks very much for your  commitment to excellence."
"40",284862767,"This game has a scoring system tilted towards those who have patience to practice a game until they can land an unbelievable high score.  The high score times are so fast I don‚Äôt think I could tap cards fast enough to match them.    I would prefer the game started timing as soon as the cards are dealt so no practice was possible and players can only go by skill.  Keep a running 24 hour high score and increase the number of rankings so everyone who plays a game can see where they stand  - not just top 10 but top 1000 or 10000.    That would keep my addiction going."
"41",284862767,"I love this game, because much of it is old-school FreeCell, with the ability of playing both random games and numbered games. However, I have no intention of playing it daily. I have daily goals for Spanish, not for solitaire.   Please give us a way to totally turn daily goals off. I‚Äôll bump it back up to five stars if you do.  Update. The daily goals now has some use for me! However, is probably not the use you intend. Because it tells me that I have won my first game of the day, I now only play one game per day. Thank you! ;)"
"42",284862767,"Been playing it for years and it is the best of all the games available. Can‚Äôt do without it. Very well run so will have even the smallest problem and I love it. Ann"
"43",284876795,"As above"
"44",284876795,"Friendly and helpful staff.  Clean.  Beds comfortable.  Breakfast was adequate.  Some might be disappointed no Meat or hot eggs but there were boiled eggs.  Pancakes, waffles, cereal, toast, yogurt, and mini muffins.  You might want to be aware there is no elevator if have mobility issues.  My husband and I would stay there again."
"45",284876795,"I use this app every time I need to plan a trip! Thank you trip advisor!"
"46",284882215,"I recently was logged out of my account and when I tried to log back in they have a security measure of sending a code to the phone you made account with. I no longer own that phone or number so getting back into my account is impossible especially when the way to contact fb is not designed for every issue even though this is a common issue. There is no back door to correct the problem and emailing fb is useless and the help center is generic .."
"47",284882215,"Facebook me cierra cada vez que entro"
"48",284882215,"Great app but needs a new dark mode to go with messenger & iOS 13. Love the new features & speed"
"49",284910350,"We just finished a delightful and delicious meal at the Riverhouse and closed the place. 6 of us dined on 6 different entrees. Everyone more than satisfied. Unique fresh ingredients combined to create an amazing meal. Friendly server taking time to chat. We arrived later after visiting Munsen falls and were not rushed at all. Enjoy!! We did!!"
"50",284910350,"The reviews on businesses get removed because they believe that the reviews are fake or illegitimate. Yelp is not big in some towns so the people reviewing are probably real costumers writing honest reviews, but I guess they see them as fake profiles due to them not reviewing places much overtime or having friends added on yelp."
"51",284910350,"Excellent app"
"52",284993459,"Never opens Spotify when prompted. idk"

"56",285946052,"I really wish you guys didn‚Äôt do this. I would have paid an extra $100 for you to update iQuran HD so I can continue to use it. I have YEARS OF NOTES on that app. It is highly inconsiderate to your brothers and sisters who bought the app and used it for years not to update it. Now I have to migrate all my notes which will take weeks. Please have some understanding and update the app many of us already paid for. I know I will pay again. No problem."
"57",285946052,"I love this app, may Allah bless the developer of this app, and give him guidance to create the iPad version too. Aameen!"
"58",285994151,"Play of the game is excellent but the tutorials leave a lot to be desired."
"59",285994151,"This is a really fantastic sudoku app, and I use it pretty much daily. However, the developer no longer supports it.   One major issue that has cropped up is that it frequently serves puzzles that are one or two grades above what you choose. So choose ‚Äúmild‚Äù, and you‚Äôre dealing with an ‚Äúintricate‚Äù puzzle. It‚Äôs not consistent, though. And what‚Äôs worse is that there‚Äôs no indication this has happened until you find yourself stumped on what should be a puzzle that requires no advanced moves.   Beyond that, the ‚Äúbest‚Äù time displayed will change pretty constantly while you‚Äôre playing a puzzle, so you won‚Äôt know what your actual record is until you beat it. And just a complaint, the ‚Äúlessons‚Äù for advanced moves, etc., are incomprehensible. You could have just sat on a keyboard and created clearer instructions than what‚Äôs there."
"60",285994151,"I think this is the best Sudoku app available for cell phones.   I play it all the time and I have still not used all of the options."
"61",286058814,"Really really good app. Shouldn‚Äôt overlook this one"
"62",286058814,"Verizon customers used to be able to stream data free. Now it's changed and found out the hard way. Gotta change to Sprint after this. Smh"
"63",286058814,"Need to be able to Chromecast or stream what‚Äôs on the app to tv‚Äôs."
"64",286070473,"Top app!"

"67",286799607,"the best tuner on planet earth. accurate, fast, and, most importantly, *steady*. that‚Äôs what keeps me coming back to it after all these years. i‚Äôd pay a $10 a year subscription if i had to for this but i think it was only a buck or two when i bought it in 2011 or something."
"68",286799607,"I specifically bought this app for the ‚Äúunlock‚Äù feature that enabled the glissando pitch wheel that a friend showed me but the current version doesn‚Äôt have that feature. Huge drag and very disappointed."
"69",286799607,"The app no longer works. I have been using it for years and it did great. Very sad."
"70",286906691,"Jeff wittek sent me ig@akaserner"
"71",286906691,"The app is fine and cool. If you upgrade to premium you are wasting your money. I upgraded, it said 5.99 a month I think for six months. I got access to plans like keto things, which I wasn‚Äôt interested in the diet plans they have and more diagnostics for your fat,  calories, etc and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Then I tried to cancel my subscription and it charged me the full amount that would have been charged in six months."
"72",286906691,"I like this app a lot - it‚Äôs helped keep me on track with my diet and also seamlessly works with my Apple health apps. Excellent!"
"73",288113403,"It‚Äôs a great app, the only problem is it is a little too specific sometimes and doesn‚Äôt get the rough translation. I put nice in and it said it meant Bonita. But other than that, great app."
"74",288113403,"Love this app, it works pretty well some translations are not very accurate but in general it‚Äôs a really good appüëåüëå"
"75",288113403,"One of the best apps I‚Äôve ever used. Never let you down and always helped me out. Can‚Äôt say anything much better than that!! Bravo"
"76",288120394,"This application allows me to substitute a large lighting console for a coupe of iPads and has the flexibility for custom building or layouts.  Money well spent, this has been quality since first purchased 5 years ago."
"77",288120394,"The user can interface easily, change buttons and more.   Just download the programs from the website and use them along with this tool."
"78",288120394,"I would love it if this could be updated for iPhoneX, thank you!"
"79",288419283,"I had RadarScope for a while now and when I got a new phone I can‚Äôt remember what email address I used to log in with."
"80",288419283,"Wow, this update stinks.  Took away most of the features and lost resolution.  Are you making us pay $100 per year for what I had before?  Really?"
"81",288419283,"Great app, not for beginners as you need to have more than a basic knowledge of how to read and interpret radar on the map. Once you are able to understand you will discover how much this app has to offer. I have the base app without a subscription and that is good enough for me. Radar updates very quickly. Kansas City was nearly slammed with an EF4 tornado in May of this year (2019) and RadarScope displayed accurate velocity to pinpoint where the mile wide tornado was located. I was able to monitor the debris field as well using correlation coefficient. This app is strictly radar and is best used with other apps such as The Weather Channel for forecasts. This is my go to radar app. Fantastic. The only change I would make would be a more detailed map."
"82",288429040,"The app is a inflexible fire hose of ads, upsells, click-bait and lame ‚Äúclasses‚Äù which all slow down and interrupt your conversations. Yeah, I spoke to their mobile team, and they admitted it‚Äôs ad impressions and daily click interactions that matter most. You don‚Äôt use this app‚Äîit uses you. It makes me so sad. Premium adds more nags and spam.  Did someone in your network get tricked into uploading your private address so they can spam and sell it as a feature to advertisers? Were you that person?   Edit: your mobile team already looked closer and confessed"
"83",288429040,"The app is no longer functioning. Doesn‚Äôt refresh. Connections and messages pages won‚Äôt load either. iPhone 7Plus."
"84",288429040,"Hello-     Was impressed so far."
"85",289084315,"Best app I‚Äôve used to track my cycle and related symptoms"

"87",289084315,"Very useful and helpful!"
"88",289446241,"This is a great tool right now with the election tightening. Very fun and well written."
"89",289446241,"Complete waste of money and time."
"90",289446241,"Not accurate one sided"
"91",289523017,"This is by far the best blackjack game out there. It goes fast so you don‚Äôt have to sit there while the dealer slowly deals cards and wait for the next hand. You can get to it right away.  As far as rating this, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars BUT, the ads were incessantly obnoxious and completely annoying by constantly interrupting the game and then I‚Äôd forget where I was and lose my concentration. One of them even requires me to power off my phone to get rid of the music!! They said if you make a purchase, it will eliminate the adds.  So I made a purchase but the ads keep coming and coming. PLEASE STOP! Now I‚Äôm having to sit here on the phone with ITunes for hours waiting to get a refund. If you‚Äôre considering making a purchase through this app, DONT DO IT!  Not if you value your time that is."
"92",289523017,"Adequate but not great program.   Cons: ‚Äî Very slow to load, and has to reload every time you do something on phone like check messages.  ‚Äî no way to play with a set amount of money, like $500 and see how you do.  You can only play with your entire bank all at once.   ‚Äî cards are *very* small and difficult to see.   ‚Äî even after paying you gets tons of ads for other games.  Really irritating."
"93",289523017,"I like it very!!!! Much"
"94",289894882,"Last update took away family sharing. No I have to buy again. That is BS. App worked fine for years and still says it is compatible family sharing, but apparently not anymore."
"95",289894882,"There is so much provided in this app for such a ridiculously cheap price, you need to get this even if you only use it once. Which you won‚Äôt because it has such a wide variety of sounds, mixes, options, etc. the possibilities are truly limitless. One of the best bangs for your buck out there! I feel guilty not paying more."
"96",289894882,"I downloaded this app in a pinch for my toddler and baby to be able to sleep at a relative‚Äôs house and it works great! So many different sounds to choose from as well as asleep mode were you can see a large clock on your phone as if you have your plugged in alarm clock at home with you!  They really thought this one out! 5 stars for sure!! I‚Äôm 6 years into using it and still use the clock part every night! It‚Äôs a win win in my book!"
"97",290638154,"the instant you stop playing audio the app essentially closes itself. You have to go through the whole process of relaunching the app, finding what you were listening and searching for the point at which you stopped playing it. What a worthless junk app."

"99",290638154,"Thank you so much for fixing the app for voice over users i love the iHeartRadio app some of my favorite stations are power 105.1 New York and 102.5 wiog and 104.5 the cat just to name a couple i use this app every day and i have used the iHeartRadio app sense i was 10 years old and now i am 16 years old so i hope this app is here to stay for ever and ever"
"100",290986013,"I always hear such great things about this app, and it‚Äôs better than nothing, but it‚Äôs missing the most obvious feature: connecting to my UPS/Fedex/USPS/Amazon accounts and adding deliveries automatically. You can do this via email forwarding but that‚Äôs a pain to set up."
"101",290986013,"For rwviews"
"102",290986013,"I‚Äôve been using Deliveries for years. Junecloud has done a great job of building, maintaining, and improving this app across all platforms. I even use Junecloud Sync over iCloud because it‚Äôs so much faster and more consistent. Plus, who can resist arguably the best icon on the App Store?"

"106",292628469,"If you are looking for an app that can do some amazing things, this is it!  And once you get the hang of it, it is really easy and really quick to generate some great photoshop creations.  All you really need is your finger.  If you want to use Apple Pencil, you can really get down to the fine details, but you really do not need it to creat some great photos.  I‚Äôve been using this for a year or more and it is my go-to app for making my friends laugh with some awesome photoshops. Play around with the features and you‚Äôll begin to see how well done this app really is and how creative you can be."

"110",292738169,"I‚Äôm happy that Deezer is a default music source for Chromecast Home, which is primarily how I use it at home.  But in the car, it is almost useless: #1 My library artist list is not alphabetical.  Making it nearly impossible to find the artist you are looking for. #2 Album list is arbitrary and truncated.  Only about 25% of the albums for any particular artist shows up in CarPlay.    #3 There is no search function.  Also, when playing music at home there is no straightforward way to play just the songs of one artist in random order.  Instead, when requesting to play the songs of one artist, the default is for it to play artists Deezer deems as ‚Äúrelated‚Äù, in a Flow-like fashion."

"112",293118835,"That's the message I get after the most recent upgrade to iStellar. Tech Support at AstroArts gave the typical non-response:We're sorry that you got trouble.iStellar works any iPhone/iPod touch with iPhone OS 3.0 or later.

"114",293118835,"The ""Light Pollution"" setting is a brilliant feature for deciding what you could actually see in-town.  This is also one of the only apps I've seen that includes the Constellation Picture/Artwork so you can try to visualize what you actually see.  The app feels very light-weight and not prone to crashing from heavy use.I can go stargazing anytime and anyplace using this app! Search for a constellation, check the name of a star, or simply admire the sunset, twinkling stars, the Milky Way, etc. iStellar is no less functional than an actual star atlas/planetarium, and far more easy to control!"
"115",293523031,"I don‚Äôt like the new update‚Äî I liked having the Alarm accessible on the settings page without having to open up another window. Makes it difficult to change, which I do frequently.   Also smaller to read than before."

The company is paying a licensing fee to use the platform and I, the hourly wage employee, still have to pay to download the app?!!   It feels icky. Of course you‚Äôre going to charge the lowest tiered group to use your services because they have to use your services when you should just price your platform costs appropriately.   My disappointment was compounded because getting logged into the app is a NIGHTMARE. Horrible experience. I reset my password yesterday and still can‚Äôt get into the app and am resorting to my desktop.  I‚Äôve tried multiple times. If I‚Äôm paying to have this app, I‚Äôd expect it to be the best app on my phone and its just not.  Also, this is the only app on my phone I‚Äôve paid to download.    Once you can get logged in, the app is convenient and handy.  Easy to navigate and the layout makes sense. Not tons of lag or anything either.

"158",297244048,"What‚Äôs the Blazes happened to my review!?  (to ‚ÄúSifu_Char‚Äù: You CAN use VLCr on more than one iPhone, as long as all devices are connected to the same local area network. You can even use VLC Remote on two iPhones and one Android if you have it installed on there as well. The set up for VLC Remote only needs to be run once, after that you can connect as many devices to VLC as you have devices that have VLC remote installed on, and they don‚Äôt all have to be iPhones, The android app detects VLC after it has been set up just like the iPhone version. Hope that helps.)  I am afraid this app has fallen into disuse over the last couple of years, mostly due to many people moving to an easier platform to maintain: namely PLEX and PLEX pass.  But back when iPhones were a new deal, people mostly used one app and one app only to maintain their private video library‚Äôs: and that would be VLC aka VideoLAN. Video LAN as in Local Area Network, where we could network several home computers, share all of the media libraries, create multitudes of playlists and then have ongoing movie play back for days and days and years even.  And wouldn‚Äôt such an app require a remote control for us couch potato types? Enter VLC Remote.  Now we could have access to every of the cool features of VLC, change aspect ratio, language, alternate streams, we could play back DVDs, Blu-ray‚Äôs, MKV, FLV, AVI, WMV, MP4, MOV, and many other obscure formats that (OGG) all play back beautifully from one app.  I had the privilege of beta testing this app for a couple of years and a lot of the cool features in this app I remember discussing, in fact the way that it is now is the direct result of a core group of us who used to bounce ideas back-and-forth between us and the developer. Who is a great guy and he even put out a ‚ÄúVLC remote classic‚Äù for me and one other person and I still have that installed in one of my devices.   There was even a ‚Äúheadset mode‚Äú, an EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE with skull and cross bones warning, which works actually pretty well except that you have to manually sync up the audio on the hand devices to what‚Äôs playing on the TV, but it does give you a way of having a headset on from 20 feet away and you don‚Äôt have to have a 50 foot headphone cable (üòÇ). Is headset mode still there? YES! I was just using it.  These days most of the cool things that we were able to do with VLC we can now do with Plex media server, and so I feel badly that from my perspective this app has fallen along on the wayside to the point where my iOS 11 App Store automatically offloads the app on occasion ‚òπÔ∏è.  But whenever I do finally fire up VLC on my home network, I still use this app to manipulate it rather than having to get off my rear end, drag my butt over to the computer and mess with the interface there, in fact the combination of VLC Remote and Mobile Mouse gives me the ability to fire up VLC from Mobile Mouse üêÅ üê≠ and then I can move to VLC remote to access the app.  Lately the developer has been creating something called the ChillRemote which actually can give you a Remote for things like Netflix and Amazon and YouTube and it works pretty well, my only complaint with that is that it has a subscription feature to give you access to more features of the app and I loathe and despise subscription features. Mostly because that most developers that instigate a subscription use it to immediately bilk their former users out of a lot more money than the paid features usually cost in a one time payment. Rob does not do that though. He doesn‚Äôt ask very much for the subscription for ChillRemote, but I hate the concept of subscriptions, especially if it includes removal of advertisements which used to be a $.99 in app purchase for most apps.  Had to rewrite this whole review from scratch because I had a respring right in the middle of it üò°üò°‚òπÔ∏èüò°üò°üêÅ"
"159",297244048,"Purchased this app to play *.flac files and to use as a standin for the iPhone remote app from apple. When this app works, it is nice. I don‚Äôt think this app is ready for prime time. I used the free app for one day and figured I‚Äôd upgrade to be able to browse and add files. When I add files from the app, the playlist function fails and reverts back to the first song in the media player‚Äôs library (as listed). Essentially you cannot choose to start somewhere in the song listing and listen sequentially: the player automatically reverts to first song. Also, the volume function works only when not editing a playlist/song list. Once you load new songs and try to play those, volume control is lost. People say this app is better than Apple‚Äôs Remote (which has its quirks) but this makes VLC Remote not worth the $5 upgrade. Stay on the free version because it actually works as advertised. Very disappointed."

It just seems dumb, maybe remove that feature if you can‚Äôt figure out how to make the prices accurate to what it is in the store."

Really - how often do you need an auto loan compared with filtering for the checks you‚Äôve written, searching for a vendor or transaction quantity, or sorting based on transaction type?    The hamburger menu is an unruly bit of navigation hell. Please, don‚Äôt let every team add crap in there just cause they have a new thing to sell.   Oh, and for god‚Äôs sake fix the in-app alerts. If you are going to notify my that I have an in-app alert:communication - tell me where it is. Don‚Äôt make me guess if the alert is under Security or one of the accounts I have with you.

"220",301521403,"I used this app for many years I was so happy they I recommend to my friends because you make your own workout schedules and you see the difference and results it was amazing and you keep moving every day and motivated for next one but no, now is different and not everyone can pay a gym or app for that reason all people to have this app was happy before the new update."
"221",301521403,"Great app and I‚Äôve enjoyed using it for several years now. My main complaint is that I would love to use my iPad to watch workout classes instead of my iPhone. I realize iPads are not as common but the use case is very real. Please make the minimum effort to port your design to iPad dimensions and landscape mode."

"226",303058767,"I like this game a lot! I use to play it all the time and I just re downloaded it! The only thing I don't like is when I type in answers I want and then different answers pop up! Is this a recent glitch or something??"

"234",303337299,"Please bring it back for iOS!!!! I love this game!!!"
"235",303849934,"This is a fun game ! I love how its so easy to use and makes you sway as if you were really playing a drinking. Too notch"
"236",303849934,"What happened to having two shots per turn in single player mode? You can‚Äôt get balls back? And the bouncing shot does not take two cups away. I like the levels and all, but bring the rules back into the game!  Thanks"
"237",303849934,"Loved this game especially creative games and graphics. However, get booted several times a day, lose my chips, lose my games, lose my stats and support is of no help! Very frustrating and costly! Good luck!"

"241",304770340,"Well configured. Easy to navigate and the training courses are great. Wish my German was better to get a real grasp on the nuances. I live near Altenburg and still the German is tough. A great app."
"242",304770340,"Ich bin begeistert von der App und nutze sie seit mehreren Jahren regelm√§√üig. Die Updates bringen jedesmal Verbesserungen. Ich faende es klasse, wenn es noch mehr Uebungen in Daniels Strategie Trainer gaebe."
"243",304770340,"Great app and very addictive once you have the rules figured out. I wish there was more English so I could use the strategy trainer and analysis. The existing minimal English needs some work too (e.g. ""plenty points"" sounds funny) Thanks!"
"244",304871603,"Simple to use! Love it!! Make sure to zoom in for that fine detail! Works great!"
"245",304871603,"I had this app on my moms phone as a 2-5 year old before she got a new one, just found it again, and still love it!  yeah short review for it :l"
"246",304871603,"I love this app! It is easy to use and understand. My pictures come out awesome!  I highly recommend it! Woot!"
"247",304871622,"I played this since 2013 when it was first ported to Android. The updated controls make the game more comfortable to play on an iPad. It was fun revisiting this classic. This game is definitely not for small children though."
"248",304871622,"First of all, I want to say thank you so much for an amazing game. I‚Äôve been playing this game since 2013 but I went to upgrade the chainsaw but I didn‚Äôt receive my Solar Ray 3000 Gun. Every time I make a purchase after the level is complete I just receive more gas and no upgrade."
"249",304871622,"I just bought the application and I get the surprise that it is not compatible with iPhone xr, do an update please."
"250",304878510,"I love what you can do on Skype.  But going mobile is a hassle.  Very complicated to navigate where to paste the phone number (because accessing the contacts takes forever) and it takes a lot of patience to wait until the paste option is  shown so I can paste the phone number.   Once I paste the phone number I can make the call immediately."
"251",304878510,"The app us slow on a mobile and awkward on a laptop. Unexplained delays while entering numbers and instructions. The call quality is generally pretty good but getting there is not"
"252",304878510,"Skype works well around the world, but what used to be simple and a joy to use has become bloated and often annoying, on both mobile and desktop."

"254",305343404,"Lift the adult content ban and everything will be cool. Let the ban stand and this app will continue to be trash. That simple."
"255",305343404,"I got nuked without being told what was wrong, and what I could potentially change. They also delete any sideblogs you have? All my friends are dead and there are still pedophiles. 2.2/10"
"256",305557780,"This ap used to work great, now both both face frames show on each opened pic, (confirmed does this even if only one person in each photo so AE isnt recognizing two faces)  No longer works, even though I paid for the full version, and confirmed up to date."
"257",305557780,"Where is the iphone x support??? So hard to use the app Since its not fit to screen with the iphone x screen. Plus u guys need to update the app!"
"258",305557780,"I found this app useful for a variety of applications along with swapping faces.  It can remove imperfections accidentally caught on photographs, uncomplimentary blemishes on faces, a misaligned ear or hairline, and even remove a bright light and other background distractions from an otherwise appealing photograph.  It is one of my favorite apps.  Serves as a mini Photoshop."
"259",305939712,"It says nothing about this on the App Store but unless you pay it‚Äôs useless. People like me or even message me but I can‚Äôt even see who has liked me or messaged me unless I have premium. I‚Äôm not paying for a dating app when it‚Äôs not gonna introduce me to people who aren‚Äôt already on Grindr, Tinder, etc. If you don‚Äôt want to spend $10+ a month then don‚Äôt even bother"
"260",305939712,"If you‚Äôre between the ages of 21-30 , honestly don‚Äôt waste your money. 90% of the people on here are in their 40s or older."
"261",305939712,"Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt fault the app as the dating pool is typically trash anyway.  Maybe I‚Äôm just giving my review on dating. But this app is horrible. You HAVE to pay in order to see ANY messages.  You can‚Äôt match unless you pay. And the one time rate us so insanely expensive that you gravitate towards the 3 month service for a little less than double the price if the one month.  While I can‚Äôt hold match responsible for the plethora of unattractive men and complete creeps, maybe they draw that type in.  I, out if boredom and loneliness, learned a $75 lesson today. Don‚Äôt match.com. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"262",306169895,"My daughter absolutely loves this app and has worked greatly with her hand-eye coordination. The only problem we have is when she drags a letter or figure from the box in the top right hand corner of the screen, my iPhone notification screen swipes up and covers the game up. Its very frustrating to her. She would play it more if this issue was fixed somehow."
"263",306169895,"I do not usually leave reviews but I wanted to here. I got the free version for my son a few years ago. Within a few weeks we bought the full version. He loves it to this day and still plays it when he can. It is wonderful to keep a busy five year old engaged."
"264",306169895,"My son loves playing this game. Especially the interactive puzzles. Love that there are different ones and they have added more."
"265",306257910,"It's a great app and the sync for family sharing works very well. I would like to suggest to add an option to type and auto-suggest already entered payee names. Since we travel a lot, our list of payees is very long. Not being able to type and auto suggest the existing payee makes it very time consuming to keep scrolling through the list."
"266",306257910,"I‚Äôve been using this app for about 3 years now and I‚Äôm very happy with how it‚Äôs allowed me to manually track m expenses and balance my bank account month to month.  Some improvements I would like to see would be some tweaks in the ‚Äútransfer‚Äù areas. First of all, it‚Äôd be nice to have a little more confirmation of a completed transfer. Like maybe a next screen that shows the completed transfer. Just something with a little more visual feedback so mistakes aren‚Äôt made. Also with this, I‚Äôd love the option to include transfers as a budgeted expense. For example it‚Äôd be nice to add a transfer into the budget in order to track that as an ‚Äúexpense‚Äù and have it all together. But maybe this could be optional unlike a typical expense. This would help a lot with people like me that want to have a zero-based budget where we budget out 100% of our expenses including savings.  I would also love the addition of some realt-time feedback in the ""split categories"" menu so that I can see (after putting the first category and amount) how much is remaining from the original dollar amount so that I don't have to do math in my head and memorize the numbers!"
"267",306257910,"This is the best app for doing a manual budget. Anytime I try a different app, I always come back to this one.  You can make a simple budget or a complex budget with this app.  I like the sync feature.   Please bring iCloud sync support."
"268",306621789,"Keep up the good work."
"269",306621789,"Huffington post is missing the boat on this apps functionality. The ability to follow certain comment threads or even quickly find yours is not really an option."
"270",306621789,"Constantly slipping left and right when i am just trying to scroll down. I am on an iphone 8 with 256g and app often locks up. Disappointed a once great app has become a bloated, slow piece of annoyance-ware. I miss the slim, trim app that used to just work."
"271",306628397,"Really fun game except when it‚Äôs depressing like sex crimes"
"272",306628397,"THANK YOU for this game!!!! So cute so fun. Have never heard some of these phrases  lol"

"274",306937053,"needs a wraparound setting"
"275",306937053,"I‚Äôve had this App on my devices for years and I always come back to it. IMO, it‚Äôs the best minesweeper for iOS because it‚Äôs so down to earth and - in the best sense - simple. I will amend my review to five stars as soon as the developers manage to fix that pesky bug that sometimes delays the posting of a flag, especially and mostly on the right side of the largest playing field."
"276",306937053,"Keeps bugging me for a review after every match. Well, here it is."
"277",307132353,"Thank for making this game. Played it years ago and still do so today. Deleting all the history and starting again.  I feel like this game and ranch rush are the best 2 games i‚Äôve played. I would love more games like these please. This would be cool to play under the new ios. If that doesn‚Äôt happen , its cool. I love this one.  Thank you Games Cafe!"

"281",307184892,"Is there a way I can have an add-free version?"
"282",307184892,"Not mentioned until you try to stream it live. I get CBS just fine with an antenna."
"283",307354030,"I hate this game"
"284",307354030,"I have had so much fun with this app! It‚Äôs sooooo funny! Simple to use and very fun. No problems as far as I‚Äôve had it. I definitely recommend this app if you are looking to have a good laugh with friends and family."
"285",307354030,"Amazing app"
"286",307386350,"First off, you have to be connected to the same network as your box to even be able to watch something on your phone which totally defeats the purpose. Secondly, even when I am at home I can never get the app to function properly to watch on phone when someone is watching something else."
"287",307386350,"I don‚Äôt have total access plz fix it. I have been missing games for about two years now."
"288",307386350,"best app"
"289",307569751,"Challenging, fun, exhilarating at times     and exercises the mind."
"290",307569751,"I had to stop playing Words With Friends because I was an addict. Now I am in danger of becoming a Crossword addict. So I have to limit myself to one new mini, one archived mini, one new daily and one archived one per day. Otherwise...  I am slowly getting the hang of the crazy clues that make you think around two or three corners. Good for the gray cells!"
"291",307569751,"I often play old Sunday puzzles over the course of a week or 2 for brief intervals in the evenings. I used to be able to view my puzzle history and resume the last puzzles I was playing easily, but I don‚Äôt see that option anymore. I also like to do easier puzzles in between when I work on a Sunday one. I need to be able to get back to the puzzles I was working on without having to to memorize the exact month and week of the one I had been doing. This is going to make the way I like to use the app very inconvenient :("
"292",307727765,"I love this game but the ads you‚Äôve been running today are completely inappropriate. Why am I receiving ads saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being deported by U.S immigration‚Äù and then some other ad showing sperm with the title ‚ÄúHow long are you going to live?‚Äù This is a child‚Äôs video game. You need to be more mindful of the ads you guys run."

"298",307764057,"NOTE: If you have an Apple TV, NicoNico does have a stripped down an app for it, but you need to grab it through iTunes Japan. Ironically, it‚Äôs easier to wrestle with than the unfriendly iPhone app.  I've been trying for years to access my NicoNico account to view the live concerts I joined their premium service for, across both Kindle Fire (semi-Android/proprietary OS) and my iPhone, to no avail. Crash after crash the moment I launched content. That's finally fixed. I watched my first concert marathon broadcast on this app this morning. Excellent. Now only if they made finding the live broadcasts schedule and bookmarking them easier on mobile (notoriously difficult). And corrected the site and app international event time/date glitches (been happening since 2012). And optionally offered the form notices that users see often in English for non-fluent viewers out there.   Well, at least the app finally works."

"300",307764057,"Nico Nico Douga is a really fun app to use to watch videos and everything else. Although in the description about this app, it said that there were other languages to choose from within the app. I could not find that option! I can get around some Hiragana and Katakana....but I have no idea what everything else says otherwise.   Please fix this issue if possible, if English or any other language is FOR SURE NOT AVAILABLE, then I would highly suggest to remove the ‚Äúother languages included‚Äù from the description so that other customers will not have this confusion. Thank you so much!"

"307",308339980,"I like this game on how you can mess around with  ragdolls . But it dose need more to do"
"308",308339980,"This game is great and love the physics but there has to be more stuff like to be able to shoot a character with a gun or there has to be more characters than just 4. Like add a soldier or police to make the game more fun"
"309",308339980,"I used to like the game however got bored of it in like 3 days because there was not much to it,no obstacles or weapons or any thing besides throwing around a rag doll,u had a great thing going but then u just gave up on this project!!!!! The game has so much potential but u just left the drawing thinking that everything was fine in the game.over all great game but u need to add more things and I‚Äôm speaking for almost everyone who wrote a review on this app at allüòë"

"312",308368164,"Proloquo2 is my son‚Äôs voice. I am so grateful he has words through this app on his device! He can tell me how he is feeling, whether he wants to be by himself or have me near, he can order his own food, ask for a break or the bathroom, and unlike the PECs we used to use, we can add more words on the spot as needed or desired. The communication I have with my child through Proloquo2 is priceless!"

"320",309025938,"Love this app. Watched the featured pairings every morning, until coverage aired, through my Apple TV, via my phone. Interactive features were really nice as well. Sorry to hear others rating this app had such poor/bad experiences. No issues at all with mine."
"321",309025938,"I found myself jumping back to this app even near the tournament end due to the flexibility of watching particular holes or a featured group with no commercials. CBS seems to have abandoned the ‚Äúlimited commercial interruptions‚Äù we have come to enjoy in previous years. Yes it lacks the polish of the broadcast production and gave it 4 stars due to audio problems like echoing. However, it was wonderful to see it on the big TV screen through my Apple TV. I wish they would do it for all majors but am happy it is available for my favorite."

"331",309527804,"I used to enjoy this game on the iPod, and just tried this newer version. The game play doesn‚Äôt work as described in the tips so you fail, repeatedly.  Example 1: ‚Äúcapture one invader at a time and build up your number of prisoners‚Äù. No, the game only lets you put one invader in the prison until it goes away. Example 2: ‚Äúdouble tap the tent to train a prisoner to be an archer‚Äù. No, the game doesn‚Äôt seem to recognize double taps. Example 3: ‚Äúslam invaders into catapults to destroy them‚Äù. While you can slam invaders to the ground this has no effect on machines."

"343",310636441,"I absolutely love this app, it is probably one of the most used apps on my phone during the school year. I love the notifications it sends and how I can put all my yearly assignments in one place. I feel like it helps to keep me organized by having all my classes and due dates in one place.  But some things that I don‚Äôt like about this app are the fact that you cant mark an assignment as complete, you either have to delete that assignment or it gets marked as ‚ÄòOverdue‚Äô. Another thing I don‚Äôt like is the fact that your schedule on the app doesn‚Äôt give you an option to connect to a Google calendar only your Calendar Events can connect to your IOS calendar without even asking."
"344",310636441,"I have been using this app for 8 years and it always had my back. Every teacher, assignment, and class imputes and used for 13 distinct semesters. You can‚Äôt trust your brain to remember every class time but iStudiez sending me notifications and syncing with my calendars made it easy.  Every assignment or test inputed on my phone at the end of class easily synced to all my devices. I would pull up the app on my computer to ensure I never forgot an assignment. This only happened maybe 7 times total in 8 years because of this app.  I could easily contact teachers by inputting their email at the start of the semester too. My biggest fear was the app would stop being updated but the team at iStudiez instead always strived to add more features and make the app better. They continue to do so and I am now sad to leave the app because I have officially graduated college.   This is my first review ever. I‚Äôm writing it because I want to thank the whole team from the bottom of my heart. You all got me through school just as much as my teachers, friends, and family. Keep changing students lives for the better.  Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I noticed that they are now promoting the houses they buy first, charge way higher rates for commission and below market prices when they purchase the home. I am done with you Zillow."
"347",310738695,"There was a time when Zillow attempted to value homes independently but now all you do is copy the price of whatever a property is listed for or has sold for; plus or minus $5-10.

The new button click sounds are so loud that I had to turn the music up to 90% and the button sounds down to like 10% in the mixer.   One thing I have wanted for a long time is a way to type search and select specific weapons in the target practice mode. Scrolling through 300 weapons manually every time you want to test out a specific scenario with a weapon before you make the actual shot during an online game is cumbersome to say the least.   An update/option to have 5 or more moves back or forward would be great and more fun.   Been playing for 16 years. Thanks for the fun game! Keep it up!"

Although I really enjoy it there are a couple of suggestions that I would like you to read... when you unlocked extra levels for the holidays I completed them but the n when the holiday was over they disappeared! It was just really disappointing. Another thing is that sometimes at the beginning of the game it won‚Äôt let me click on the 100 apples sign even when I really need it!

There isn‚Äôt a step by step guide of how to play. Searching through the app I found a list of rules but it‚Äôs more like a whole written manual than a step by step guide. I feel like the description is misleading. It doesn‚Äôt actually teach you how to play.

"391",315021242,"7/7/19- I‚Äôve had this game for a long time and it never disappoints. The dev‚Äôs have done a great job of keeping it zen, beautiful, running smoothly, and stocked with puzzles. And they haven‚Äôt given in to the current ugly AppStore trend of greedy and manipulative cash grabs.  Hats off to you guys, job well done. üé©üé©üé©"
"392",315021242,"Played in the beginning. Some upgrade found me without. Years later I remembered and decided to download again. Still a great game but the developer has sold out to the ad world and you now suffer ads with tiny ‚ÄòX‚Äôs‚Äô that have you opening a site when you try to close. Just another ‚Äúgive me money and screw the customer‚Äù app.   Deleted!"
"393",315021242,"Simple idea, easy to learn, yet hard to master. And the best thing is that the developers have been keeping up the game throughout all the iOS updates.

"394",316025912,"The game is awesome. Easily the best version of Sonic 1 ever. My only real gripe is that I bought the game back when is was still pay to play and I'm forced to deal with the ads that were put in place when the game became free.

"395",316025912,"I love having this game so readily available on my iPad, but having additional control options, like having the Smart Keyboard, or any keyboard controls for the game would make it perfect."
"396",316025912,"This would be a really great game IF when you paid the $2 to remove the ads the ads actually left. Sonic 2 doesn‚Äôt seem to have the same issue, but I‚Äôll be requesting a refund for this one."
"397",316227296,"It is already a great game! One thing that would make it better would be a slo motion after all plays with a screen tap, not just the strikes. Set up so you could adjust it in the settings menu. Turn on and off whatever features you wanted."
"398",316227296,"Really a great game, keeps stats, play cards, what more can want?"
"399",316227296,"I‚Äôve had this game for years, on multiple iPhone and iPad generations, and I appreciate the developer‚Äôs commitment to keeping the game alive through numerous iOS updates. Still looks good and feels responsive. Still great fun for a quick game or extended play."

"414",318639200,"This is the game if you want to simply throw projectiles at block castles. The different types of projectiles and blocks are easy to figure out, so it comes down to strategy and aim rather than pay-to-play special items with weird effects.

Are you kidding me??  This is totally maddening.  Its like watching game 7 of the NBA finals with the score tied and a minute left then ending coverage.

Poor updates on the app told me there were as many as three groups on the same hole and was often several holes behind. Didn‚Äôt even have the correct players playing together more than once on Wednesday. I know that there were no official groups or times for the practice rounds but you think someone on the first and tenth tees could have updated the groups. With groups teeing off both nines on Friday this could have been invaluable to fans had it been correct and updated.."

Great to track health and be able to provide care providers accurate information that doesn‚Äôt require crumpled bits of paper.

And it is still being updated which is a big bonus in my book. Thanks."
"501",326574411,"Timeline is confusing because it tracks activities (sleep, feeding) using actual hours as they are spread over the day‚Äôs. For example, a part of the night sleep is often shown on one day‚Äôs events (eg 8pm - 12am) and another part (12am - 6am) on the next day‚Äôs events. Although accurate, this is not super helpful because I cannot clearly see how much my child slept, or ate, or how often they got up, on any given night.  Also, when entering data, certain data entered resets itself when you try to adjust another data set. For example, if I don‚Äôt want to time bottle feeds but just want to enter oz, by the time I‚Äôm done adjusting all, the begin time resets back to current time, forcing me to reenter the begin time.

"518",327455869,"I have belatedly updated my USOpen.org 2019 app and found it (as of 9/7/2019) to be improved but still far from impressive in its design or its journalism.  Previously, I could not find match statistics that worked, or live radio. Both are fine now.   A new tab at the bottom of the screen leads to ‚ÄúPlayers.‚Äù Thank you. But why does it have only individual statistics, not individual bios? If you can‚Äôt write them, please at least link to Wikipedia.  Match previews are written cheerfully but inelegantly. They include outright typos like ‚ÄúRoger‚Äù Cup for ‚ÄúRogers‚Äù and inexcusable coding in the middle of sentences, as in the following two paragraphs:  Serena: ""I've felt more prepared this tournament...?external=true I just feel like I've actually had time to train.""  Patrick Mouratoglou: ""...I?external=true think her movement now is better than I have ever seen since she became a mother.""  Apparently, these embarrassments were caused by ellipses, which should not be used anyway in feature interviews though they may be needed when quoting legal documents. The assumption is, readers understand that all quotes from oral interviews are excerpted. We KNOW Patrick said other things before (and after) this quote!  Slide shows of still photos are excellent technically and artistically but next to worthless journalistically because they lack captions describing the significance, if any, of the moment shown. Instead, a boilerplate caption is used on almost every caption: ‚ÄúSo-and-so in action against so-and-so in the nth round,‚Äù etc. Your images obviously are selected for their design value, not their significance, which is nice, but we‚Äôve all seen thousands and thousands of beautiful tennis stills. Video clips with interpretation on the soundtrack would be far more interesting, even for users who don‚Äôt play tennis.  Like the post-match stories, the photos emphasize the positive, becoming more like PR than journalism. That means this app cannot become a fan‚Äôs go-to place for all things US Open. Moreover, the mainstream media complete their postgame reports many minutes earlier than this app.   Maybe just give up on the journalism and become more like the website of a state legislature: schedules, outcomes and repositories of history. In addition, US Open could curate and amalgamate others‚Äô journalism, as Apple News does."
"519",327455869,"Need to copy Wimbledon app for efficiency. With Wimbledon app the scores come slightly before play is finished on TV. My TV is older so I rely on apps to see the scores.

I have a financial file that is stored ‚Äúin the app in the ipad folder‚Äù and i dont want to lose it. Is there anyway to access this file using another app and then making a copy of the file?  I had a similar problem several months ago and the problem was related to DropBox, so i saved the file on my ipad.

"546",329981776,"Absolutely the best sudoku game on the internet. Straight to the point without any distracting graphics or unnecessary animations. Completely customizable so you can set the level of hints to your own liking. The puzzles range from super easy to diabolically difficult. The numbers are nice and big and the notes make the harder games easier to solve. I love sudoku and this app is just what I need to keep me sharp, challenged and entertained. The ad-free version is definitely worth all five stars."

Pairing was iffy...Every time iPhone went to sleep or a pop-up would appear, iPad lost connection. Preview on iPad was pixelated, and the proportions were skewed.

"602",334264405,"Every time I start the app is closes"
"603",334264405,"Every time I turn the app on it gives me the same words that were said when I closed the app previously.  I‚Äôll buy the real thing.  I know my parents are in my house and I just want to know why."
"604",334989259,"An extremely powerful app!"
"605",334989259,"I bought the app for 5$, I paid using my hard earned money and I expected to have everything after the recent update, they took features away and put them in their service. This should be pulled from the store."
"606",334989259,"Purchased the app forever ago. Developers removed the features I paid for and transitioned to a subscription model. I used to use this app every day for step by step solutions for calc until they removed the features I PAID FOR."
"607",335029050,"When trying to register for online play, I‚Äôm getting an error saying the email is already associated with an account. I‚Äôve tried four different emails that I know have never been used and still getting error. This is my first time using the app ever so I know I don‚Äôt have any accounts. Frustrated."
"608",335029050,"Good game if you play with other humans.  Representative of the real article. Only drawbacks are:  1) Symbols are a bit hard to see/interpret on a smaller screen (phone) but not an issue on a tablet.   *2) The rampant use of ‚Äúcomputer cheating‚Äù if you are playing solo. Anytime you‚Äôre a victory point ahead of the others, numerous 7s will be rolled, Knight cards will be played, and no one will trade cards with you. The robber never moves anywhere but your spaces regardless of other considerations. Absurdity isn‚Äôt even close to an accurate word."
"609",335029050,"Overall, this is a good rendition of the board game Catan. The board game rules are adhered to (except that the computer decides without rolling the dice who puts down their first settlement), and the dice rolls are mostly fair and realistic (though in one game, the robber was rolled about a third of the time and no 8s were ever rolled). I‚Äôve heard from other reviews that the dice tries to help the AI when you‚Äôre close to winning, and this is probably true to some extent, but I was still able to win a lot of the time. It‚Äôs also great how the different characters in the game have their own personalities and levels of skill, so you‚Äôre not playing against the same AI each time.   There is a problem with the distribution of development cards in the game. Once, I was in the lead by 3 points and one of the AIs somehow won by acquiring 5 victory-point cards in a row, even though there are supposed to be 5 one-victory-point cards in the game set and 25 development cards in total. It‚Äôs also very difficult to see what the AIs are trading, whether with each other or the bank. In general, the AIs seem to rely more on development cards than most real-life Catan players and often don‚Äôt build settlements when they could very likely be able to do so.  Otherwise, I would recommend buying this app if you rarely get to play the physical Catan board game."
"610",335047649,"This app simply doesn‚Äôt function as it should. All I need it to do is add contacts to my address book. However, it only recognizes a small portion of the text and the rest is gibberish.   I want my .99 back!"

"616",335545504,"Just recently bought Six Ages and have been playing it for the last few days. Not sure if that has anything to do with the problem I‚Äôm experiencing but I‚Äôve picked King of Dragon Pass back up and it will not let me view tribes in my relations screen or access it via the map screen. When I do try to view tribes it crashes the whole game and takes me back to my phones home screen. I‚Äôm at loss... it never did this before. Could it be an iOS update that messed it up? Please get back to me concerning this as I would appreciate it, immensely. Really enjoyed playing KoDP.

"619",335709058,"My favorite part of the app is the style stats, especially the cost per wear stat. It‚Äôs also great to see what you wear most and least. I love the app for what it is.   However, the app needs CLOUD backup. The last time I got a new phone I lost everything and I was not able to restore a backup saved on my laptop. While I also wish I could go from phone to ipad via wifi (I gave up on the wifi accept, too cumbersome), I‚Äôd settle for a decent cloud backup. I‚Äôm still recreating pics from round one, and of course the stats too.   UPDATE: To be clear, I did set up my new phone from the iCloud backup. I did not set up as a new phone. Still lost all of the photos which is why I then tried to restore a backup on my computer. Neither worked to retrieve my photos.  And I had been regularly backing the old phone up to iCloud. So your response did not address my issue. There are multiple reviewers who appear to have had the same issue recently.   On the positive side I recently created looks for a business trip and then created a packing list from the looks. This works brilliantly."
"620",335709058,"Please refund my account. This app is crap."
"621",335709058,"I almost gave up, on this app when I began trying to photograph my clothes. However, now, I am using the app ‚ÄúPaper‚Äù by WeTransfer, and I can‚Äôt get enough of it! So much fun! I feel so girlie! (I am 73 years old) I use my iPencil to make some simple outlines in Paper, like, of T shirts, then color them in, save the image to photos, and it imports into Stylebook, no problem, nd doesn‚Äôt need the tedious erasing of the outline, etc.  the app really helps me find outfits right within my closet I hadn‚Äôt thought of before. I feel ‚Äòclothes rich.‚Äô The only downside is that it‚Äôs a very tempting procrastination tool...and when I wake in the middle of the night, I want to draw more clothes andd add them to Stylebook. It would be a great program for children who are ill and need to stay in bed. Creative! Next to YNAB, it is my favorite app....along with Paper."

And now I see that it‚Äôs updated with Bethesda‚Äôs new software... the controls are HORRENDOUS AND MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE! You cannot continuously fire, which means you have to double tap for every bullet of the chaingun, and you cannot use the plasma gun, and for anyone who has never played Doom before, that‚Äôs not me using that figuratively, you actually CANNOT use the plasma gun. I updated my phone and had to install this new version after deleting the old one a few months ago. I feel so stupid I deleted that version. I paid money for that old version and now I can‚Äôt play it, I no longer have access to Doom.

I received an email confirmation of my membership cancellation on 2/11/2019. However, I have recently been receiving more and more aggressive emails from them with statements like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already sent you three emails reminding you that the fee for your Runtastic Premium Membership is outstanding. Did you happen to see those? As you can see from the Runtastic Terms & Conditions, which you accepted, the Runtastic Premium Membership is renewed automatically.‚Äù  I cancelled my membership with them seven months ago and have an email confirmation of it from them. Why they continue to harass me for a membership payment is beyond me.  I loved their app and would give it a five star review, but getting harassed with threats for membership payments when I had clearly cancelled it lowers it to a one star review. Their emails make me think they are low on cash and are desperate to get money to keep the company afloat. We‚Äôll see if they‚Äôre still around in a couple months."

"663",337462979,"4 thumbs UP!  (2 from me, 2 from the kid)  Our 3.5-year-old will easily sit half an hour playing this game (he would keep going if I'd let him).  I like its simplicity without extra fluff.  All the  setup options are very intuitive and straight forward too.  Our son kept picking letters out of order, and it was bugging the OCD in me.  So I went to settings, and there it was, the ""left to right"" option.  Tada!  We've only played the shapes category so far, but I like the variety that goes beyond the regular, way too common geometric shapes.   Having the Japanese option was actually the determining factor for us, and I would think any parents who are raising their children in one of the optional languages would really appreciate the multi-lingual function.   We had the free version for a long time but now that our son is really picking up on letters and sounds, we decided to get the full version even though I knew the app was old with no updates of late. But lo and behold, I was pleased to see that it was just updated a month ago! Yay!   The animation and the drawings are very basic, which can be improved, I suppose. I do however like the bold (again, simple in a good way) colors."

"706",341691394,"I have been using Refills for a month or so, and it has become my favorite calendar app. 5 stars! I have a couple of small suggestions: Move the settings option for the icon badge number out of ‚ÄúTasks View Settings‚Äù to its own category, and include an option for the current date as a badge icon. The other suggestion would be to add a small, always visible icon to jump to the current date. Unless there‚Äôs a trick I don‚Äôt know about, the current process is to tap to display the share icon, tap the share icon, then tap a third time to jump to the current date. If adding the icon isn‚Äôt feasible, adding ‚ÄúJump to Current Date‚Äù to the top of the ‚ÄúMore‚Äù menu might be an option. Thanks for a great app!"

"714",342115564,"When I first downloaded Hipstamatic way back in prehistoric times, nothing else like it existed. I would even make the argument that this is still true.  When Instagram showed up on the App Store I thought, seriously? Who would want to take photos you can only share with other people with fewer options and ridiculously inferior quality? Turns out. I guessed the same thing with YouTube when it launched so hey, if you ever wanted to invest in a startup just don‚Äôt take my word for it.  Anyway. Hipstamatic hasn‚Äôt changed much over the years, and that has been one of its greatest assets. The boutique experience it provides (hipster, say) is seriously worth experiencing. It was my personal introduction to lomography, which eventually lead me to taking, developing, and printing my own physical photos.  I feel like this review is long overdue, especially because the quality and support is so consistent to this day. If you‚Äôre at all on the fence, just give it a shot. If you‚Äôre sick of only curating your life for social media, or even if you do want vastly superior shots for it, Hipstamatic has unparalleled freedom and is the way to go."

Simply use the search box to search by artist or song title.  HOW TO SING ANY/ALL SONGS FOR FREE:  If you want to sing any song for free, just type it into the search box and scroll through the results til you find one without the VIP tag.

I just really feel like it‚Äôs going a bit too far and I hope it doesn‚Äôt go any further at this point. If the extra revenue is necessary, all I can say is that sometimes more isn‚Äôt necessarily better, sometimes it‚Äôs just more in my opinion.  IMDB is still my go-to resource on the internet for accurate film entertainment information any time I need it. I‚Äôve been using it for almost twenty years I think? There‚Äôs still no better site on the web for reliable film and television data and the application reflects that same reliability in my opinion.

Apparently the app allows to change ‚Äúseats‚Äù to a different train,  but not actual trains! So we ended up with seats on the earlier train and no actual train ticket.  The app needs to be a lot more clear about such distinctions. The conductor could do nothing to help except sell us second set of tickets with no seats. Another problem - why can‚Äôt the app show us where free seats are so we can reserve seats. Even conductor‚Äôs app could not show free seats so we and luggage were tossed from seat to seat for the next three hours."

"737",343889987,"In its current form the Oui SNFC app contains a fatal bug that permanently disables all access to Apple Wallet. Any attempt to add a trip to Apple Wallet permanently freezes all access to your Apple Wallet. Additionally, if you attempt to select ‚ÄúWallet & Apple Pay‚Äù within the iOS Settings app you will permanently disable all access to settings within the operating system as a whole. The issue is entirely reproducible and critical with respect to both the app and the APIs it uses. It also suggests a security issue in iOS itself since no single app should cause a permanent OS instability. Neither restarting and closing this app nor restarting the Settings app will restore access to Wallet and the operating system becomes permanently compromised simply by attempting to add a trip to Wallet in the OUI.sncf app."

Discounts are granted based off estimated AGI at the start of the year, if your AGI ends up higher at the end of the year, you have to pay back the discount at tax time. And If you are over the amount to qualify, you pay it ALL back and end up owning THOUSANDS of dollars on your tax return. That single aspect can swing your tax refund in a huge way, and it‚Äôs not included in this app as far as I can tell.   Beyond that, it was easy to use and the interface was pleasant.

My app has cellular turned off for this app. The episodes appear to have downloaded and if I listen to a downloaded podcast while still in WiFi range, they work fine. If I am out of WiFi range when I launch a podcast that is listed as downloaded, the content screen goes blank and the podcast will not play.

"800",351727428,"We love the app.  It makes it easy to pay orvrequest money from family members."
"801",351727428,"It‚Äôs annoying to ask for the 1st and 2nd withdrawal from bank account. My phone only back tracks to one year therefore that withdrawal was made years ago and I had to log into a computer to back track to that transaction. I understand it‚Äôs for my card safety but there should be an option to provide other verification."
"802",351939099,"If you are a fan of text-based RPGs, this would be a great game for you. It could easily become a more text-based game, but the images and artwork make it more engaging and interesting.   There is an easy-to-learn, simple UI and the game progression is satisfying. There are things that could be refined/cleaned up or expanded on as with any game, but it is definitely worth a buy.   I‚Äôd be thrilled to see more content (not that there isn‚Äôt enough already for a game like this) or a similar game (sequel?).  „Å®„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Åß„Åô„Çà„ÄÇÊØéÊó•„Åì„Çå„Çí„Åó„Åæ„Åó„ÅüÔºÅ"
"803",351939099,"Played the lite version And seems promising. But buying the full version on iPad now crashes iCloud feature every time. So I can‚Äôt use that feature or load from lite. Disappointing.  Edit: updating to five stars. Developer responded in one day to major bug, and fixed it fully in less than a week. Impressive."
"804",351939099,"congrats to making it to ten years! and this game is still receiving updates! 10/10"
"805",351986992,"I have used this for quite some time, and it works just fine for me, as I am an amateur and probably don‚Äôt know any better."
"806",351986992,"I got the free version of this app I think about 4 years ago when I was outside one evening looking at the sky trying to win a bet with my wife about the Big Dipper and Little Dipper. It doesn‚Äôt matter who won the bet!üò° Anyway it was so awesome I purchased the full version right away. Now I use it to find out when their will be meteor showers, comets, satellites or even the International Space Station. I use the reminder function so The family doesn‚Äôt miss anything cool. Not only does it remind of events, it shows you where to look for the best chance of seeing meteors, it lists all the stars, constellations and planets. Plus, when viewing comets or satellites or other moving objects it will track them so you just hold up the phone and follow. We love this app, it is super fun, so much so that the kids don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre learning. I would recommend this to anyone. The free version is fine but the premium is definitely with the few pennies it cost."
"807",351986992,"So happy with this app, extremely accurate. Told me when the International Space Station would be visible and tracked it across the sky. Very impressed."
"808",352000376,"I have been using this app for years and I absolutely love it. My only problem is that the data doesn‚Äôt automatically transfer across my devices, eg. iPhone to iPad or vice versa."
"809",352000376,"Developer needs to improve and bring this app to the modern age. iCloud backup, iPhone X, XR capability, new tiles, etc. Please update and stay modern!"
"810",352000376,"I love this calendar BUT it lost my email and will NOT let me fix it and since I can find no other way to contact anyone I guess I have to make it as a review maybe someone at the app support will notice me. Please help."
"811",352199775,"Didn‚Äôt even get through one day of tracking before they forced me to download a game and then the water log never came back up. Thanks for nothing"
"812",352199775,"I have had this app for awhile and really love it. I bought the app when I first got it but now after some time I get ads as if I never paid for it. It‚Äôs just very frustrating every time I log I have to watch an ad. What‚Äôs more frustrating is I paid for it"
"813",352199775,"I used to love this app, loved it so much I purchased the upgrade in March 2018.  Here it is September 2019, and I cannot get into my upgrade because of ‚Äúerrors‚Äù AND I  now have to watch an ad EVERY time I want to log my water...... it is now a terrible app.  So bad I am going to delete it!"
"814",352247139,"The clean interface is gone.  What happened to seeing one meal at a time?   Where is the swipe and copy yesterday‚Äôs lunch/breakfast?  I have photos turned off but background picture takes up as much space.   Where are icons?   App takes along time to load.  I wish I could attach a screenshot but I AM using Netdiary.  When I select breakfast or any meal I get a screen with a list of the meals followed by a + sign, barcode sign and ellipses sign.  There is no swipe to copy.   It is still there for exercise.  Not changing rating.  Green square with green apple in the middle that has a tape measure around the middle....the word Pro at an angle in the upper left corner.... been using it for years.   MyNetDiary.  Seriously dislike the new view for iPad.   If I wanted the wide landscape mode, there is MyNetDiary HD.    So, still not changing rating.  Also,  then why does swipe work for exercises?"
"815",352247139,"I tried about ten similar apps before landing here. Of the ones I tried, FitBit did ok, but as I‚Äôm switching to an Apple Watch I don‚Äôt really need that app anymore.   This is the one I found that was for sale! Most apps are subscription only or are missing key features. To be fair there are some things in this app restricted to subscribers, but so much is available for the small fee for the Pro app that I‚Äôm thrilled. Especially love the bar code scanner."
"816",352247139,"It is very user friendly! To add foods, water, exercise, steps and measurements. I love the recipe and special food and meals."
"817",352509417,"I have been subscribing to the Washington Post for about eight years, and I‚Äôm very happy with the online edition. I also like being able to see it in the print format on my screen. The newsletters are great; they summarize the news in the areas of greatest interest for me. But another outstanding feature is having the screen be black with the print in white at night. I can catch up after a long day without having all that blue light crowding my retina. Very thoughtful!"

Honestly I found the iPad an easier tool for successful landings than I am experiencing with my iPhone. I don‚Äôt know why and won‚Äôt venture a guess but short of sitting next to a simulated crew member during descent and upon stop, opening the door and walking down the ramp to the tarmac with them and waving at the TV Cameras in the distance this is just a blast of game that requires you to pay attention, focus, think, learn new skills and have a blast all at the same time."

"830",353573707,"Instead of using your finger have it so you can change it to looking around if u have a headset thing for it it makes the app more enjoyable"
"831",353573707,"What's the fun of this if I can't look around ?"
"832",353642901,"do not waste money on this. you‚Äôre better off using your internet browser. not because it doesn‚Äôt work. but the interface on a browser is 10x better than the app. for example. i did the quiz to name all countries of europe, instead of giving you the map of europe and locating the name of the country when you get it correct, it just gives you a list and that‚Äôs it. don‚Äôt pay money for this when you can get a better version but just going on the website itself"
"833",353642901,"Waste of a couple bucks. I deleted the app about ten minutes after buying it. I assumed it would be somewhat similar to their web based geography quizzes, but there are no maps. ‚ÄúName the countries of Europe‚Äù or other similar quizzes are literally just you typing out the names off the top of your head on a notepad. Seriously, who designed that crap?"
"834",353642901,"Average scores would be nice."

"844",354974729,"Freeze is annoying since it has to be at least once per hour, probably at least twice that. I had it twice after boss fights and once it did it three times in a row with no activity in between. There is definitely a strong tendency to do it at stores probably 2-1 more than all other causes. Also seems like right hand merchant for items is the worst. Another complaint is that item and beast names are different than in my ‚Äúofficial‚Äù strategy guide. I love the FF franchise so I play through it. I would be screaming and foaming at the mouth if any other game did this and I did saw warnings in other reviews."
"845",354974729,"This game constantly freezes. Sometimes it‚Äôll go back to the home screen if you get out of the app for a while. However, a few times this hasn‚Äôt happened. The only option in this case is to delete the app and download it again. The problem with this is it deletes your save data and there is no cloud saving in this game. I‚Äôve tried playing it twice, but I was unable to complete the game both times due to this bug."
"846",354974729,"Come on guys release a fix for this game already. You can‚Äôt keep selling it and not keep up with bug fixes. I have iOS 12.3.1 on and iPad Air 2 and can only play for about 10 minutes and then a random crash. Generally happens after a battle."
"847",355524910,"Always among the favorites I come back to over and over again. Wonderful game, challenging campaign, and highly replayable.  The ‚Äúbest time‚Äù is a particularly smart feature as I am always happy to try and break my old record.  Well done, Team17!"
"848",355524910,"Games like this are rare these days, you pay a small fee up front and can play all day everyday without blooming ads.

The one thing I don‚Äôt like, is that even after you purchase the app, they then create another app with new features and charge you more money to get those features. In their new app you can do videos which would be wonderful. Except I‚Äôve already paid five dollars for this app I‚Äôm not going to pay more money to get the same features just the video. If you charge somebody for an app - you update the app you don‚Äôt create a whole new app. (In my opinion)"

The original game you paid one price and got to enjoy the entire game. Now I pay for it and all sorts of features are locked behind micro-transactions.  Developers like Halfbrick, who once revolutionized mobile gaming. Are now just contributing to the corruption and downfall of modern video games.

"907",363317633,"I trusted the reviews and I regret nothing. I‚Äôve been searching for weeks to find a decent app to help me design logos for me and my friends YouTube channels and instagram and nothing has come close to being as easy to use as this while at the same time giving you the power to create something that‚Äôs all your own. Was especially excited when I went to draw freehand and the app corrected my crappy little squiggles and made them smooth lines, (with option to turn that function off) very user friendly for brand new artist with terrible penmanship!üòÇ"
"908",363317633,"And it keeps getting better!  I‚Äôve been using this app for years (under a different app name for a while) and I continue to easily turn out nice drawings that are more than adequate. Best of all, using the features does not force me into deep memory recall or searching for the feature I need after every update.  When I have had an issue it was always my fault, but later a new version would make the correct way to do it obvious.  For example, I always had a problem understanding the set operations like Union.  Not with the latest version‚Äîthey simply work obviously.  Now I wonder why I was ever confused.  The only other issue I‚Äôve had has been the shape libraries.  There isn‚Äôt really any problem with what is provided, I just want more‚Äîlike network device shapes.  I create my own, of course, but I never seemed to be able to find one that I needed. Somehow this was fixed.  I just created shapes for casters (fixed, rotating, locking) and there they are just where I need them when I want them.  It wasn‚Äôt automagic, it just worked like my brain though it should.  And that is why this program is great.  Unlike other drawing Apps, Graphic works they way I think it is supposed to so I don‚Äôt have to learn and remember vast minutiae of app oddities.  I already have to much of that rolling around‚Äîlike a pin-ball machine in my brain where there are rarely extra points for collisions.  So why can‚Äôt we have in-app purchases of shape libraries please, or a set of design rules and a website to share the things?  Not that I am complaining.  I have gotten every design drawing completed that I ever wanted, and without calling my friendly drafting expert!  And in jig time.  Thanks."
"909",363317633,"I been using this app when it was iDraw, now called Graphic. It has been my main go too vector tool with great success. It has continued to improve.

No phone, but I'll still have this fun game on my watch to keep me occupied while standing in line.   As the dev keeps mentioning, use the crown to control the ship. I'm having zero problems, just fun. I think operator error is the reason for low star ratings."
"917",363486833,"People are a bit critical of this game.  For 2 bucks it‚Äôs a cool watch game with retro graphics.   Use the Digital Crown instead of finger on screen for quicker control.  Dev seems to make frequent updates so even better."
"918",363486833,"Two versions of the exact same game, one game where you get one life with very little goals and a game that is ok at best. Not worth the price."
"919",363590051,"Best viewing platform ever created"
"920",363590051,"So I got an email from Netflix saying my account had been logged into from Egypt then got another email stating that my emails address had been changed.  When I called Netflix the only way to verify my identity is to give the card number on file. Seriously, that‚Äôs the only way to verify my account that I‚Äôve had for YEARS! Not giving my card number over the phone..... CANCELED!!! No more Netflix for us!!"
"921",363590051,"Only showing the title on the cover image primarily just makes me confused as I browse."
"922",363738376,"Really like it & use it al the time. It Needs a staff cut/paste feature ... a staff graphic that can be dropped onto the page anywhere. Also a feature like a screenshot, then edit down to a small pic of a passage, and then drop THAT somewhere else. Both functions would be fantastic. Thanks"
"923",363738376,"Simply awesome! Imported all my Musicnotes onto it. Organized it perfectly"
"924",363738376,"This app is a game changer for dealing with both organizing and annotating your music. Don‚Äôt wait... get it now."
"925",363992049,"If possible, will you please add ePub ."
"926",363992049,"Been using this for years.   Simple, easy interface that lets you read cbr, epub, pdf, jpg and more files.  Can download the Comicglass Media Server to get files from computer to iPad or iPhone or just use Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive.  Tried bunch of others but they seem to make the task of just wanting to read comics needlessly complex where this one doesn‚Äôt."
"927",363992049,"I still using this app with iPad 1.  I guarantee this app is best."
"928",364017607,"I really love the app but I CAN NOT STAND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STUCK WITH THE SLIDERS FOR ‚ÄòSIZE‚Äô (That‚Äôs Fine.) BUT THEN THE OTHER SLIDER WITH THE PAINT BRUSH IS ‚ÄúFLOW‚Äù And it won‚Äôt let you change it that I could find!!!  If there is a way Please let me know,   And the other pain in the... Seat.  Is it won‚Äôt let you shut off the eye dropper long press,   At first i set it at 2.0 witch I think is 2 Min. And that worked now at the same time 2.0 it does it in a second, So when drawing a little slow it keeps changing colors on me.....  PLEASE HELP!!!!  If those things were fixed then the app would be like 10 Stars in my opinion."
"929",364017607,"Love this thing. Easy to use. Very fond of export options and versatility."
"930",364017607,"This app is the only app I can use easily to draw, Photoshop, and more! I've been using this app for a very long time, but I have a few suggestions and comments, though. When you look at pictures from other people on the Online Gallery, it would be helpful to add comments so you can ask how you drew something, ask for/add tips, and more. It would also be neat if you could like someone's photo. Also, it would be nice if you added more pictures more often. I recommend this app-- and the money? Totally worth it! Don't hesitate, innocent citizen reading this- buy it! I rate this app 5 stars! Great work!  EDIT: I'm writing this five years later. Cringed at my old review. Anyway, the app keeps crashing and destroying my art!! Glitches and makes it completely trashed. Please please please fix!!"
"931",364165557,"This is one of the best board game adaptations on my iPad. Everything flows smoothly. Access to the information on the races, special powers and other things are a click away while in the game. I can‚Äôt recommend this game enough."
"932",364165557,"Family loves the game. It‚Äôs very competitive even against computer. Would love to see more updates as I have purchased all the expansions."
"933",364165557,"I never played the actual board game but if you want a polished board game that is entertaining and contains just enough strategy then this is highly recommended.  The amount of sheer combos of and ever present ability to switch combo characters on the fly adds endless possibilities.  Presentation is awesome and user friendly. A great gem of an app.   With the fast forward button, games are a mere 10-15 min and if you exit it's saved.  I picked up Be not Afraid and can't wait to play it.  I have not tried online multiplayer though so I can't speak to that.  But solo games can be with bots or bots + other pass and play people."

"939",364191819,"Kinda a big bummer"
"940",364204209,"Good game for kids  It‚Äôs a great game but it needs a better version not a bad thing dawnlod it naw"
"941",364204209,"PLAY IT PLAY IT LOVE IT ADDICTION"
"942",364204209,"I just ""rediscovered"" this on my iPhone, and bought the iPad version because good games deserve support. If only I could remember how to win!"
"943",364500115,"One good feature of the last version (2.x) over this one, was fixed digit widths on the tape, so the numbers (digits) aligned vertically.   Maybe (option of) changing the font of the numbers on the tape can solve this.  Other than that, everything is great, Thanks!  Update: The fixed digit widths on the tape as an option came to Digits! Thanks, you are GREAT!!  (Setting>Font>Monospace Tape Values)  Bug! Why the result of sin(30) is shown as 0.499999999... and not 0.5?!  Why large numbers are truncated in middle?  Suggestion: Option to display fixed decimal if there are fractions, and show as a simple number if there aren‚Äôt fractions. (Show 12.3456789 as 12.345 and 12 as 12, not as 12.000)"
"944",364500115,"I‚Äôve used this for several years and it has never let me down. Easy, multi-functional, and has every possible option you need in one app. I was concerned when there was a big ios upgrade that the developers would just give up and drop any future upgrades. No so, got even better. It‚Äôs the best $0.99-1.98 you will ever spend on any app. Period!"
"945",364500115,"Nice to get your bills organized and budget your expenses. No need to wait for your excel file to open. Just type your numbers and edit accordingly updating the results automatically. I opted for the export function as well to share the ‚Äútape‚Äù (output) with my family.  It‚Äôd be nice if one could also import CSV files."
"946",364502063,"Recently purchased this app to manage pdf files.  There are zero instructions.  I was unable to view any files on my iPad Pro. Extremely disappointed that I wasted my time, energy and money on this knock off version on Adobe Acrobat.  Lesson learned. Do not purchase this app!"
"947",364502063,"I wish I could crop PDF files and have the pages change by scrolling down or up instead of left or right.   The instructions on how to print were not great.  The icons were too small and the print symbol is minute.  The support pdf is not great.  It did not show the process.    When finished managing a file by changing its name or emailing etc, I have to quit the app in order to get back to reading the PDF files."
"948",364502063,"Purchased app for one purpose: to edit a pdf.  After some difficulty I was able to transfer the pdf from Adobe Acrobat to this app.  Although I can open the pdf, I am unable to do any editing.  Highlighting, scribbling on it - yes, but no editing as was promised in the app description.  2 emails to developer went unanswered.  Disappointed overall.  When I am driving sometime, I‚Äôll call 800-myapple and get my money back."
"949",364738545,"I was delighted to find file browser. This way I could wirelessly transfer items between my ipad and desktop. It is a very reliable app and I use it daily to back up to an external drive. It has to be set up with your router but it works like a charm."
"950",364738545,"I‚Äôve been using it for several years to access my Sinology NAS from my iPad and iPhone.  A great app!"
"951",364738545,"I bought this app hoping it would help with transferring videos and images from my iPhone to my desktop. AirDrop is fine for individual files that you don‚Äôt mind having compressed and preview works some of the time so I was looking for a better way to transfer media files. After getting error messages on over 70% of the videos I‚Äôve tried to transfer I was hoping I could cancel my purchase but there is no option to contact customer service for this app via the App Store."
"952",364740856,"I was unable to reload the program after purchasing all of the options since I got a new iPad. I have tried to contact the programmers to no avail. If you happen to need to reload this program you will lose the options that you paid for."
"953",364740856,"Takes forever to load because it‚Äôs pulling down ads and other useless bloat like ‚Äòword of the day‚Äô.   As a dictionary I was not impressed."
"954",364740856,"One of the things I love about the iPad is the multitasking functionality and the ability to do split screen mode with so many apps, being able to have an app for whatever reference I might be needing sitting alongside my main app. It would be really lovely to have my dictionary (the OG reference tool) just be able to saddle up next to what ever I am reading or writing, with out having to switch screens. Without that, I might as well just make a safari shortcut and keep the website beside what I‚Äôm doing. And this one feature on an app ‚Äúfor iPad‚Äù is worth losing two stars."
"955",364762290,"For 3 or 4 years now, I‚Äôve been using this app for 2D animation. I really enjoy it and how simple and easy it is to animate unlike some apps. There might be some bugs but other than that I definitely recommend this for others. It helped me grow on my YT Channel too so yeah, thank you DoInk :)"
"956",364762290,"This has been fun to learn and use.  I have a classroom full of kids and some are getting a black box around an element when it is brought into Green Screen.  It can be an element from the app or one drawn by students.  Very frustrating, and cant find an answer!"
"957",364762290,"Hey.. I don‚Äôt typically post reviews for apps, but this is a special case.   The app‚Äôs animation itself is okay, although the editor is a bit hard to work with and offers no explanation at all.  The concept is as if they took an incredibly easy to use kids app and dipped it into some professional apps in the sense with the tools are a bit hard to figure out and you have to toy with it for a bit to understand them.  I did like the tweening, though.  Overall, this app would be getting a better review if it was free with a pro version or something,   if you‚Äôre searching for an animation app try FlipaClip, (don‚Äôt mean to advertise, just my personal reference)"
"958",364899325,"Was enjoying creating rollercoasters! Then I add and remove the trees, maybe switch the type of them to and the app crashes!! Help!"
"959",364899325,"It‚Äôs the best thing ever and much cheaper than planet coaster! Love it. Amazing. But can you make it compatible with MacBook Air and Pro because I want it on my Mac."
"960",364899325,"First I will there was an option so it could be wooden but nothing else this might be the shortest review EVER have the best day! ‚ô•Ô∏è  Yas  Your  The  Best  Woooohooooo"

"964",365152940,"It‚Äôs so easy to organize the photos from the iPhone to the computer.  Then you‚Äôre not getting shut out of your cell phone."
"965",365152940,"Finds duplicates. Easy to transfer photos to different cloud services. Highly recommend."
"966",365152940,"I have been using Photo Transfer for several years now. I have found it to work very effectively and permits me to work with my IPhone and at the end of the day download my work flawlessly. I can highly recommend this app. It does what it was designed to do very well."
"967",365235835,"I think the title above is pretty self explanatory. The app won't even let me update !"
"968",365235835,"Saw a lot of Japanese Brazilians and American people. It was fun to chat to them. You can also talk to them like FaceTime but broadcasting, called collabo."
"969",365235835,"I love watching my friends live! Easy to use and fun!"
"970",365724094,"the best application, simple - quick to use and optimized"
"971",365724094,"I‚Äôve enjoyed using Ski Tracks for going on 3 years but this year the app is not recording data correctly. It doesn‚Äôt give me the correct mileage or altitudes. I‚Äôm disappointed it‚Äôs not working and may have to go to using another app."
"972",365724094,"it keeps asking me to enable background refresh in settings but it‚Äôs already on"
"973",366195670,"I am a member of an astronomy club in California and we have several public Observing events.  It is a real thrill for visitors when we can tell them that evening exactly when to start watching the exact place on the horizon where the moon will rise.  No matter where we are!"
"974",366195670,"I had a problem getting Skyfire to work in TPE. Stephen was very helpful. It didn‚Äôt take long and we had the issue fixed. Response time was very quick. TPE is pretty awesome. I hope to get a lot of use from it for planning in depth photography locations."
"975",366195670,"Don‚Äôt leave home without it. And use it often BEFORE you head out for a shoot!"
"976",366247306,"Great game! Are you coming out with Sudoku for the Apple Watch?"
"977",366247306,"I played this game for years but deleted it off my phone after the last update because of the ads. Even with the sound turned off they would play (with sound) after every game.  They also run constantly across the bottom of the screen and if you accidentally hit the bar they pop up with sound. This is especially bad when you‚Äôre trying to not bother the people around you! This was a deal-breaker for me and they lost a loyal fan!"
"978",366247306,"It is an average Sudoku game. The only draw back is the way they position the number that you have to pick from.  They overlap each other and if you take your eyes off of them you tend to hit the incorrect number. The numbers need to be spaced apart."
"979",366562751,"I don‚Äôt think there is a simpler or more convenient way to buy tickets for any event, whether it be a concert, sporting event, or even a cactus juggling competition. Stubhub is the way to go!!!!"

"981",366562751,"Every time I buy tickets I receive the best deals!"
"982",366626332,"Latest update states finally update for this app. If we download the basic version, all our training history will transfer over. BUT as a paid member using the Pro version, we get additional options. What happens to them?  Today I was just charged my annual membership for the PRO features. Does that get reimbursed?"
"983",366626332,"Great App. Been using it for years and does everything I need it to."
"984",366626332,"Great app."
"985",366869252,"This app has gotten worse with each update.  What happened to the .75 speed?  Sometimes I need to slow an audio book down if there are accents, but the .5 speed is grotesque"

"990",367003839,"Love this site!"
"991",367242040,"Redownloaded for nostalgia, was not disappointed. I‚Äôm extremely surprised that there is still support for this game nearly a decade after release. Buy the extra levels, they are worth every penny. Sad to see that the creator stopped creating though; wish he still did."
"992",367242040,"Yo update the game to be more comfortable while playing on an iPhone XS. I‚Äôve had the app since day one. I suggest maybe making the screen bigger."

"995",367287593,"I love this so much"
"996",367287593,"I used to love using this app, it was a fun thing to do with the family. We‚Äôd sit around and call people we knew using one of the random numbers you could pay for. Now ever since the update this app is not enjoyable anymore. You either have to use your own phone number which is pointless, or use that external app that doesn‚Äôt work either. I wish you guys would bring this app back to its former glory. I have 45 tokens in my account that I can‚Äôt even use now"
"997",367623543,"Agree, sadly, with several comments about the slowness & need to RE install, restart my device, wait forever (really) before I can select another full episode, and a lot of times I just give up cuz I don‚Äôt have time to troubleshoot this app, I have work to do - I rely on being able to see the prime time stuff after the fact, cuz I‚Äôm usually not at home when it airs! Why did it work so well a couple months ago....? Getting very discouraged ... does Fox know it‚Äôs this bad? I want to give it more stars but can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs getting worse instead of better."

"1002",367706767,"I so enjoy the cams all around the world. A feature that I learned to use a few months ago is to post a message on the sites I go to often. Other cam watcher around the world also post in answer. I have learned how to use google translate to post in French, Dutch, Spanish and leave fun message for my cam buddies. It is like being on vacation and sitting on the hotel balcony people, animal and nature watching. The cams are live except in very bad or freezing weather. See you later, I am off to the Michigan Snowman Cam to see what animal are there now and have a look at the post with pictures to see if the bear showed last night."
"1003",368494609,"So far it works great it‚Äôs a pleasant to have something you can use for converting news apps thank you"
"1004",368494609,"Do NOT download this app. It will charge you $3.99 twice a month."

"1017",369266386,"I have used this app for years but this year noticed that the spaghetti models only include the USA and Canadian models.

"1021",369820957,"Mistakenly thought this converted voice to notes with the original voice kept with it.  That‚Äôs not the case.  For what it does do, I think it‚Äôs over priced and I wish I could take my purchase back.  Wasted money."

"1023",369820957,"Bug-filled and no update for over a year. Awful."
"1024",369838631,"I love the app. So I‚Äôm definitely not here to smear it. But there is an irritating bug in the breath rate. Several times I have it set to 5.4 bpm or 5.5 bpm with no adjusted start breathing rate applied. This is my harmonic rhythm, but I was finding it very hard to keep up. So, I measured it with a chronometers. Even though it is still set at 5.4 bpm the actual rate is 3 bpm.  This happens on the watch app as well.  I am hoping the developers read this an offer a solution. As soon as they do, its back to 5 stars."
"1025",369838631,"A well-designed, well executed app which performs its function beautifully. it really helps me unplug at the end of the day."

"1028",369849199,"An App worth purchasing. Seeing that many ‚Äúladies‚Äù today are phony and only want materialistic B.S. the app is how a girlfriend should be like ."
"1029",369849199,"I LOVE this game. It‚Äôs really fun. O think it could have a few changes though. Like a verbal response to what ever the  girl says and for there to be more options (other than four options or using real money) to get in game money"

Suggestion: I'm not interested in my number of runs- I'm interested in score vs. time and keystroke."

"1041",372283316,"It was only $3 for the game, so no big deal, but the game is poorly thought out.  If a number isn‚Äôt used on the opening screen, it is impossible to highlight those numbers that you entered as pencil marks.  You should be able to highlight a pencil mark number and then place it on the screen in multiple places just by touching squares.  Instead you need to highlight a square first and then touch a pencil mark number.  You have to repeat this over and over."

"1045",372648912,"I‚Äôve had the app for a few weeks and so far I love it. It‚Äôs there when you need it and people can see you for about an hour after you close it. The only thing I ask you fix is the friend request quick message. I thought my phone froze and ended up saying thanks for the add about 7 times before the window closed. Thanks"
"1046",372648912,"I‚Äôve had my account for a few weeks now. But it keeps randomly logging out. And when I don‚Äôt remember my password. I try to get the email to reset it. It never sends one. Then wants me to put in my old password to secure my account. Like if I knew my password then I wouldn‚Äôt be in this circle. Tired of making new accounts for no reason."
"1047",372648912,"I never write reviews,but I‚Äôm honestly really annoyed with meetme. I have been using this app since the very beginning when it was My Yearbook. I‚Äôve loved it for many many years. But now it‚Äôs based mostly on streaming and how much money people make from it...I had gotten. Used to that,and had suggested my friend make an account. I lended her my phone to do so,and she received a screen prompt requesting she verify her account. She attempted to add her personal phone number that she has through a provider,but was told it was invalid. Then,I attempted to add my number and got the same issue. Now,I‚Äôve been unable to access my account for about 2 months & unable to get in even after redownloading the app. EXTREMELY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED. I‚Äôm all for more security but fix the flaws!"

"1052",373236724,"I mostly like this one and use it for guitar practice. Looping sections of songs or videos to play repeatedly, plus the ability to slow down the speed, are great features.

If you‚Äôre plan is to buy this app to remove emoji‚Äôs, don‚Äôt waste your money. Don‚Äôt be mislead by other reviews. This app removes emojis and leaves a smudge behind. If I could refund this app, I would, but there isn‚Äôt an option for that."
"1056",373311252,"I take a lot of pictures and have a lot of photography apps.

"1072",373903654,"Although I enjoy the content of Wired magazine, I would NOT recommend subscribing digitally through this app.  Once you subscribe, you will receive an incessant stream of spam from Cond√© Nast that will continue despite all your attempts to unsubscribe and mark as junk mail.  It‚Äôs been such a pain that I‚Äôve canceled my subscription."
"1073",373903654,"And background?"
"1074",373903654,"Since moving to the iPad several years ago as my primary reading device, there are certain standards that I have come to expect with my digital publications.   The number one requirement is that the content supports both portrait and landscape modes, not just portrait mode, as WIRED still only does. I and most people I encounter who use an iPad use some form of case and/or keyboard cover that puts the device into landscape mode for TIME magazine used to offer both modes, but then they went portrait-only and I found it totally frustrating and dropped the subscription.  There are several other digital publications that don‚Äôt suffer from this problem (I‚Äôve used the ZINIO reader for a few things), so this is not a difficult problem to solve.  Other reviewers have commented on the lack of zoom and other viewing controls and I agree with their concerns.  Finally, the new ‚ÄúSwipe down‚Äù control isn‚Äôt as easy as the prior control.  If you‚Äôre not careful, you‚Äôll swipe down from the top and reveal an iPad control, not the WIRED app control to get back to the menu and settings.  This is not as intuitive and it doesn‚Äôt work as well.  I‚Äôd just assume see the older control where you tapped on the content to reveal the menu bar at the top.  Please listen to your customers while you have them and make these changes.  These are much more fundamental things and make more of a difference than animated cover pages and other bells and whistles."
"1075",374151636,"This app ended up completely useless. The only export options give you low-res jpg/ pdf files that are unreadable.

I use this game as a way to connect with my family overseas, as well as have fun with my wife when we are apart.   Please bring us more expansions! We‚Äôll gladly buy them! :)"
"1092",375295479,"First, this is one the the absolute best ports from a board game to digital that exists.   One suggestion to make gameplay better:  when in the dragon phase and the dragon only has one possible legal move, it would really help move the game along if the system just made the moves automatically. The dragon already adds a lot of time to Internet games. This would make the experience much better and seamless."
"1093",375380948,"Total scam"
"1094",375380948,"Inexplicably, this app doesn‚Äôt support FaceID (as of 9/2019).

I made a call to tech support to see if it was just my install and after researching, the tech said it was expected behavior.  Seems like an oversight that hasn‚Äôt been addressed (for too long now).

"1102",376202925,"This app is a pain to use. The sign-in is annoying and should be replaced by fingerprint ID.

They alert you to messages that are really just more ads and there is no way to opt out. It is hard to navigate.

The bigger issue is trying to get photos loaded to Twitter or Facebook.  I‚Äôve yet to be able to do it because the upload always fails immediately.  I‚Äôve tried to contact the developer to no avail.  Also if you go about it in the longer way by saving it to your Photos on your phone then trying to upload it to Facebook, it still doesn‚Äôt work.  The app messes up the EXIF data so Facebook doesn‚Äôt recognize it as a 360 photo.  Basically you can take cool 360 panoramas but can‚Äôt do anything with them..."
"1122",377342622,"This app would be cool if it didn‚Äôt lose track of where the pano was in physical space.  For some reason it drifts ever so slightly, causing tearing.  The only solution is to move the phone, but introduce parallax, which is not really a good solution.  Not sure why it doesn‚Äôt align based off of the accelerometer AND camera feed.  Just take what the camera sees when it‚Äôs on an already photographed part of the grid and double check occasionally.  I find even using the technique I use for shooting manually-stitched panoramas do not work with this for a full sphere.  It‚Äôs not useless for hemispheres, though.  Never had accelerometer issues with this phone: it‚Äôs fairly new, and the few AR apps I‚Äôve run work very well with no graphics drift."

That was a week ago and I've heard nothing despite a 3rd email I sent a few days ago.   * updated after developer responded. I still have no resolution to the routing issue and no further responses from horrendous tech support.

"1330",391297152,"I have owned this game for many years it. I play several games a day and have purchased a number of add ons. The artist lost their way for a while but a recent update has thrown away the insipid tiles of the past 2 years and moved closer to the original releases which were top notch. I hope they eventually allow the option to select both the tile sets used and the game board as the original was simply inspired. The current set is quite good but the earliest board and tile set gives the game a great apocalyptic mad max feel that the later 2 iterations have not quite captured. The Ai us sometimes a bit stupid. Looks like it was never tweaked to correct issues. Eg the Sharrash Ai almost never uses one of its best pieces, ‚Äúthe hole‚Äù  which is a must use pice whenever I am playing that race. Another issue is that sometimes the Ai draws 2 fight tiles and an attacker, and instead of putting the attacker down it will discard it and use one of the attack initiations when the obvious thing to do would be to deploy an attacker and then initiate combat. Or maybe it draws 2 attacks and a movement tile and it won‚Äôt use the movement to avoid getting smashed in the attack its about to initiate. Other things it does is certain races have a race they are hard wired to attack, even though it would be far wiser to attack another race so it can win. Really bizarre really."
"1331",391297152,"This is a terrible game boring slow and dumb"
"1332",391297152,"When I picked up this game I didn‚Äôt think I would like it. I can confidently say a week later that it may have been the best five bucks I‚Äôve ever spent. I think one thing that could make this game better is more free to play factions."
"1333",391304000,"This is my first ever App Store review, and its for this app. This app is my go to navigation app, along with google maps. I‚Äôve tried tens of other apps, and none beats the value or functionality this app. For a one time $4 fee, I‚Äôve got everything.   Features I found really useful/invaluable- 1- offline nav. There are other apps that also offers this, but the value isn‚Äôt there. They either ask for a subscription, or their maps aren‚Äôt as detailed or as useful. 2- choice of maps. In the states I like usgs topo, or topo map 1 or 2. Elsewhere, topo map 1 seems to be my go to- it has a lot of bike lanes mapped out around urban areas, and the terrain features are succinct. 3- route building. There are a few routing services (mapquest, graphhopper, yours) that you can play around with, and generally they are on point. They have a good balance between directness, best route for your method of going (biking, car, hiking, etc), and common sense (not trying to go above be the highest mountain even if it‚Äôs the most direct) 4- search. Search feature/point of interests surprisingly will show up even the most obscure place in remote areas 5- various app settings. All super useful - you can manually reduce gps accuracy, change overlay settings to make things easier to read, all super useful when I‚Äôm looking for a no frills app that will make efficient use of my precious iPhone battery. Other apps look and seem clunky that will take up tons of battery, all for a nice shiny look, but with crap functionality 6- recording. You can record and export your gpx file, super useful for journaling and keeping track.   All in all, I keep coming back to this app. Other apps seem seductive, but this app does it all and it does it with no fuss, all bang. You guys rock!"
"1334",391304000,"This app seems to lag sometimes and has difficulty loading maps in mountainous areas. I tried loading maps while on forest service roads, where I had cell signal, and the maps would freeze and not load as I zoomed in to look for roads and plan a route. I have purchased the full app, so I‚Äôm disappointed so far. I‚Äôll continue to use it and hopefully have more success. This should work fine without cell reception anyway, seeing as how it is based on GPS for location, versus cell reception and data."
"1335",391304000,"I have been using this app for about two years now, and it has proven itself useful time and time again. The GPS is surprisingly accurate, and the terrain models show a sufficient amount of detail. The ability to save offline chunks and plot and track routes is what makes this app awesome. It has saved me many times when the trail disappears under snow or I decide to take a ‚Äòshortcut‚Äô or excursion and lose the trail. It helped me through a 5-day trip in the Sierra range, as well as more day hikes than I can count. It also has proved useful for plotting overland 4x4 trips. Can definitely recommend. Only problem is the step-up structured payment system... it would be nice to just have one Pro version that gives full access to whatever the app can offer.  tl;dr: This app is accurate, helpful, and awesome. Only drawback is the payment structure. Recommend for any outdoor enthusiast."
"1336",391432693,"So now I don‚Äôt even get to decide which orientation my canvas is at?  Move the iPad and phoomp like magic, it‚Äôs back to some idiots predetermined setting?  Why?  What‚Äôs the point?  How hard is it to simply let the artist, let the designer, simply determine their own needs?  But no, instead let‚Äôs just keep dumbing it down for the masses, for the ‚Äúhome user‚Äù, remove tools that were useful, make it easier for a generation of Snapchat idiots.  Well done...  Rage is simply more dying garbage in the toxic ecosystem that is iOS and Apple.    There‚Äôs just no real useful, decent software out there, and what is will like be turned into a subscription service designed to rob the user of Choice, freedom, and their money.

Young students might simply click on as many stars as possible as opposed to clicking on the right stars since there is no consequence for wrong answers.

Now RC Solutions thought it is better to pay a monthly fee for the ""premium"" version which does the same as my previous paid add-ons. There is even ""High Speed Delivery"".

Update 5/13:  While I appreciate the three or so updates over the past month (having gone without any updates for more than 3 years), the artificial intelligence (or ""computer"") opponent, when playing on the hardest setting, is permitted an unlimited number of back-and-forth moves in the same two spaces; whereas than the human player is afforded apx. two.  How can the Developer justify this? The computer and the human players must be able to play by the same rules, and on a level playing field, or the game will continue to periodically receive a decreased rating from me."

And when i want to redo the campaign i push next and it doesn‚Äôt even give me the next battle! #3. Again about campaigns I don‚Äôt like how they criticize you after you did your best to win! Especially in ‚Äúnapoleon‚Äôs waterloo‚Äù napoleon criticizes you like CRAZY becase you try your best to win and then you lose then he pops up and says ‚Äúmy plan was flawless you just didn‚Äôt execute it properly‚Äù or something really annoying. so i‚Äôd like for you to consider these changes and please fix atleast 1 or 2 of them  Thank you."

Worse yet, upon going into settings, the number would change from the original one given.

"1483",400971700,"Used to work fabulous with only hardcoded ip addresses. Now it is terrible. Discovery doesn‚Äôt usually work. App forgets my hardcoded ip addresses. If the system is off and I try to add back a hard coded address, it doesn‚Äôt work. Because of all this, the app is worthless unless the directv Box is already turned on. This was a great alternative to DirecTV‚Äôs uselessly bloated app. Please put it back the way it was!"

"1486",401301276,"I am very picky about games for my iPad and/or iPhone. This is, hands-down, one of the absolute best games I have ever played. I first got it years ago and keep re-playing it. I want a World of Goo 2. (Developers- please make a new one.) This game is unique and challenging without being impossible. Highly recommend it."
"1487",401301276,"So I used to play world of goo on my Desk top way back in the day, and was completely addicted. Obviously I was delighted when I found this app, however there is an issue. I can not seem to say my game and continue it later as the same user. The app forces me to start over as a new user each time, and I cannot imagine this was intentional. Love the game, and am annoyed by this version."

"1527",403858572,"This latest iteration of Fruit Ninja is a complete shadow of its former self in my opinion. It's one that is totally corrupted by micro-transactions by all accounts.  When I first bought Fruit Ninja on my Android devices and then now Apple devices, forever ago, the game was brilliant in my opinion. But, over the years this once great title has just gotten worse and worse with the inclusion of myriad in-app purchases, advertisements and ultimately - developer greed.  I think it would be so cool if, Halfbrick, offered a classic version of Fruit Ninja as a one time purchase, with no vile advertisements for other Halfbrick games or otherwise and absolutely no in-app purchases. Sadly, because of the aforementioned greed I just really don't see that lovely idea ever happening.   You'd think that after all the money this developer has made from Fruit Ninja and its other titles, that they would be cool enough to offer a classic version of this game. Like I said, though, I don't ever see that happening with Halfbrick truly being lost to greed.  That fact is very unfortunate in my opinion because this used to be one of the best video games available on mobile devices and elsewhere I always thought. Heck, I even bought a copy of Fruit Ninja for my Xbox 360 back in the day to play it using Kinect. And let me tell you, that was an awesome way to play this game, using your arms like swords to slash fruit and rack up crazy combos. I found as well that it was a really good physical workout.   So, I have no aversion to spending my hard earned money on quality video games offered by ethical and moral developers/studios. But Fruit Ninja and Halfbrick are so far removed from being ethical and moral now. That, honestly,  I refuse to spend even the lint in my pocket on the corrupted trash this once great title has truly become."

"1545",404593641,"As the title states, the app is horrendous. Trying to find the correct episode takes way too long, and when I click on a specific video another will start playing. This is not user friendly whatsoever. On top of that, the app crashes multiple times, it‚Äôs almost as though you have to take your absolute time to find the correct video and you have to be absolutely sure it is the correct episode. I am dissatisfied with this app. Nonetheless I‚Äôll still have to use it if I want to watch some of my favorite shows being that I‚Äôm constantly away from home.

Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan are squished together. Also, new countries (and maybe territories, too) would be good.. Like Kosovo, Greenland, Western Sahara, and more.

The programmers have taken all the fun out of the game and made it the most frustrating game....average every game of more than 50% of the spins resulting in not even a single number.  Who wants to be frustrated when they‚Äôre supposed to be relaxing and having fun.  Sorry programmers, you lost finally lost me.  I kept hoping the game would get better."
"1625",409890132,"Great job on this. Much more fun than the AOL version and I loved the AOL version. It takes everything from the classic version that was good and expands it.  Update: I actually took a star away for the unprofessional nature in which the developer decided to take away features I'd already paid for and make me pay another $3 to get them back and buy ""Part 2"". Luckily I like this game so much and I don't mind supporting the developer but it's not cool what you did!"

Ugh üëé that's not right.   What gives? Anyone know what I can do to fix above problems please write a review & help me.   Your help is appreciated please???? ü§î Question can you download again from purchased in the APP store & it work to show all people that are playing the challenge plus keep my progress?

The only problem I have with this app is that it loses wifi contact once in a while and I have to shut my computer down and restart to get the app back online.  It doesn't happen very often but when it does happen it is annoying.  Also I can‚Äôt find anywhere but I can add subtitles , I have a few movies that I need subtitles floor .  I would give this app four and a half stars, out of five stars."

"1632",410089731,"I had been using carb manager for a few months. I love it for tracking net carbs and finding out new recipes from other users. It would remind me daily about premium for $40 a year. I thought about it but figured I didn‚Äôt need it since I only was using it primarily for tracking net carbs. That was until I got a Fitbit. Which to sync it I needed to buy into the premium. I sucked it up to buy it. Which it a equivalent of 4 hours of my work day. Part of syncing you need to go into the site. Imagine my delight to find out just a matter of 10-30 second after purchasing it on the app and switching to online I was offered it for $30. Wait I just paid $40 for it.... so why offer the discount AFTER I paid for it? I figured I would reach out to costumer service. Joke! They won‚Äôt offer a refund of $10 due to inconvenience. They said they don‚Äôt offer the discount even if it was shown right after it was paid for.üôÑ. I am a manager in costumer service and let me tell you, that is not how you treat a costumer. I will be calling my bank to tell them to make sure the $40 gets cancelled. Along with forwarding this review to apple and Fitbit."

"1639",410319945,"I'd honesty give it zero stars if it would let me... let me start with this is no QWOP. Instead of you pressing the buttons Q, W, O, and P you now have to rotate TWO joysticks each with four functions for the legs that the joysticks control... the only thing that this states with QWOP honestly is the title, the motivation, and the fact that your character is apparently named QWOP. If you had a hard time using four buttons then have fun with what essentially equates to 8 and half the time you legs are very much exaggerated and don't match what they should be based on where the joystick is moved."

"1646",410395246,"The app is what you would expect with nite taking and flexibility in customization. My biggest gripe is when your WiFi connection is erratic, a message pops up in the app to warn you are offline and notes are not currently synced; if you‚Äôre handwriting a note, the location of the ink writing jumps off point and the jumps again when connection is restored. Really annoying if in a lecture hall with a weak or overloaded WiFi access point"

"1656",411430426,"This is an addicting game, but there are things you could add to make it better. What I mean by this is that you should add more features to the animals, such as their movements. I would even love it if there was an option to be one of the animals and you had to survive from a hunter, and you would be able to choose if you wanted the feature to be easy, normal, hard, or difficult. Also, it‚Äôs kind of a little bit frustrating when you kill an animal, and you can‚Äôt go very up close to it. This annoys me because I would like to get a very good close up to the animal that I killed so I could get a better look at it. I really hope you read this Tatem Games."
"1657",411711646,"I really love this app. It helps me memorize bible verses. However there is one thing I do find a bit inconvenient. I paid an extra 3 dollars to get the NKJV sense that‚Äôs what I like to read out of. However when trying to add my own bible verses to memorize them, it sends me to the web to copy and paste. I find this a little inconvenient, shouldn‚Äôt the NKJV already be in the app? It‚Äôs a little nag on such a great app, other then that I really recommend this app to anyone who is trying to memorize bible verses."
"1658",411711646,"I‚Äôve started using this app a few days ago and I‚Äôm already in love with it. My one and only complaint is some of the wallpapers don‚Äôt fit the iPhone XS Max screen.

"1660",411766326,"I‚Äôm on an iPhone 8. The app does not allow me to scroll through courses; it‚Äôs stuck at the top of the page no matter what.

Besides distances to the green, it showed distances to hazards, I could measure my drive distances, including club selection, but most importantly (to me), I could use it to keep score with a history of my score on various courses. What a disappointment on my first golf outing with my iPhone with this app when I couldn‚Äôt find how to enter my score. I assumed it was the same app I had used on my Android phone. Wrong! I should have known from the name SkyDROID that it was originally written to run on the competition and another clue should have opened my eyes when it was less money which typically means less function. I give it 1 star for ‚Äúdistance to the hole‚Äù, but if you‚Äôve used this app before on an android device you will be disappointed with this version. I found several free apps with much more functionality. I am currently using SwingU."

The clue says to use the rusty key to open a floating box in screen 22 in the spring. There is no floating box in screen 22 that I can find.  I have changed it to Spring & have examined other nearby screens and no floating box. There is only the open empty box in the lower half of the picture. I love the game and have completed other series of the Maple Tree adventure game series and am more than half way through another one. But in this one I am stuck. Please  developers I could use some help here or if anyone who has completed this puzzle would sure appreciate your expertise. I mistakenly presses only 4 stars. The game deserves 5 stars. There is no problem with the game but user error. I the user am apparently   having eye problems or trouble seeing boxes. Or this box is floating too fast, high, low or too much as I am missing it entirely Thank you anyone Candy"
"1707",414835676,"Nice long game - I really enjoyed playing."
"1708",415069562,"Creativity: none really, this type of gameplay has been used a lot before.   Story: Its a fun story, keeps you wanting to play more.  Levels: very repetitive, every level between the last one in each location is basically a filler level to make the game seem bigger.  Progression: very confusing, blob goes from being huge to tiny every level and it isn't clear that during the story when it gets hit it shrinks.  Price: a bit too high. I would say $0.99 would have been worth it."

"1714",415468221,"I thought that this app might be wonderful however, it is getting to be a pain in the butt. All I wanted to do was to create one single group and when I first tried it, easy drag and drop but NOT for all my contacts. I kept getting  a message about not being able to add contacts to my group because of Google exchange and that I had to create a group with a ‚Äòlocal‚Äô tag, Whatever that means.  So I tried to turn on ‚Äòlocal groups‚Äô using the slider but that did et work and in order to do so I had to delete my group and start a new one so the ‚Äòlocal group‚Äô slider turn on would workout now, I still can‚Äôt add my contacts I want to the new group, any of them.

The UI is a bit of a mess, selection can involve many taps, thumbnails are small and not resizable, configuration options are daunting. Try their support web pages for documentation. Once you get set up transfer can be simple and painless, easily backing up your photos to multiple destinations with many options for filing and renaming.

"1782",421168738,"We used to keep stats on paper, between three different clip boards between myself (assistant coach) and a couple JV players. They were never paying attention so on top of trying to coach and keep stats, I also had to keep track of their stats. With this app, I can do everything with the touch of my finger! Not only is it easy to use, the stats it gives me are AMAZING. I have never considered half of the analysis it provides. This app is a must have for every volleyball coach at any level."
"1783",421254504,"A few years ago I used to play it all the time. The gameplay is good and they have a variety of songs, but the problem became the ads. When I first got the app there was maybe an ad after every 5-7 songs or something around that. I think that's reasonable since none of the songs are full length so it's maybe an ad every 10-15 mins roughly. Time passes by and smule increases the ads to after every 2 songs u will get one which means getting an ad ever 4-5 mins, doubling the amount of ads. I dealt with it for a while but ultimately quit the game for about 2 years because it just became annoying to play. I played it for the first time in such a long time (after deciding that I would deal with the ads) to see smule actually upped the ads to before AND after every single ~2 min song u play! Now that is what I call just plain greedy and it's ridiculous. Just learning this disappoints me that a game I used to like so much became like this. It's just not worth playing anymore and it's a shame."
"1784",421254504,"I liked the trial but it takes too much to get to play the songs you want to play."
"1785",421254504,"I‚Äôve had this app for years and I really loved it for a while. I recently revisited and it‚Äôs changed to say the least. It takes for ever to load. Compared to other games I have  played, this takes the longest to open (I have an iPhone 8). The amount of ADs is obnoxious. There are Advertisements at the beginning and end of songs. I am having issues with the 3 and 4 finger taps. This was an issue on my last phone and it‚Äôs still an issue now.   It takes forever to earn coins to buy new songs and the free ones are not as updated as they use to be. In all honesty I would not recommend this game until at least the AD spam is dialed back a bit."

I‚Äôve tried Stitcher, original Podcast app, other podcast apps, and I can‚Äôt break away from PodCruncher. PodCruncher simply just works. No frills, no ads, it just does what it‚Äôs supposed to do: play and manage podcasts.   I subscribe to 52 podcasts so I need a basic podcast app to manage them all. I can create different playlists (my weekly shows, ‚Äúspecials‚Äù that I save for travel and if I run out of hours in the week, ‚Äúboring‚Äù podcasts that I fall asleep to), change the order around, and play around with the playback speed with ease.   Thank you so much for this app. In a world where Silicon Valley tries to read your mind and be intuitive and over complicated things, this app is a savior from it.   My only complaints are that it doesn‚Äôt work with Siri (like all 3rd party apps) and sometimes when I have 3 media apps on at the same time (like PodCruncher, Spotify, and Music), it gets wonky and my iPhone only likes the play Music. Just make sure you close all media apps before playing PodCruncher for the best playing experience."

This one is overblown in its self-references and unnecessarily pared down to having a single pixel as a face. Like, it took half the game to realize the protagonist uses female gender pronouns. It has style, but seemingly for style's sake. The paper-thin plot is left like a series of archetypal placeholders, Jungian references without fleshed out characters, and yet, there seems to be one character that shines through: the unambitious, possibly stoner college guy voice that took some basic 101 courses on literature and psychology and thinks it sounds pretty rad to work big words into a video game without knowing why or what they mean. Still, walking around a cosmic grotto for a gameplay is ok with me. Kudos for a game about nothing. That's the one thing I actually liked."

I love this game, I love the smartphone mode with upgrade equipment, and bullet hell games just feel right to me with the immediacy of a touch interface with no lag.  I missed this game a lot when it woulf no longer run on current OS versions, so I was ecstatic to see it revived from the dead.   Sadly, there is one massive issue for longtime players and several really annoying UI issues on an iPhone X.  The biggest problem by far is that, upon opening, I got an error message in Japanese that the save file is corrupt... and had ALL my smartphone mode goodies vanish. Given that I had spent many, many hours grinding literally all but a single item, this was frustrating to put it mildly. At least my purchased items restored correctly.  The remaining annoyances:  - On an iPhone X the curtain graphic extrnds all the way to the edges of the screen, but the touch area does not. This is s disaster, since it means you still need to keep your finger on top of the gameplay to control, and if you drift too far your character just stops moving.  - Likewise on the right side, the buttons aren‚Äôt in the extended screen, instead blocking the gameplay area for no reason.  - It doesn‚Äôt hide the swipe bar on an iPhone X so if you don‚Äôt use the Accessibility trick for licking yourself in the app or shrink the gameplay area needlessly, you will keep bumping it when trying to hit buttons.   - You can‚Äôt rotate the screen. This is notably annoying because in the orientation they chose my left hand is on top of the bottom side speaker so I lose the left channel of audio. Flipping the screen like 99% of landscape apps allow would fix this.   - Button targets at the bottom of the screen are wonky, so it is difficult to tap some shop buttons and almost impossible to get the shop previews to display.  - The word ‚Äúlong‚Äù in any cutscene text is replaced with ‚ÄúInt32‚Äù, which is possibly the most hilarious find-and-replace error ever.  On the positive side, this new version fixes text clipping errors in the shop, and you can full screen it and move the screen to the left or right as well.  C‚Äômon, Cave, at least fix the UI bugs. The save loss bug makes me afraid it‚Äôll happen again if I spend hours grinding rare items."

"1925",430823968,"I mistakenly bought this game thinking it was a universal app and that I could use an MFI controller like on the iPhone version. Well, you can't. I can't fathom why Square-Enix would have controller support for a 4-6 inch screen display, but not for the larger iPad screen.   I'm guessing they won't ever update this either. I also noticed the opening cutscene that plays in the beginning of the game menu is gone and it's just the word version. Not sure why they removed it but there's some really bonehead decisions going by on around here.   Just beware before you purchase. Technically I should blame the Nimbus companion app for not clarifying that FFIII controller support is only on the iPhone, but yeah..."
"1926",430823968,"I just got the iPhone 7 plus and tried download all of the Final Fantasy versions to it finding out that this is iPad version is not supported unless I pay another $15 for no major difference. I'll still give it 4 of 5 stars because it is still a great game."
"1927",430920838,"Just bought the physical board game and loved it. Tried playing a few games of this digital version and it's mechanically broken and ruining the game. It would hide tiles placed by opponents (something that should be knowledge for all players) and even after sending an explorer to the hidden tile it never revealed. It's either a game breaking bug or design flaw of this format that needs to be addressed before you bother to play this."
"1928",430920838,"I‚Äôve played this game many times, and love it. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a major bug in this version. I couldn‚Äôt see a number of the tiles that the AI players were moving into.

The same goes for when you want to view a game that your opponent has ended. Another waste of time. The amount of time it takes when you made your final move the hearing play to go through all the theatrics to be able to move onto the next game is also a waste of time. I do not understand the purpose of collecting these ‚Äúdice masters‚Äù set. Maybe children enjoy that but I can‚Äôt imagine adults do.

The most frustrating thing about this app is that it hardly ever casts to the TV especially lately, making it 100% useless for me as this is really the only time we use it. I hope the bugs causing this are fixed soon."
"2011",435476174,"I use this app every day with my special education students who need help learning letter formation using the Handwriting Without Tears formation guidelines.

The kids I work with along with my grandchildren really enjoy this app. Thank you Letter School!"

"2015",435693872,"I‚Äôve been looking for a calendar/organizer/planner app for a long time. I still haven‚Äôt found something that suits all my needs but I do appreciate the features of this calendar app such as being able to see labels on the calendar instead of just dots and having the day‚Äôs schedule always at the top.   I also appreciate the array of colors available to use as this helps me to organize events by colored groupings.  I wish the app would be updated for the iPhone XS Max so it could take advantage of its larger screen. The app is currently sized for a smaller phone so there are two large black blank areas on the top and bottom of my screen.   The addition of an integrated to-do list would be great as well. I currently have to use a separate app to address this need.  I appreciate that this app is a one-time purchase and not a subscription plan. I would gladly buy a newer version of the app at a higher price point if it offered more features."

"2018",435728260,"This app is so basic, as it has preset configurations that simply ask you to drag and drop the circuit element into the empty spot. There is NO ability to create circuits nor make measurements of voltage, current, or resistance. It does have some nice descriptions, and allows the user to make the connection between the real-world objects and the circuit diagram on the board, however this is suitable for elementary school kids. I am a high school physics teacher and was hoping for MUCH more functionality, and if this is what you are also looking for, save your $1!"
"2019",435728260,"""Don't do THAT! You'll create a short circuit!""  Words you won't have to say if your kid(s) use this app (and it's sister app, Serial Circuits).  My son is actually learning quite a bit blithely blowing up the virtual batteries - and figuring out how you have to connect them to blow up 4 at the same time, instead of just a paltry 2.  The tutorials that accompany the lessons (and the mistakes) are pretty clear.   If you are looking for a puzzle game - this ain't it.  But if you are looking for an introduction to circuits and electricity, then you have a winner.  No parts to lose, simple pick-up and the melted wires are self repairing.   My very paltry complaints: i wish the lightbulbs would grow brighter and dimmer to reflect different power levels, and the interface is a bit repetitive and rigid."
"2020",435871950,"The premise of this app is good but having an app to find vegan restaurants doesn‚Äôt magically make them appear.  When I first installed it it came back with nothing, so I went in to ‚Äúfilters‚Äù and increased the search radius to 50 miles and then one restaurant is listed.  So if I drive for over an hour I can get breakfast or lunch (they don‚Äôt serve dinner...) We don‚Äôt need apps so much as we need vegan restaurants! I would say save your $3.99 and use Yelp, but Yelp lists places as vegan that aren‚Äôt."

If you answer correctly the test will grade you as if you answered incorrectly and then show the correct answer as the same one that you answered!    This program was obviously never tested, or it was tested and the developer hasn't fixed yet, or does not care to fix."
"2025",435883126,"I've never seen such a kind of opportunity to learn and also teach the concept of circuits. By playing with the circuits in online playground, which is designed from basic to higher tasks, I explored the pathway mechanism of light bulbs in series.   Here are the reasons why I like the aps: -Providing six main circuit models let me create lots of light bulb-battery-key combinations and each time the user supported by the constructive feedbacks. -Since it is online, it is safe so no chance to get en electrical shock by accidentally. -App lets me to explore scientific evidences about the incorrect pathways such as short circuits in a very funny way as well as the correct ones."

I feel you should add a baby store with cribs, strollers, and bouncers and many more supplies for babies. You should also add a pet store with pets that you can take to your house for example cats, dogs, birds, fish, and so many more. You should also add other houses for a bigger families and more cars and a garage, if the game has so many characters it should have houses for more families, for example they should have a basement as well. You should also add more characters for example you should add Office workers , police  officers, fire workers, mailmen and many more. You should also add a pool for everyone but not as another app you should add the pool to the my play home app not as another app that you have to buy. You should also add more clothing to the clothing store for example if you will add a pool then add beating suits. You should also add a furniture store where you can buy new furniture for your house and redo your house so you can customize it in your own unique way. I think you should also add leg cast to the hospital and crushes. Thank you so much for listening I hope you can find a way to fit as much as you can possible thank you."

Flashes back and forth but goes back to Update....love this app but this is frustrating!!! Also now have to use coins if you want to begin with only the edge pieces!!! Didn't have to until recently...not fair since I play all the time!!!  Adding to this review...purchased Cuties puzzles but they wouldn't download even tho it said the pack was...no download line but puzzle now says. Restore but same thing...grrrrrr...??fix it???   April 4...still love the app and look forward to free monthly puzzles...use the app daily!!! One problem this month--when I start each new puzzle I have to check my settings...before this they were logged in how I had set them--not so for April...reverts back to lowest level every new one  Dec. 14...still love the app but this month we have a puzzle between puzzles for the month that requires not only to have the internet to see the mystery piece but the internet to download separately...again grrrrrr...then you have to surrender 100 coins to download it...I can do it because I do a lot of puzzles but 100 seems a bit high...some problems with download too...  Feb. 22...again--still love the app & work puzzles all the time...however...of late have had many freezing issues where it doesn't move & in order to get into the puzzle or download more I have to close the app & go back in!!! Often several times....grrrr again!!! Do you all even read these ratings anyway???  April 9...still love the app but some problems still persist!!! Again--do you ever read these--seriously!!! Having issues with app freezing & if doesn't correct have to close down, wait & hope it will clear!!!

Sept 21...Do you people even read these reviews???? Apparently not!!! Even though I enjoy this app & do the puzzles the speed of change has slowed down to a crawl compared to when I first downloaded the app several years ago...takes forever for the puzzle app to appear-several seconds of black screen...I did hear from the developer who promised to reset my points after an app in the shop proved to be not tested or viral...no points restored as yet                                                             Dec 3...a still love the app but glitches r still a problem!!!...did get 2 emails from ximad 2 send them some info but some of the info is hard to 2 find as instructed or my iPad Air is retarded!!!...takes a good 20+ seconds after bringing up the app for main choice screen appears...still having major freezing issues...sometimes the only thing that unlocks it is 2 get out of the app & start over!!!...very annoying & frustrating...the app did not do all this when it was first loaded & used...I know I am not the only one with these problems...  April 1st...(and not an April Fool post)...Kudos for some problem solving on my previous issues, at least they have disappeared for the most part‚Äîstill have to navigate the new screen which is more consolidated than previous one...still love this app and work it daily...  Dec 3, 2018 Much better and so far nothing like previous issues and screen navigation is ok. Love this app and play dailyü§ó   Mar 30 2019 Improved and much better but another oops has appeared...now the 9 cards to turn over one for points that appear each day don‚Äôt show up and movement from one puzzle to another is very slow and often hesitates before moving along.

July 18 2019 Some of the issues mentioned above still create problems...now when you get the pop up to move on it says ‚Äúwatch an ad‚Äù but there‚Äôs never an ad available so you have to shut down and move on...also happens with the card match pop up...do you even read these? Seems like it continues, regardless of the reviews....   September 5 2019 Still like the app only now there is another problem with the bonus cards for extra points‚Äîafter they display and rearrange as a fan & indicates to check for an ad for bonus ad...it says there is no ad, try again later‚Äî9 out of 10 times it does this...very regularly do you get a chance at anything else to earn more coins!!!

And yes there are seasonal events that are kind of fun to participate in, but they have a cool down time so you have 5 minutes of fun before waiting five hours just to do it all again. There is a competition which gives you more fun but it‚Äôs just an elemental race, so yeah. Anyway that is what I think of the game."

"2096",440488550,"I‚Äôve been using PlayerXtreme Pro for several months. It‚Äôs a very good video player. It can play some videos that other players are unable to play.  It‚Äôs the closest thing I‚Äôve found to a universal video player.  However, it needs a couple of improvements:  1. I enter the user name and password to connect to my Windows system and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.  However, if I close the app fully, I have to renter the account and password the next time I run it.  I want it to save the logon so I don‚Äôt have to re-enter it.  2. It needs to have controls to delete and rename videos while browsing the file list."
"2097",440488550,"Thank you for the pro version and I think that it‚Äôs very powerful app for cloud playing but the subtitles for other languages is not available sometimes and I am wondering how to play external audio (narration) instead of main audio."

I‚Äôm sorry to say I could even start a proper evaluation of this one, as it is so determined to collect my data before even slowing me to use it. The opening 3 minutes with this app includes personal data (standard, age, weight, height, birthdate), followed by an aggressive advert for pro version (with large timer as if they need to convert you within 30 seconds!) and then they want a Facebook account or create new account to login. I have yet to see one exercise? (Or a terms of service and privacy policy?)  For me accounts should be optional until I decide I want the features of storage or multi-device sync etc.   So far, this app was more in your face about sign up than any I had evaluated.

Transferring photos I gotta keep them at Keep? dumb  Stickers I gotta re-download them and worst, hrs to track previous purchases and even losing them..  Horrible experience, and as we change phones frequently each year it‚Äôs seriously annoying.  Please fix the mess, make messages and photos transfers more intuitive. You guys are LITERALLY the one and the most annoying item that stops people from switching over to new phones. (especially those who are technologically challenged).   People, encourage your friends/ group to switch over to other great services such who BACKS UP/ SAVE IN THE CLOUD of your chats/ photos . a more seamless experience.

Although most likely you will not meet many of these people, their lives and stories will become an important part of your life and prayers nonetheless. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling to hear someone say that they are praying for you specifically and to be able to reach out to someone even on another continent whose voice you have heard.

I like how a can duplicate or copy a group, check and uncheck and delete addressees within my group.

In Numbers I write a formulas that inserts a ‚Äú<‚Äú at the beginning of an email address and ‚Äú>‚Äù at the end. With the contacts name in the first column and the addresses formula in the second column, I simply import and manually paste. This creates is one paste my whole list. Easy as pie.

Of the many utilities I have downloaded, mailshot pro is by far the most useful one. In addition writing any problems to Peter, one always gets a response that he will look into it and the support is absolutely tops.  IOS9 I was very worried when I heard that the app no longer could select a group mail program as I send out a group of about 80 emails.   The two ways to work around the IOS9 change are excellent. If I am composing an email to a group, I do it in MailShot, if I am forwarding an email, I copy the group list from mailshot onto the clipboard and and paste it into the blind carbon copy line in mail. A little extra work but hopefully Apple will shape up and allow the app to work as previously."

"2225",447610616,"Loved the game on android but whoever programmed the IOS version didn‚Äôt really care one bit. The aspect ratio isn‚Äôt adjusted so the controls are too far for comfort and the wrong buttons get pressed continuously. The intro isn‚Äôt skippable. The game screws with all the sound on my phone.  Then there‚Äôs gameplay. Half the gnome‚Äôs shots don‚Äôt even damage the monsters; they just disappear. The panda will sometimes randomly die when slamming instead of killing the opponent. The frog‚Äôs tongue does not increase between upgrades 2-3 and gets caught on everything and doesn‚Äôt work. It worked well in the android version. And lastly, the bull. When charging, half the time it doesn‚Äôt kill the monsters! I just don‚Äôt understand.  I‚Äôve played this game for years and when I saw the poor IOS reviews I gave you the benefit of the doubt and paid for the game still. And now I see that I was wrong. Despite the numerous flaws I made it to Dark Lord mode in a few days, but beating that Christmas level is absolutely infuriating when I get the gnome, frog, or panda. Fix your game."

"2235",448142450,"I used to recommend Truecaller all the time. Paid for premium a long while now, but sadly the app feels like a former shell of itself. The primary feature of stopping spam calls barely works. A bunch of robocalls still get through unflagged. Number lookup never returns a result, ever. It used to and do so pretty well, but its useless now. Googling the number does a better job. Also it seems the auto-update list toggle doesn't actually update anything as much as it just hounds you with notifications to open the app and manually update it once a day. I won't be renewing premium and will be deleting the app. I'm out."

There were a couple of other interface annoyances but I could see past them.  Now, there‚Äôs no way ignore the trainers since they‚Äôre so chatty.  The generic encouragement interrupts my books/music and my flow.    I paid for this app and now it is difficult to use.  There should be a minimal trainer that just announces the segments."

I have rated them one star as they will not allow a lower rating"
"2251",450123799,"The word origins section has disappeared while it is still available in the iPhone version of the app, which is also at a higher version number. That suggests the app is receiving minimal maintenance."

"2253",450123799,"The etymologies of words, which this app calls ‚ÄúOrigins and History‚Äù (shouldn‚Äôt they be using the correct terminology?) are now all missing. This is very annoying. Etymologies are highly useful for language learning. This has always been a rather flakey app, however, and the developers flakey at fixing things. Buyer beware."

I mean I love all the new brushes and tools, just a small bug id like to point out. One, the app crashes more easy now. Like if I leave the app or open another tab for even one minute it logs me out and I have to reopen the app, so if I made a Mistake or needed to fix something i cant undo it now. Another, the transparent layers when compressed. For some reason, now when I combine a slightly transparent layer with another it changes it back to its original state which isn't what I want. If there was already an option before to change that id really like to know please. But yeah, apart from the crashing and the layer problem, the app is amazing and without a doubt my favorite drawing app. 10/10  I just hope these problems are resolved."

"2268",451287325,"We took a chance and bought the whole pack because my kids loved Monkey Preschool Lunchbox. My 5 year old loves this, especially the aquarium prizes! We love that there are multiple users and that it adjusts to her difficulty level based on her success in the games. Soon my younger one will be interested too and they can each have their own user in the game."
"2269",451901829,"The sound is remarkably soothing and it's relaxing to play with."
"2270",451901829,"Reading the description, I thought the app would generate movie type ocean sounds in a mechanical way.

You can see the knot from every angle.  The animations are clear and the speed can be controlled.  The color choices  make the illustrations very clear.  You can also view static images of the animations by moving your finger left and right across the image.  I especially appreciate the accompanying history, uses, related knots and safety precautions.  They are clear and concise.  It‚Äôs a lot easier to learn to tie knots using this app than it is using Ashley‚Äôs Book of Knots.  I have recommended it to my friends, family and anyone who expresses an interest in knot-tying."

I‚Äôm surprised to no extent! I think if you guys released a better and revised and upgraded version of this game it would blow up because the only things wrong with this game is the aspect ratio and graphics and how it displays and the upgrading system and story system and how you progress, if there is an actual story or even a better way of how you do the whole killing zombies to unlock more areas,  I hope you could make it so it‚Äôs challenges and some are secret challenges and/or feats that you can achieve with weapons, certain characters (who could have abilities) I‚Äôm just saying. This game is amazing, I‚Äôm playing it through right now and will do agai and again to waste time when I wanna kill stuff on the go! You guys made a great series and I think you can do it again even better! üòÅ also have some ideas on the game and it‚Äôs design and ideas for what to put in and love to have some input or at least a hearing.

"2326",454802329,"This game is one of my favorites, but it needs some upgrades. I think the f-15 Eagle, YF-23 Black Widow II, and the SU-50, should be added. If there's ever another good update, than that's what I want. I also think rortos should fix the f-35, because it‚Äôs way to fast and maneuverable when it gets to 150 knots. The f-35 shouldn‚Äôt have the exact same maneuverability as a harrier. Get good. Anyways, I think this game needs a major update that includes the things said above. If they don‚Äôt add at least one thing said above, then I won‚Äôt like this game as much as I do now, and I‚Äôll also drop two stars to make it two stars. So rortos, start working. üòâüëç"
"2327",454802329,"Great game, realistic and fun. You guys should make a Hot Shots/Firefighting version."
"2328",454802329,"I love this game very much but I have saw that‚Äôs this game need more support and need to fix ex. How a jet can‚Äôt reach 2000 kn impossible and pls add f-15 eagle , mirage 2000 , sab gripen , b51 , c 17 even more and more  thanks a lot Hamad"

"2342",455826958,"I have this application on my PS4 as well and just adore it. However the iOS version (at least for me) seems to slow down to a snail‚Äôs pace seemingly at random. I‚Äôve yet to find a solution to this as sometimes closing and reopening the app works, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Occasionally I‚Äôll be playing and I‚Äôll get a text. When this happens the game just slows way down. I tried updating the app and the tables but it says it‚Äôs all up to date. Very fun app as I really dig me some pinball and love all of these tables. This is just a tad frustrating."
"2343",455826958,"Pinball Arcade was amazing, you‚Äôd get to buy new tables ever few months and there was always something awesome to play.  Now, there hasn‚Äôt been anything new table wise in close to a year and old bugs haven‚Äôt been fixed in about that long.  I‚Äôve spent several hundred dollars on tables across all systems (iOS, switch, Xbox 360 and steam), I‚Äôm starting to worry that they might shut down the ability to download those tables."

I had to pay for the app and felt it was worth it but not any longer. Two stars. Ay even be too high but if they fix it I‚Äôll gladly change it to five stars."
"2368",458272450,"I like the site and everything but the app is terrible. Never keeps me logged in, I am always having to log in. Messages don‚Äôt update, I have to open them and close them several times before seeing the most recent message. Get message about unable to connect when I am on a steady internet connection or cellular data. Really frustrating."
"2369",458272450,"While providing a useful service the EH app is one of the worst app of its kind."
"2370",458272450,"I was exited to join this app. When I did i found that everyone I was being matched with never read my messages. So people that no longer use the service. Your lucky to have 2 people a week view your profile. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
"2371",458318329,"TV is not just TV. Every show we watch helps guide our minds. So, China limits access to certain content. This is good and bad for different reasons. Just as there are different seasons and a variety of teas... There‚Äôs different ways of influencing the minds of the masses. A VPN gives access to the world‚Äôs entertainment options, yet many shows are still unavailable - and leading streaming providers such as Netflix don‚Äôt operate in China (great fire wall paired with Chinese protectionist practices towards their larger companies - which are all controlled/unglued by the Chinese government). Because of this situation, this is one of the best APPs for watching English TV shows. All the best. LC"
"2372",458318329,"Paid for VIP , but not all shows can be watch!!!! Especially the one I am interested. We should able to watch everything, because we paid to watch, it‚Äôs not FREE!!!!"

"2387",459035295,"This game is fun, but it is very pay to play. If I were a dev I would take the coins off of the purchasing a player option. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to have to give up two forms of payment for a better team."
"2388",459035295,"Game was okay , I give it 2 star because the way the game was more like pay to win. You sacrifice too  much fund for a season to get all your player to be on top and then season end. New season start and now you have to start everything all over again, you can‚Äôt do much to upgrade the team because you sacrifice too much fund for the previous season, so now you have to start all over again to upgrade your team, it a waste of time or if you want to get them instant strong you need to pay more to get more token then you can upgrade your team to the strongest. So basically this game is like a pay to win, not a skill to win. If this game is a Skill to win then I would have rate it 5."

"2390",459189186,"I was really enjoying the game up until the prison safe puzzle with the green triangle. Unfortunately the ‚ÄúCheat Book‚Äù is no help and basically tells you that to move on you need a to solve the puzzle. I wish there was a way to bypass the puzzle or rest it to something else like the wiki suggests but even when I step out of the room or reset the game the puzzle is the same.  If a developer is reading this please help me out! I really want to continue playing this visually beautiful and plot based game!"
"2391",459189186,"This game has great graphics and I love the tone.  The puzzles were interesting and generally well done.  There are two main drawbacks for me.  First, I think the game is too short given it‚Äôs price.  Second, I think the hint system, which is crucial for a game like this, has a terrible flaw.  Generally I don‚Äôt care that you have to play a mini game to access the walkthrough.  The problem is that it shows you the walkthrough for the area you‚Äôre in, regardless of where you might be in the chain of puzzles.  So you might have access to 6 or 7 areas and not be sure where to go next.  You‚Äôll have to go to each area, play the mini game, and hope there‚Äôs something you can actually do there.  This also means that you will sometimes bypass the actual puzzle accidentally because the walkthrough for the area you‚Äôre in just has the final solution to another area‚Äôs puzzle."
"2392",459313476,"The flaw in this app is that it has Bb Major as having 3 flats WHEN THAT IS Eb MAJOR! I wonder what other flops does it have!"
"2393",459313476,"I really enjoy this app.  I have had it for around eight years and have been consistently satisfied with its performance.  I love how customizable it is so that any user can make meaningful progress.  I would like it if there were a chord progression ear training exercise, but otherwise I can‚Äôt think of any way this app could be better.  Excellent!"
"2394",459313476,"This app has not only helped me, an experienced piano player, but I have used it with my piano students for ear training and reading and it has helped them a lot. The only thing I think could improve the app was that if there was a teaching mode. For example, if someone doesn‚Äôt know what the Aeolian scale is, there could be a place in the app where they can go for a reference. Other than that, the app is simply a blessing. Thank you"
"2395",460177396,"Great app , very well functioning, easy to access and easy to create an account, they just spam too many emails so that‚Äôs why the y get a 4 star rating"
"2396",460177396,"If your into finds my quality content creators especially gaming Twitch is the place to be. The only thing that‚Äôs always driven me crazy to the point I almost gave only 4 stars is all the QUALITY broadcasters that are buried in such a saturated market. You must sift through hundreds to find a few hidden gems. ‚ÄúPartner‚Äù streams or ‚ÄúFeatured‚Äù channels have put in the grind and deserve it but some of these other upstarts have no prayer to cut through the noise. With that said the majority of people sitting through directories do not take the time to sift to the streams at the bottom with little to no views. I find that to be the Consoles (XBOX & PS4) fault for making it so ez for any toxic 12 year old with a console can connect and upload toxic trash. So considering at the end of the day it‚Äôs not all on Twitch? I went ahead with 5 stars for the app. good for tips, & tricks for any gamer and other IRL streams as Well."

Why doesn‚Äôt this app scan and automatically put in the right ‚ÄúGame‚Äù and why would you have an annual section where people can add in their seasonal purchases.   All this is, is a cute app to check your numbers. I can do that when I purchase at the store."

I have all notifications turned off except for the one team I‚Äôm interested in. Yet I get more notifications for other teams‚Äô games than I do for my own team. What‚Äôs the point of setting my notification preferences if I don‚Äôt get the ones I chose? This has been an ongoing problem with the app since the 2018/2019 season. Several updates have been released but that problem is still there. And before anyone asks, yes I am running the most current version of the app and iOS."

"2460",465694275,"I‚Äôm a huge fan of pinball, but specifically Zen Pinball! If you are a fan of pinball, then this is a must have app.  That said, I‚Äôm only able to give four stars because it appears that the tables I‚Äôve purchased on my Android device is not transferable to the iOS platform.  Is that the case?  Seems like if I‚Äôve purchased tables already, I should have to repurchase them on another platform."

Thank you I would like these changes!"
"2469",466965151,"I have always loved this game. Currently I switched phones from galaxy to iphone. However, anytime I try to send my Sims to work or school the app closes itself out. It's honestly annoying.

She‚Äôll sit there and get calls from Elmo and just chat and babble with him. It has really helped us, but I would LOVE to get all the calls, especially the ones that tell her it‚Äôs time to go potty or the other one telling her that she did a good job going on the potty! So please fix! Thank you!   I‚Äôll be happy to change rating to 5 stars once this issue is fixed, because she is infatuated with Elmo and his calls."

"2486",467953363,"The app works great. The main reason i bought it was for the deer activity by moon phases guide. I never pay enough attention to figure that stuff out on my own and this allows you to plan days off weeks in advance. Also, read the instructions. I didn't and found some of the stuff a little confusing so I emailed their support staff and they helped almost immediately, however all of the answers were in the instructions had i bothered to read them."

I purchased another app but my eyes glazed over just looking at it. Too complicated. I googled the issue again and found reference to a couple of HP apps - which I could not find in the App Store, but found this instead (a replacement?) Really strange because the first thing I ever tried was looking for an HP app and I couldn‚Äôt find anything, which is why I purchased the other app.   I installed this app, it found the two printers, I picked one, it already knew the file was 8.5 x 11, so the correct tray was selected, hit print, viola!  All done within a minute. Maybe two. This app is so awesome it almost makes me like the printers, which have been nothing but trouble connecting to them through WiFi on a computer. Maybe it‚Äôs because they are connected to a computer using windows? ; )"
"2505",469284907,"Deskjet 2600 series does not print well. Before i learned this i got hp to send me a replacement printer same model in hopes the print quality would improve.

Not formatted for iOS 13 which means you have to use touch screen controls. The buttons are designed for a mobile experience which means auto-shooting and auto-charging. Overall: This game has aged terribly.  This would be an amazing experience on the iPhone 3 or iPhone 4, but it is a laughable experience on The iPhone XS Max. However, they (Capcom) would have to rebuild the entire game from the ground up to make it comparable to the SNES version you remember which means it is not gonna happen."

This company has three apps that I use CONSTANTLY with my clients and this is one of then (I also loved the behavior management app when I was in the classroom).  I HIGHLY recommend this companies apps to both teachers and parents of students who are struggling in math.  I can't wait to see what they come out with next."

"2550",471458190,"This game suffers from two massive flaws:  1) There is a bug that lets you undo your turn in multiplayer (after you complete it). This means you can backtrack after a conflict.    2) You can not swap leaders, which removes an important strategy from our disposal.  The game can be great, but it needs a lot of polish. The art is mediocre. The developer seems to have abandoned it."

I‚Äôve never used Safari once in my entire life. But I use Chrome for normal stuff and I used this app for flash.   The rumors about flash crashing the iPad have never happened to me. It has been so smooth for the past 4 1/2 months I‚Äôve been using this site. I hated having to get my computer out just to play a flash game; I guess Apple has to give me something to hate again.

It only took about 2-3 hours to finish, but that was with reading fast and not waiting for the dialogue to finish. I would guess it is around 4 hours if you do auto mode or wait for the dialogue to finish.  Not much CG at all, but the story definitely makes up for it, and it is very touching indeed. I would highly recommend for a good read.  Now, I'm off to go find a planetarium and cry :)"

There is full Japanese voice acting and English text, but the graphics are mostly static with minimal animation. But what is great is that this is from the same company that made great visual novels such as Kanon and Clannad, so you get a great story and cute characters. You can put it into auto-play mode and it takes about 4 hours. There‚Äôs also a ‚ÄúNovel‚Äù mode where the text is shown full screen. I‚Äôm hoping that they will bring over more of their visual novels to iOS in English."

I had a request for the app and he got back to me in just a few hours. If you are looking for the most simple way to do much of the math required in a vacation ownership presentation, you have two options: another app that is much more expensive and performs a whopping three of the dozen or so calculations possible on this app. Or, you can do presentation mathematics, plug in your sales and find your VPG and closing ratio on the fly on a single screen, quickly and cleanly show what the mortgage will be and more. If you work in vacation ownership or timeshare, this app WILL be useful and helpful."

I like the simplicity of it, but wish that the documentation was a bit better and that updates were given a bit more frequently.  I do use the handwriting features, but find certain gestures to be enigmatic to the recognition engine.  One big suggestion I would give the developers would be to have a handwriting option that lets you notate an entire measure at a time and then click a button or move to the next measure before it‚Äôs interpreted.  I tend to write all my noteheads first, then the stems, then the beams, then the dots, and the engine starts recognizing what I‚Äôm writing too soon.  Also - a free-form handwritten staff would be VERY useful for jotting down notes and ideas without it being rendered into anything. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great little tool to have with me wherever I go."
"2600",475820434,"I was really enjoying this app, until I discovered that it lacked on of the most basic and necessary features - layers. Reading through their documentation I couldn‚Äôt find anyway to use multiple layers, a simple google search came up with the same results. Not having the ability to write for multiple voices for works such as a guitar part, or an orchestral piece where parts split.

"2658",479067148,"Do NOT waste your money. I just downloaded this game along with my boyfriend. Neither of our app works. The app closes as soon as it‚Äôs opened.

It also says to Check Internet connection (it is working fine on other devices). I cannot figure out how to ""earn"" marbles. I cannot figure out how to create a parent account/profile.  I am exasperated! I really want these apps to work, but they only partially work. Support is totally absent!"
"2663",479243891,"reviews here seem to be fake by the app developer's friends. useless app doesn't have any demo/free version and once purchased, there is no option to return it. The features are useless, not at all kid friendly. Stay away."

"2681",479889140,"This is the most powerful app I've ever used. I had a controlled lucid dream. I heard this app play sound in my sleep. This app works perfectly. When I was in hypnagogic state I did not hear sound play, but when I did go into REM sleep where I dreamed every time they played sound only in the REM sleep. When I was in a hypnagogic state again, I did not hear sounds, but when I went back into a REM state again when I was dreaming I did hear sound play again."
"2682",479889140,"This app is pretty fun. It‚Äôs interesting to see the sleep cycles. I am still working with the audio cue. When I‚Äôm actually I‚Äôm REM I never hear it. The few times I‚Äôve heard the cue I was already awake. Still playing with it."
"2683",479943969,"A little disappointed because the music does not play in the background and that‚Äôs a big part of the user experience especially when you paid for the app because the free version makes you get on WiFi. Disappointed."
"2684",479943969,"It‚Äôs 2019. Unless we‚Äôre being purists, why can‚Äôt this be full screen? And if we are being purists, at least fill the unused screen area with some artwork."

"2698",480375355,"Hi All,  This game is the greatest value out there. This is a great game and the originals make it even better.  Now, I know some people are going to gripe about the graphics in the bonus feature of the 1980s BT3.  What happened there is that the developers were porting the Apple 2 GS versions of the games (1 and 2) to the iPad.  There was no GS version of the Bards Tale 3, much to my disappointment back then.  Thus, they ported the Apple 2 plus/e/c version over.  So, Apple 2 owners have the authentic ports they had back then.  There was a better looking version of BT3 though - the Amiga version, but I have learned that it was buggy.   Thus, including the non-buggy version of BT3 was a good call, even with the low quality Apple II graphics.  (If you love the originals, the remastered versions for PC/PS/Xbox are practically perfect. There you can find pixel perfect graphics and a fantastic gaming experience.)  This iOS app is a 5 star game, no question."
"2699",480375355,"Wonderful game. Using a Nimbus and loving it!"

The Roku Chanel gives you over 1,000 free movie choices alone, then there are so many other free streaming Apps. Just pickum and load them up !

"2748",483336864,"This is useful and great! Thanks! All the features that is built in this is great!"
"2749",483353496,"TL;DR: Zero stars - Plays sound even when you turn sounds and music off in settings - Still forces you to watch ads after every other turn even though this is a paid app.   Full Review:  There is a front on the home screen that constantly says ‚Äúribbit‚Äù every two seconds. I turned off both the sounds and music in the settings but the front still makes noise. What‚Äôs the point of turning off all sounds if the frog is still going to make noise? It‚Äôs super annoying as the frog keeps making noise every other second and no way to turn it off. Further, and even more annoying, is that the click sounds when you tap icons still plays even though I have sounds turned off and the games still make noise and sound effects such as the frogs saying ribbit.  This app is absolutely unplayable when in an environment where you need to be quiet.  I wanted to contact customer support or email feedback directly to the developers instead of leaving a poor review but there was no contact information on the app.  Hopefully this gets fixed. I‚Äôll be sure to update this review if I hear anything back or the issue gets a fix.  Another issue is the fact that this is a PAID app. It costs $1.99 yet there are still ads! What did I just pay $2.00 for? The whole reason people pay upfront for apps is so they don‚Äôt have to watch ads! I‚Äôm not paying money to sit and watch ads or to have to pay even more money to get rid of them. Completely defeats the purpose of purchasing a paid app. If I wanted to watch ads there are plenty of FREE apps on the App Store that allow me to do so. Paying most of the FREE apps with an in app purchase of a couple dollars or less gets rid of ads completely so why is your app $2.00 with ads? No thanks!!   I very highly DO NOT recommend this app unless they make it fair and stop playing ads for an app that we already have to pay for in the first place."
"2750",483353496,"I paid for no ads option on my iPhone. I also downloaded the game on my iPad but it wanted me to pay again for no ads, and no restore purchase button to be found.  Tried tapping app support button and couldn‚Äôt find a way to leave a message. NOT HAPPY; wouldn‚Äôt have purchased the option if it doesn‚Äôt work on all devices!!"

"2752",483910781,"The reminders for vitamins and water and exercise. I like the database that builds up my food choices."

"2754",483910781,"Just missing the option to have recurring foods on select or all days and the Apple workouts tracking (other than walking). Otherwise great!"
"2755",484090401,"I was working on a very difficult character and clicked ‚Äúyes‚Äù at the end, in order to eliminate the character the stupid genie gave me, otherwise it would have come back over and over again and my character wouldn‚Äôt have ever been in play.  So, I clicked ‚Äúyes‚Äù only to find out it was some fictitious character and I was told I was being watched for cheating. SCREW THAT! This game is for fun. I wasn‚Äôt cheating! I was trying to eliminate a character so that I could try again and maybe the dumb bot could guess the person I was actually thinking of. The fact is, this genie is a process of elimination bot and it has become so vague that it‚Äôs not hard to fool the genie over and over again. Try playing for Clive Bundy. Good luck. (They‚Äôll fix this quickly I‚Äôm sure, but it was impossible to get the genie to guess him). This game used to be a fun way to pass mindless time, but they have gotten a little to big for their britches. If I have to worry about being called out as a cheater for something for which I neither pay nor use, you can keep your stupid app. I deleted mine and will not be downloading it on my children‚Äôs phone. Screw you Akinator. You can‚Äôt guess half my characters anyway and you treat your customers like crap. Good luck with your ridiculous app. I‚Äôm out! What a bunch of bot bull crap!"

It's important in learning the phonics associated with each letter and this application does a great job, in fact in may be one of the best for what it does. There are pre-defined spelling list but then you can also create your own. Most of the program is highly customizable which is often an issue with so many other apps. Kids are also rewarded with another fun side activity after completing a spelling test. The app was so great that I also bought the English version in order to practice our spelling words. Even though this app was made for kids, I also enjoy using it as well to work on my Spanish grammar. If you are learning Spanish it's a great app for your collection."

Then when I started playing it again, I found it wasn't the same as before. It was exactly the same, but every 30 seconds it crashed. I don't know what caused this issue, just because I hadn't played it for a long time, but I'm sure that wasn't the problem. They probably updated it and it made it glitchy, unless I was just out of space or somepthing. Great job overall... but pls fix the bug."

"2837",489479624,"As a caretaker of 3 Hatchis in this game, I have been willing to write a review on how good this app is.  Very educational; teaches kids how to care for a real pet. You feed, entertain, clean, and help your Hatchi in times is sickness. This all can be done for pets in the real world.  Also fun and addicting for everyone in general. Several games are included with a bonus game that consists of 10  levels. Games are simple, yet addicting. Some include Tic-Tac-Toe, Memory Matching, and Whack-A-Hatchi.  This game is triumphant, and I look forward to the bright future of this game."

I clicked everywhere on the map, nothing happened. Now I am stuck in the event card transaction with no way to get out of it except close the app and start a whole new game. Very frustrating."

Like in Fortnite they add a update every week when in Big win has not added any update in 2 years!!! Your game has 1 out of 10 rules in real baseball. NOTHING IN THIS GAME IS REALISTIC.

"2875",491998279,"Since downloading this app I have used it daily for articulation therapy at my school.  Gone are the days of pulling out different decks of cards, sorting them into initial/medial/final positions and finding their match for all the different students I work with throughout my day; all I have to do is go to one compact device (my iPad) and use this app that has it all and more!   To have all sounds available in all positions of words at the word, carrier phrase, sentence, and reading levels helps manage my office of clutter and simplifies the work space for the students. I am hoping the developers will add the phonemic /r/ sounds (ar, air, ire, or, er) in all word positions to be targeted at the word, carrier phrase, sentence, and reading levels as well.  But, the app does allow the user to add your own pictures for target words individualized to the student(s) so I could create my own phonemic /r/ lists/pictures this way but for now I don‚Äôt have the time and I‚Äôll keep my fingers crossed they get to it first!    The app allows to easily create groups with each student focusing on their own sound(s) in various position(s) and level(s) to individualize each student‚Äôs needs to work on their own goals at their own pace.    One of my favorite features is the audio record and playback feature.  It has already proven effective with my students who typically have difficulty with self-monitoring skills.  My students are recognizing hearing themselves say the words incorrectly and are now self-monitoring their sounds better!    Lastly, not only does the app have articulation targets but they also have all of the phonological processes to target at the word level as well.  I am hoping levels for the carrier phrase and sentence levels for each to become available for students working through increasing the complexity of their speech while targeting phonological processes as well."
"2876",491998279,"I purchased this app to help my daughter with her speech during a time when our insurance did not cover speech therapy. The app is excellent! It is very user friendly and my daughter loves doing it. I love that you can specify which sounds you can work on. I also love that you can record your child‚Äôs pronunciation. I would recommend this app to parents that want some extra practice for their child. A+++"

"2884",492502649,"this is absolutely useless, i bought it thinking i could get a cape but turns out it doesn‚Äôt work. i want my money back."
"2885",492502649,"Don‚Äôt buy this app, it only lets you create capes but you can‚Äôt upload them."
"2886",492502649,"This game is not that good I can‚Äôt share my cape with my friend nor put the cape on Minecraft the buttons don‚Äôt work please fix this game this is a waste of money"
"2887",492671847,"reviews are horrid.  I don't listen --- I'll give it a whirl and holla back"
"2888",492671847,"It is so lame. Whenever you press the screen once while the app is running, it just brings you back to the home menu. I wish I could rate this app 0 stars but there is no way to do that."
"2889",492671847,"Errors, uncertain controls, ads... Worth a try perhaps but not worth keeping. 2 stars for not totally sucking."
"2890",493136154,"I use a few different apps (OmniFocus, Things) for managing lists, work tasks and projects, however Clear is my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù app for quickly dictating a list under a variety of topics from projects, groceries, journaling, trips, ideas, etc. I love its simple & quick interface, unlike others that are more complex, yet also helpful for different reasons. The simple joy of sliding items completed off the list in Clear feels great."
"2891",493136154,"I love this app.  It‚Äôs fast and responsive. It‚Äôs very simple to use and has a very attractive design.  It has fun sounds too.  It doesn‚Äôt have complex features like recurring tasks and scheduling.  I use another app for my more complex needs, but when I want to get things done today, I use Clear.  It‚Äôs just a cool simple ‚Äúto do‚Äù app, which is exactly what I want!  You can have multiple lists, which is nice. Also, it does sync nicely between my MacBook,  iPhone and iPad.  I highly recommend it.  My past problem with Clear:   I wrote a 1 star review in January of 2017 titled ‚ÄúLast update 2015, not syncing.‚Äù  That‚Äôs a long time not to update an app, so I‚Äôm concerned they might stop updating the app again.  Since it wasn‚Äôt working back then, I uninstalled the app.  At the time I was very disappointed in Clear‚Äôs app developer and felt that I had wasted my money.  But wait the story has a happy ending.  Re-discovery:  Recently I was searching for a new ‚Äúto do‚Äù app and I was surprised to see Clear and that it was being updated.  I immediately downloaded it and am using it daily...and loving it."
"2892",493136154,"This is by far my most used app for iPhone. I‚Äôve been using this app as my to do app for over 4 years now. Its simply the most elegant and simple app to use. I know it‚Äôs a big task to take on for little reward but I wish the developers would rewrite the code for the Apple Watch. Having this simple powerful tool on the wrist would be a huge game changer for me."
"2893",493145008,"I used to really like this app, but the more I use it, the more difficult it is to use the app. I keep getting messages that it looks like I‚Äôm offline, when I‚Äôm absolutely online, and it‚Äôs frustrating. I paid for a whole year, and it‚Äôs worthless now. Like they got my money and it isn‚Äôt functioning now."
"2894",493145008,"So grateful that Headspace supports educators. My days are so stressful and this app has been helping me become more mindful, and take the time I need for myself. Great intro course. The graphics are beautiful, and it‚Äôs very easy to navigate!"
"2895",493145008,"Worth the money. Audio has trouble when using some Bluetooth speakers, but it‚Äôs an acceptable annoyance when considering how great the app is overall. Went from occasionally meditating for 5-10mins a couple times a week to an active 7 days a week for 20mins."
"2896",493226494,"I used to use this app when it was free it was fun but i have to get premium to use the once free app its BS"
"2897",493226494,"Next time, when you offer a F R E E app, make sure it‚Äôs exactly that. F R E E. This force pay crap is ridiculous."
"2898",493226494,"Well I don‚Äôt know how the game works but I thought it was going to be free and some parts need to be paid for.I‚Äôm not going to pay that much money for a music app.I don‚Äôt think this is a mistake that only I made,but I got kinda sad because I was really looking forward to the app.But I‚Äôm almost certain that the app is REALLY good to charge so much money."
"2899",493536432,"App will not be compatible with future versions of iOS. Is it possible you can update the app?"
"2900",493536432,"Probably will not work on iOS 11 or future hardware."
"2901",493536432,"This game is very polished in terms of presentation - graphics, sound, guidance, mood.  The concept itself is largely mundane. Some levels are mildly amusing, many are simple exercises in chaos, chance, and opportunity.  I played through 30 levels or so which was more than enough. For five minutes you think ""cool!"" after which you are done."
"2902",493849232,"All those trucks are really amazing but can you add more vehicles to the game please otherwise it‚Äôs a really good game I love it"
"2903",493849232,"Y‚Äôall need more equipment and better quality need variety of trucks & trailers more semi trucks bigger dozers and cranes more maps a run way with one little jet and new boats every thing that is on the game already is great but it‚Äôs a little old need update very very soon before more and more people stop playing it"
"2904",493849232,"Well I love the game but we need a new update with new machines like a motor-grader, more semis and skid steers!!!"
"2905",493912733,"Amazing App!!"
"2906",493912733,"Adrian, your app has inspired me to get back into the fitness I love to do daily every week, including working on my abdominals!!  I cannot wait to see my results in a few short weeks after Week 8!  Thank you for creating this app for not just me, but for the fellow people of this world to try and use.  You‚Äôre a wonderful instructor!!!üí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèº"
"2907",493912733,"Hi Adrian  It's really cool one beyond cuz make me to workout after a really really long time , glad to meet it and thanks to you , I'm also in week 4 of challenge I am working on it."
"2908",494302506,"It‚Äôs a waste of money I bought this game so I can play a board game I like online but I can‚Äôt find an online game idk if it‚Äôs Bc no one plays it or if it‚Äôs a bug but if your buying this to play with real people dont buy it üò¢I want my money back"
"2909",494302506,"The game, and the implementation, is fine. However, the best, BEST part of playing Scotland Yard is always the after-game, when you all burst out talking about how close you were back on move 20, where were you, oh my gosh I thought you had me, etc.  I'm surprised that zero thought was put into this critical part of the experience. You can't even look at the board after the game ends and they tell you Mr. X's final position. It just exits out and is lost forever.  Devs, if you are reading, I highly suggest you implement the ability to recap - you already have the turn counter at the bottom of the board. After a game ends, please let players tap on each turn marker and see where the pawns were at that point. It seems like that would be easy."
"2910",494302506,"I stumbled on this older game and gave it a try.  Enjoyed the simple rapid play against the AI, and wanted to try against friends and family on separate devices.  No can do.  When you select Bluetooth (which should also have a Wi-Fi option), it says to first select the number of players and then press ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù.  But there are no buttons to select the number of players.  If I go ahead and just press Connect it spins looking for a device, but it never finds one - even though a Bluetooth iPad was just a couple feet away.  OK...I then tried the Internet option.  Selected the name of a Game Center friend to play 2 player game with.  Their device was on and open in my house.  Again it just spun and never connected.  I suspect that since they used Game Center for the connection, they may not have kept up with the protocol for the new Game Center...or maybe this method cannot even be used anymore.  Too bad...hope they fix it.  Will give 5 stars if they can, because it would be fun to play with family and friends."

"2912",494407419,"This is a cool idea but the questions repeat themselves over and over again and it gets really annoying and boring. They need variety and/or someone to put more questions in."

"2920",495077699,"This app keeps crashing in the middle of a game. Please fix his because we used to love this app."
"2921",495077699,"Cant even play the game cause it keeps crashes"
"2922",495077699,"I like it but it is a little boring"
"2923",495546638,"I love the style of the app. Feels like you‚Äôve got the real instruments in your hand. So many other apps have gone to a flat style. But I really enjoy the 3D visual feel of iPhone app like this."
"2924",495546638,"In your latest update v 5.1 on Jan 9, 2018 still this app crashed and never open in iOS 10 and above in iPhone 5 and iPad, may be bug which needs to be fixed. Thanks  About one week passed, nothing changed regarding my previous review, as this app immediately crashed. Will you make forthcoming update to solve this problem. Thanks  More than 3 months passed still no response to my previous review and this app is crashed immediately after open Thanks Long time passed since previous reviews and no action was done to correct the immediate crash when trying to open this app!!!"
"2925",495546638,"I just download this application and it‚Äôs not work with me directly off when I open it ?? I used iPhone Xs Max ."
"2926",495583717,"There are two apps I use more than others, this one when starts glitching I have to shut the the app down or reboot the iPad. I‚Äôm about to try another app out because it is so frustrating sometimes."
"2927",495583717,"Approximately 5-7 times a week the puzzle locks up in such a way that you can‚Äôt scatter or zoom and the background is black and can‚Äôt be changed. Otherwise, good fun."
"2928",495583717,"I have looked all over for a way to contact the developers about this app not loading, but there isn‚Äôt a way to.  This was my favorite way to relax, I would play every morning. Over the past several weeks, it would periodically freeze when loading an ad. I would need to shut down and reload the app. But for the past week, the app won‚Äôt even open. I haven‚Äôt been able to use it all week. Before these issues, it was fun, had vibrant colors and worked well."
"2929",495680460,"Love it üòç"
"2930",495680460,"Some of you really need to read the app description. There are people whining and asking for their money back because they thought it was a Toca Life game. Obviously, if you took a little more time to look at the app‚Äôs description, you would see that it wasn‚Äôt (you should know based on the title‚Äîevery app in the Toca Life series has ‚ÄúToca Life: ____‚Äù as the title). This is an amazing game for 2-6 year olds, and there are 8-10 year olds whining about how ‚Äústupid‚Äù and ‚Äúboring‚Äù the game was. I mean, if you‚Äôre a parent and your 2-6 year old actually found it boring, that‚Äôs fine. But it annoys me that people way outside the targeted age group are giving this terrible reviews when they should‚Äôve read the description more carefully. I‚Äôm 12, btw, and I loved to play this when I was like 4-7 :D"
"2931",495680460,"I bought this game back when it first came out (2012ish?) and it was great! But I think it needs updated because it‚Äôs rather dull now and kids are getting bored with it. It‚Äôs still a great game, but it clearly needs updated."
"2932",496177674,"Thank you to the creators of this miracle app!! I usually never write reviews but I was soo happy to find an app that can help me so much! I‚Äôm in nursing school and I have ALOT of reading to do in such a short span. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I was going to read all of those chapters, plus do my homework and go to work all at the same time. I was starting to fall behind of my readings but thanks to this app, I was able to catch up on 5 out of 9 chapters in about a day, all while managing to keep everything else in my life on track. Not only did I not have to physically read the book myself cause the app is reading for me, but I actually retain a lot more information through this. I would usually take half a day just to read one chapter due to boredom, tiredness or just busy with other stuff, so I am very excited to use this while I‚Äôm in school. Thank you so much!"
"2933",496177674,"Ok i love this app so much and means so so much to me but lately it hasnt been reading words in qoutes, so i might have something that say  (the perspetive that someone is ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù or ‚Äúlow,‚Äù functioning is.....)and the app ends up reading it as  reading  it as ( the perspective that someone is   To the power of  pr to the power of functioning is......)  which becmes extremely prob,ematic for being abke to understand whzt my artcle is axtually saying"
"2934",496177674,"Very poor support! Hard to follow and use. Would not recommend this product waste of money. Again very hade to work!"
"2935",496191902,"It‚Äôs fun to play and occupies time but you cannot get the sprinter challenge. It is impossible to achieve. Very frustrating."
"2936",496191902,"I played the computer one a long time ago but now I love it on mobile I mean right now I got 9853.51 m and a whopping $16,457.00 . Now I know some of you are probably gonna complain about my review or make some remarks but if not thank you for not I guess. Anyway I got sidetracked , I like this game and thank you for making it on mobile"
"2937",496191902,"Great game but the wind stream mechanic (that you claim gives you time to avoid) has no indication of when and where it‚Äôs going to happen. And I‚Äôm tired of getting grows where I literally go 5m/s the entire time with a fully upgraded plane. It‚Äôs irritating as all can be. Make it so it takes a lesser percentage of your speed or make it so the ‚Äúwind sock‚Äù I purchased actually works and appears."
"2938",496218553,"I had this game once I really just ignored it I didn‚Äôt really like it last time so I gave up on it but what would happen if I just got it back it has been awhile so I forgot what it is like"
"2939",496218553,"Some issues I have to report. The music?! I am so sorry. That‚Äôs the bad stuff. Good stuff is the letters!"
"2940",496218553,"I got this app on my mom‚Äôs phone,I was thinking that it was the app that wasn‚Äôt free,When I got the app it was boring,Then I deleted it because it was boring,PowerpuffG1,"
"2941",496438671,"This is one of my favorite games. Perhaps u could add a freshwater spot. Also, make this game more realistic (jumping fish, better graphics, bait instead of lures, etc.). Also, the day I wrote this review, I caught a lot of fish, including Red Snapper, Red and Gag Grouper, a Mangrove Snapper, and even an octopus! Fishing‚Äôs my favorite sport, by the way. And one more thing, please decrease line tension to make the game more realistic."
"2942",496438671,"Developers,,,imagine if you could develop a game you could be proud of instead of a slot machine disguised as a game....  This free2play Is a cancer to all gamers and makes developers  No different then telemarketers... ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë"
"2943",496438671,"Horrible"
"2944",496499395,"I bought the premium thinking that I could actually play two player on WiFi but instead no matter what I do it will not connect and I wasted my money spending it on this app. Fix this or take the app of the store because it‚Äôs just a scam as of now."
"2945",496499395,"I bought it and could only play with me after t didn‚Äôt find a partner"
"2946",496499395,"The feature that you paid for to play with other players doesn‚Äôt work. App developers need to fix it or credit people their money back."
"2947",497595276,"I like it BUT it disconnects from server ALOT!!! Every 5 minutes"
"2948",497595276,"This is such a fun game!"
"2949",497595276,"Amazing game.... but.... I would like to be able to turn the buildings all the way around.... it‚Äôll be nice... ( oh and a plus! They saved my progress from like years ago... THANK! :D)"
"2950",497716362,"Like the camera, tuners as a separate gadget are now obsolete.   TE is very easy to use, and has incredible flexibility regarding tuning systems, how narrow a band you want to consider in tune.  The metronome also works great.   The APP can also generate a drone for practicing, and has a wealth of other features for advanced users."
"2951",497716362,"I think this is good but I think it's out of tune because I play the notes correctly but it says I'm playing like an A flat when I'm playing a G flat"
"2952",497716362,"Tonal energy is an extremely useful tool for anyone studying music. It has multiple settings for tuning. It can transpose for you in any key or based on the instrument. It has specific settings for accurate tuning for voice, wind or string instruments. It has a drone feature where it will match the exact pitch you are trying to play. It also has a metronome with precision and subdivision. It‚Äôs very user friendly. I‚Äôve had it for less than two weeks, and it has my highest recommendation."
"2953",497788271,"Got this game thinking that it would be like like Tetris for the NES but it was disappointing."
"2954",497788271,"I can‚Äôt through a game without it crashing...sad this was my favorite game."
"2955",497788271,"Overall awesome Teri‚Äôs. It every time I get to level 9 the game shuts down.  Every single time.  Fix his please."
"2956",497880658,"Amazing app granted and beloved by the sneaker community which is why I definitely paid for it but annoying big issue on some notifications that keeps popping up for just one notification, basically repeating itself so many times literally had the same exact notification around 18-20 times and screenshot it for their records"
"2957",497880658,"The best sneaker app ever I have copped 90% of my collection thanks to J23"
"2958",497880658,"Missing the restock updates. Not getting the notifications but news page is getting updates. If i need to open the app all the time to see updates then whats the point!  Update- this app is waste of money!. Never sends notifications. Whats the point of having an app which i need to open constantly to see the updates. Wish i could give zero star!!!"
"2959",497933996,"I‚Äôve been playing this game for years and it still is so much fun, but I would really enjoy it more with my new phone if it offered support for it. Please!!"
"2960",497933996,"I love this game but don‚Äôt try to use it to relax. They also make another bird shooting pumpkin game but I can‚Äôt find it in this App Store sadly enough."
"2961",497933996,"Always fun!"
"2962",497936366,"Yup. You read that correctly. It‚Äôs what I feel when toppling these ridiculous knights off of their lame wooden structures, and my god, it‚Äôs amazing. I just used the magic to receive all the badges on Level 1 and it was glorious. Catapult King should be an animated cartoon. That‚Äôs how good it is. Plus, you can try different angles to demolish their structures for fun."
"2963",497936366,"I bought this game several years ago and played through all of the levels. Every so often I come back to it and play through again. Amazing art work with so much detail. The physics engine is effective and comically rewarding as you watch those obnoxious little knights fly, flip and topple over. Great fun!"

"2970",499289888,"Very enjoyable app, with the possible exception of my not being able to figure out how to make the infamous 7-10 split, which I did once in real ten pins in the 50 years I‚Äôve been a bowler. One programming request here?  The next time you revise or update the app, how about considering incorporating a circle around the first number in the frame, like its done in actual bowling score keeping?  The game does incorporate lots of sloppy strikes when you put a spin on the ball and you‚Äôre near the pocket, which is also very realistic. Great game y‚Äôall, my second favorite game app, the first being classic hearts."

The interface is clean and simple.  I very much like the feature that allows deleting or renaming videos while browsing the file list.  I appreciate that they implemented one of my suggestions in the latest version."
"2973",499470113,"I painstaking moved all my files into this app because it has a password protection feature. However, I opened the files app native to iOS and found that I could see all the files in this app within the iOS files app. I could zoom in on the files view and read info on the first pdf pages. I thought that was all but, to my horror, I was able to completely open all the files on the app if I tapped on them and then tapped on the bottom of the screen after the blank page came up. I ONLY got this app for the password feature which is totally defeated with the files app. Also, you might think ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just delete the iOS files app. Well it is easily re-downloaded and reintegrated with FileExplorer by anyone who has access to your phone. This is even if you log out of iTunes."

"2977",500098096,"I‚Äôve never been a fan of touch controls, but the devs have made this game very accessible. There are some parts where the controls will be clunky and may waste a turn for you, and the ‚Äúcontinue: Okay/cancel ‚Äú was super confusing at first so I dropped a star. Otherwise the game is fantastic and worth buying."
"2978",500098096,"Porting this to touch screen has made the game incredibly clumsy to play, and has even made some ‚Äòtactics‚Äô impossible.   Also, it‚Äôll just crash out of the blue, which is suuuuuper frustrating when you‚Äôre in the middle of a long battle, or have just finished customizing some of your characters.  I love this game, and it brings back so many good memories, but this is driving me nuts, and I‚Äôm regretting paying for it."

THIS APP IS UNSTABLE!!!!!!. $30!?!?!!!, wow is right.   For $30, at least give us the ability to format a document as two columns, show actual document borders or preview PDF so we can know how lyrics will look before printing, exporting, switching apps, then viewing exported file. This export workflow feels clunky.   Also have a presentation mode so that we can just view lyrics and not have menus taking up space.   Also, please give us the ability to save styles and apply them right on a working document without having to go to a song that is already formatted, then having to apply formatting from there. This seems counter-intuitive.  App appears dated, visually. Very pricey app for having it missing really essential functions. How long before an update?  Still no timeframe."

This app not only makes an extremely obtuse and non intuitive topic accessible, it also manages to make it enjoyable and...dare I say it: FUN !   I have shared this app with my nephews and nieces AND their children (some as young as 5 years old) and it has always elicited excitement, curiosity and many, many questions. It will be interesting to see how their very early exposure to easily accessible and yet extremely abstract concepts affects their abilities to process and assimilate abstract and obtuse ideas going forward (or, in this instance, rotating outward and folding up...).  I do, however, have one suggestion...although the two pages where you ‚Äòhack‚Äô the optic chiasma (meld two images into a ‚Äú3-D‚Äù facsimile) work fine on my iPhone and my iPad Mini they don‚Äôt do well on standard sized iPads. My arms, and I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù tall, are too short to hold the screen far enough away to fix and hold the images in place while manipulating the conjoined image.

Like an addict I had reached my bottom and was searching for anything that could help. I came across this app VGB and decided to give it a try. Almost immediately I noticed changes in my eating...smaller bites, really tasting my food and craving fruit!! This Is my 4th week and I‚Äôm down 15 lbs!!! I am a true believer. I love this program and how easy it‚Äôs been. If you want to lose weight or are feeling out of control with food please give this program a try!"
"3036",504835984,"I came across easyloss purely by accident, but after reading all of the reviews I could find...decided I had to dl it.  As someone who has been on pretty much every type of diet there is out there, this is a breath of fresh air because it ISNT a diet.  It gives you so much hope (and results!); you don't have to change your entire life to fit the confines of the latest fad diet...you just follow the guidelines.  The guidelines teach you to listen to your own body, and eat intuitively.  I honestly haven't changed what I'm eating at all, though I now don't have binge sessions, so I'm actually eating a lot less without any feelings of hunger or deprivation.  It's so simple, and yet our own  ability to eat intuitively has basically been programmed out of us!    The hypnosis sessions help to support your own resolve, and they really are great.  I've been able to lose 12lbs in 4 weeks...which is huge because usually I'll drop like 10lbs in 2 weeks on a proper ""diet"" and then fall off in some way (large or small) because I'm ravenous and cranky.  Because this isn't a diet, and you aren't restricting yourself, you don't get those feelings and it's so much easier to push on.  Instead of a big drop on the scale (water weight), my weight goes down a little bit on most days for a nice cumulative downward movement on the scale.  It's amazing!    I will say that when you read the guidelines you may think..""this is it?"" ...well, yes, that IS it!  And then you'll realize as you continue eating, knowing the guidelines, just how much you've been overdoing it.  Eating just because it's x-o'clock and everyone else wants to eat, or eating a massive serving of food just because it's on your plate and then wanting to unbutton your pants or something crazy.  Try this, it works.  And it will give you your life back when it comes to food.  No more obsessive tracking or controlling the macro content of your meals, etc.  just eating how we were designed to eat...with these lovely folks helping you along the way with the hypnosis sessions and Facebook group."

"3100",510461370,"Update 5: It is the worst when a great game is created by a terrible company. This game hasn't been updated in 8 months and is falling apart... server crashes, load times, ugh. Not to mention, it isn't a fair play game. Despite buying the game, it is dominated by those who pay more for turbo bikes. Im at a stall at level 4 because they often only do a single 4 star race per day and it is open bike meaning it gets dominated by paid for turbo bikes. They could easily add more 4-star bike specific races so it is talent, not money that wins...    Update 4: I really want to remove a star, but I will keep it at two because they did start releasing more ‚Äúkickass‚Äù bike parts which is the only way to upgrade from level 2 to 3. The reason for the update is Duel is now completely broken. Before it had issues matching with 1 out of 5 attempts working, which is still the problem, but now, when a race is finished, it doesn‚Äôt connect to server so just deletes the race... super frustrating especially because challenges are duels.  Update 3: I just upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars because they started adding more of the bike that upgrades level 2 bikes to level 3 bikes... after months of being stalled, I get to progress again üòÄ However, connectivity issues are seeming to get worse. Duel only matches ever 4th or 5th attempt and matchups tend to be very imbalanced. Also Tourneys often get server down issues... it seems the game is getting more popular, but their servers cant handle it.  Update 2: now tournaments is failing to record some of my times so I come in last. Either the game has developed serious bugs or <enter conspiracy theory here>. I did get a response from support who invited me to delete the game... are you kidding me?!? üò°  Update 1: now game has serious server issues with regular connection issues and duel matching just completely fell off. I will be happy when another company takes this concept and builds a better game. ‚Äî  Original: First off, this is an incredible game. Ive even built my own tracks online... here is the MAJOR problem that makes it soooo frustrating. First, I paid for the game, yet players can still spend more to get a bike that is unbeatable... learn from other games, let spending be vanity not performance... people lose interest after buying anyways because there is no more challenge. Next and probably the worst is you can get all first level bikes in a couple hours, second level bikes in a couple days, but 3rd level bike near impossible (been playing everyday for months) because they hold back the one bike needed to upgrade any level 2 bikes so all progress completely halts and all rewards in tourneys become useless... DONT PREVENT PROGRESS DUMB DUMBS, again monetize on vanity or secret unlocks, not performance or progress, you wreck the game. Finally, to make it even harder to unlock their rare-as-a-diamond-in-the-butt-crack-of-an-elephant bike is the fact that higher level bikes can compete in lower level races... this means the entire progress bar skews to the already haves instead of leveling the field... not very smart. I have written the devs regarding this issue but crickets..."
"3101",510461370,"I‚Äôm sorry but as fun as this game is to play, they NEED to get new levels put in this game. Also is is insane how long it takes to level up to a bike that has 4 or 5 stars? And now with the VIP like What the heck that‚Äôs too expensive. NEED MORE LEVELS and where are the user designed levels there are never any there anymore!!"
"3102",510461370,"Well, I think this game is really great as far as mechanics level design and bike options etc. Multiplayer is a great touch as well. I even like pd it so much I got BikeRacePro pro. However this all changed with the introduction of bikerace VIP. For me personally 100$ is way to much even for a paid app. I find it very bothersome that I‚Äôm no longer able to use any other bikes but the default one. This wasn‚Äôt always the case. I almost had all bikes unlocked except the few ones that were only paid. Which I was fine with. But for me a reason I liked playing was completing the challenges that were needed to unlock the next bike in the line. And I don‚Äôt know how often review are read and if at least some changes will be made but in all the years of having had this app it would be wonderful to be able to unlock some bikes.   -Thank you."

"3165",516875543,"Listen, your game is great. I love the gameplay and the controls are easy and simple. Yet, I hate this game more than any other in the whole wide world! Why? Because some of the levels are so demanding and are almost impossible. I‚Äôm not saying you should change the entire game, but certain levels should be given a few more seconds for all 3 stars. Nonetheless, I think it is a great game. Still, somehow this game is more frustrating than ‚Äúgetting over it‚Äù."
"3166",517260318,"Another Update: Why do I botherüôÑ You‚Äôve rigged the game..made it incredibly stressful..not relaxing and enjoyable. I‚Äôve given you time to change things and you choose not to so I want to warn others and let you know how unenjoyable you have made one of my favorite games. This bad review is on you. I don‚Äôt want to try anymore. UPDATE: I reloaded this game and I‚Äôm regretting it already. IF you would make it to where you can turn OFF the timer I could enjoy your games..please make it possible. Also. I would love to give this 5 stars except for the fact that I notice how you have ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the game and you deliberately make it stressful and pretty much unwinable. Too many examples to cite here. I don‚Äôt want to delete it but I‚Äôm not enjoying the stress, especially when you change the board to make sure that I don‚Äôt have a match.  I love the butterfly game....but it's not fair or fun to have the spider grab your butterfly if there is still a play going...xplosions all over the place..and your ""stratigic"" move is wasted when the spider takes a butterfly DURING a play. I am not a sore loser...I have scored many games near the 750,000- 2 million points. It would also be good to have something saved to help blast your way out when you are in real danger. I do love the game tho...and always hate spiders!"

There are some pretty major problems with it. First off, I can never get the light to work properly. If I turn on the flash option in the main settings and hit save, it doesn‚Äôt. It immediately removes anything that I have chosen. It also doesn‚Äôt work if I go into the gun settings. The only way for me to get it to work is to refresh the app with each new gun that I choose, which gets annoying. My second issue is that the bomb that you can put a timer on (which is a great concept, by the way. We need more bombs!) sometimes just freezes. It counts down, and then randomly just stops. No explosions, no beeping sound of the counter. Nothing. Very frustrating. If this can get fixed, I‚Äôll change my rating, but this game was last updated three years ago so... anyways, I want my money back. This was not worth it at all.

First of all the anvil has problems. If you put hammers and broken equipment in it it won‚Äôt repair them and instead cause them to disappear.

"3232",521577043,"This is a very comprehensive App and the learning curve is quite bumpy at the beginning because some of the features are not user friendly at all. You will have to devote some time to learn if you want to get the most of it.   This App has one major flaw, entering a new wine is a very complicated and time consuming thing. You cannot scan the wine front label nor the bar code like Vivino does. That leaves you with the only option to use the search option to find the wine that you want to add. The search icon to access the database to find your wine is on the top right and not in the main data entry area. When you start entering your wine most of the options that come up don‚Äôt have the correct harvest year of your wine specially if it is an international wine or if it is a recent harvest from 2016-2018. You have no other option to select the closest option and then change the year manually.   Furthermore you have to manually take picture of  the label of your wine bottles, because the database does not include a picture. The App allows you to enter up to 3 pictures but you have to take those pictures manually to each bottle during the adding wine process. The other day it took me almost an hour to enter into the App a full case of 12 bottles, after navigating to find the correct year of my wines and taking manual pictures of all my wines.   Adding the option of scanning the wine label or the bar code to quickly locate your wine like Vivino does is an absolute must. If they don‚Äôt do it the App is too much time consuming and will require a lot of time to perform the most basic thing which is adding a new wine."
"3233",521577043,"It‚Äôs a great app overall, but I was very disappointed on the lack of information for the different Champagne sub regions.

"3293",525195399,"It said when I downloaded the game I could translate it to English but I can‚Äôt find out how too in the game could you please make it easier wot people who speak English to find how to switch it"
"3294",525195399,"Great game, great app... you can sort of figure it out without knowing Japanese, but English would be helpful."
"3295",525246631,"I used to play these games all the time when I was younger. The graphics are really nostalgic to me. I‚Äôm glad a few of these are still here but please pleass PLEASE bring back breakfast maker, s‚Äômores maker, snowman maker, and all your other ‚Äúmaker games‚Äù, but especially breakfast maker! Please... I love that game and I wish to purchase all the items on that game. Please!!! Update: PLEASE BRING BACK ICEE ARCADE AND ICEE MAKER TOO I BEG YOU!"
"3296",525246631,"I remember when i first got this game i was like 4 or 5 it‚Äôs was one of my favorite games ever and i like forgot about it but i ran into i and i‚Äôm so happy i found this game again i hope you other people have/had a good time with this game like i did"
"3297",525246631,"I rember this game I would play it as a 5 year old and I totally forgot aboute it!! I  downloaded it again and it brings back so many memories!"
"3298",525507410,"My nephew LOVES this app and my niece is already showing interest even though it‚Äôs not potty training time for her yet :)"
"3299",525507410,"This used to be one of our favorites but then came the update...  The new update:  -removed the ‚Äújust watch‚Äù option which my infant loved. Why remove?  My LO (little one) would be hypnotized they the whole thing. Now she just gets stuck and bored.  -removed fun phrases like ‚ÄúElmo knows what to do‚Äù, random flushes, Elmo laughing, Star sounds and more.  -Re-recorded phrases using a seeming ‚Äúdrugged up‚Äù super slow Elmo. Happy Elmo was far superior! -added a female character which is blends in very poorly. It‚Äôs like someone shouting during your favorite song and ruining it. How about her own pages instead of sloppily throwing her in?  In summary, I wish so much I didn‚Äôt update. Unfortunately Apple gives no option to roll back or money back when the product is negatively changed."
"3300",525507410,"I realize it just a few dollars but it really wasn‚Äôt worth it for me. It got my son to sit on the potty to play it but there isn‚Äôt a lot to do. He got bored with it very fast."

"3305",525790167,"Like the app"
"3306",525790167,"Doesn‚Äôt even give you the full view"
"3307",525818572,"I first saw this and thought it would a fun thing to do while at work. Awesome concept. However, it gives inaccurate achievements. So until that is fixed, I won't use it."
"3308",525818572,"Nice improvements. Finally works right."
"3309",525818572,"Please update to make the app function properly in background. Please allow for 1.5 and 2.0 pay for overtime. I poop a lot on overtime. Great app."

"3311",525818839,"I used to play plague inc. all the time, with my friends, cousins, and siblings, but then DLC‚Äôs came out, and the original game modes died, I still play it now but it changed too much."
"3312",525818839,"It took about ten tries to figure out the balance. At first I couldn't get past the cure being developed and implemented. Then I made the virus too deadly too fast and it wiped out all of my infected before contaminating the whole world. Then I figured out the timing of all of the various triggers and realized that once you win - replay is just a variation on a theme with little to maintain long term interest. Worth the price but definitely not a five star game."
"3313",525929300,"Let me start off by telling you that this game is utter perfection. The dynamics are so on and the physics is right which makes it so much fun to play. The ONLY complaint I have is when the diver is doing a type of backwards flip (reverse, back) when you switch from doing a backwards pike to a backwards somersault the guy glitches, he starts in a different position than where you left off on the previous flip and its not smooth. I know this is fixable because when you are doing a forwards dive, it works perfectly. If you could please take a look at this I will surely be buying much more from you guys! Thanks!"
"3314",525929300,"Best game I‚Äôve ever played, super fun and interesting!! There‚Äôs only one problem, there should really be a female diver, only reason it‚Äôs not 5 stars."
"3315",525929300,"A really cool game, but I‚Äôd love the option to have a female diver, as well as a slower twist maybe."
"3316",526011730,"This game is scary I told Angela if there was something in her eyes she said r u alone and I said just 2 people and I was with my 5 friends and my phone frozen and I got a virus.I deleted it and reinstalled it and I pressed on Tom and he fell and the same things happened again it froze and got a virus.I was talking how cute ginger was and automatically ginger came out of nowhere so kids do not download this is soo scary."

"3329",526819635,"The app tells you if where you are currently is an evacuation zone. You can also type in your address and it will tell you. One add I would suggest is since we have so many bridges in this city, have a bridge status telling what bridges are open or closed."
"3330",526819635,"Very helpful app, hard to identify your zone with the evacuation zone map, this is mainly due low resolution, surprisingly the search bar will let you know your zone by typing your home address."

The issue is I have more than enough coins and it does not have a star lock on it.  So I restarted the app and still nothing.  I tried to redownload the app to see if that‚Äôs the issue and now all my progress and the coins I bought are now gone.  I need a resolution for this.

"3343",528122602,"Now that pretty much all iPads have support for the Apple Pencil it makes no sense that the pen input in this app is as TERRIBLE as it is.   Walking around a job site using this app with the pencil allows you to make comments and notes just as if you were carrying a full size set of drawings with you and is a lot easier that typing notes while walking around the site.   The desktop programs are amazing and I don‚Äôt know what I would do without them. I just don‚Äôt understand why they wouldn‚Äôt make the iOS app in the same fashion.   I could say I would update this review and give it full stars once the pencil support gets better but I have been waiting for improvements on this app for over a year. It doesn‚Äôt even get updated regularly."

I liked that I could easily get files onto my iPad through the Studio feature, and I liked the ability to create tool sets on the Desktop that would transfer to the iPad app.  However, ever since Nametshek bought BlueBeam, there seems to have been a complete lack of support and development for the iPad app.  Seriously: not even a release to fix bugs in at least 11 months!  Most good apps release bug fixes every week or two.  I also see all of the instability issues that the other reviewers mention.  Whenever another Architect asks me how I use BlueBeam on the iPad, one of the first things I mention is to Save Often, because the app WILL crash on you regularly.  Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt found a good replacement yet, but I am definitely looking.  One star for giving up on what could be a great product."

I want to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the app devs who worked long and hard to make this app available for so many years.  This app was a big deal in many peoples childhoods.

"3367",529646208,"I've purchased hundreds of apps and never reviewed one, until now. This app is utterly mind blowing. Go for the full pro package with 240 pro renderings. IMHO, this app is incredibly underpriced!!  Developers, thank you so much for keeping this app updated."
"3368",529646208,"I‚Äôve been trying to teach myself fractals with a PC program for years and have never been able to figure out how to get the beautiful images I often see.

"3373",529815782,"I‚Äôve had this app for a while and have found the information helpful. I opened the app recently and all of the content is gone. No Calendar, no information about leaps, nothing. It is now just a 4 page ad for the Wonder Weeks book. I don‚Äôt know if the developer screwed up their update or if this was intentional, but I‚Äôm deleting it. A subscription fee that exceeds the cost of buying the book is ridiculous."
"3374",529815782,"This app was good when I bought it, over a year ago. And then came the updates! It constantly repeats itself, doesn‚Äôt give you much clue or tip (real ones not the bla-bla-bla of now) and keep on reminding you that each kid is different and goes at his own pace bla-bla-bla. So basically they don‚Äôt say anything and you don‚Äôt learn much... too bad, I liked it BEFORE. Now, there is nothing in this app that you can‚Äôt find on the internet."
"3375",529815782,"I bought a great app.  Then it upgraded an app that is one giant ad for the book... so I paid to be advertised to.  Nice ploy.    I still struggle to see what these leaps are in my child, there‚Äôs nothing remotely similar to the described behavior anywhere near the times they list, and support for dating questions has been paltry at best. It‚Äôs still good information about development and skills my baby is learning, just because it doesn‚Äôt come close to describing my child certainly doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong.   I‚Äôm fairly angry about the huge loss of info with the update though. Crappy move."

"3379",530060483,"This port has a lot of potential, but the controls in this version hold it back from being great.  One major issue is the movement. You will often find yourself stopping in the middle of movement because your thumb will slightly be off the joystick. This creates an incredibly unenjoyable experience, especially when the game requires your movement to be slick and reactive. If that can be fixed, I can see myself having fun with this game. Otherwise, I'd rather save myself from the frustration.  Also, please add iPhone X support."
"3380",530060483,"Great game. I have completed the final mission several times and cannot replay it after completing. It re-makes me play mission 4 to get to the final mission again. Also can you update for iPhone X?"

"3388",530445196,"I was very excited about the concept of this game.  I found myself rather disappointed.  The stat bonus system is absolutely tedious!  The game has MAJOR balance issues - toward the end equipment doesn‚Äôt even matter since your character stats are enormous in comparison.  All my characters get 1 shot killed and only win by mobbing enemies.  The jobs are ... bad.  Most of these (like merchant, Carpenter etc) should just be aspects of town building.  I don‚Äôt want to fight dragons with merchants, carpenters and ... clowns???  The endgame character class (no need for diversity because it dominates everything) is literally a blockhead.  The present / medal system also silly and tedious.  I wanted to build a town, attract character classes based on how I developed my town (which would five replay value) instead of ‚Äúcollect them all.‚Äù  I was looking forward to the passive nature of this game but found myself constantly sucked into tedious tasks.    Worth a play through but ZERO replay value.  The concept is amazing.  If the developer had consulted to implement better and more traditional rpg mechanics for the characters this could have been such an amazing game.  Turned out kinda mediocre."

"3390",530445196,"I would really like for devs to make a DV 2 and I would definitely buy it. Or make more content to this one.

"3405",531184261,"This game is really well done, the gameplay is smooth, the AI is challenging and adaptive but not overly frustrating, and their is a good collection of guns and customization. Only thing is please please add iPhone X support so I don‚Äôt have black spaces on the sides of my screen."

"3416",532046195,"Real gem in the rough. Tone sphere is a unique and interesting take on the standard rhythm game. With good songs, novel gameplay, and cool design, this game is definitely worth trying."
"3417",532046195,"The new released 'dark sphere' is pure wonder and well worth the wait. I like the song 'Astra walk through' in particular."
"3418",532138534,"I loved this game until I couldn‚Äôt play it any more because the software wasn‚Äôt able to go with the current versions! So if the developers read this please update it!"
"3419",532138534,"This is a great game filled with endless hours of fun but the only issue now is almost nobody can play it because of iOS 11 .  So please make the fans of this game happy and update it to make this masterpiece to work with iOS 11!"
"3420",532138534,"I bought this game a few years ago and thought it was pretty fun but I never finished it. I decided to try it again and can‚Äôt even play it now!"

"3422",533024665,"It charged me for the expansion TWICE because at first I thought it didn‚Äôt go through and I‚Äôm still not able to play it :( other than ripping me off it‚Äôs a fun game"
"3423",533024665,"I just bought this game last night and played it three times. During the last play through I was able to make it to safe haven. Everyone in perfect health, car running great but a little low on ammo. Ok, now to collect 8 gas cans. Don‚Äôt ask me how this happened but I lost my entire part in less than 5 minutes. One touch from a zombie is an instant kill. My leader was attacked or touched by zombies too many times while scavenging, but was easily healed with medkits. I had several but wasn‚Äôt allowed to use them if a zombie touched me searching for the gas cans. That seemed like a low blow to me after making it this far in perfect health. After sacrificing my last teammate to have the zombies eat him to distract, I collected the remaining 3 gas cans. Strangely, I ended up collecting 13 of 8 gas cans and then the game was stuck and couldn‚Äôt get to the next part. Very frustrating and disappointed after thinking this was a great game up to this point. I‚Äôll try it again and see if I can get 8 of 8 cans cans this time."

"3428",533079551,"This is just like COD Zombies and it also has an endless mode unlike other zombie games on the AppStore! I usually get the AK47 when I start the game because it‚Äôs amazing for lower levels. But please add more to the story and apart from that it‚Äôs an amazing game. Wow! You read all of this?

"3436",534282109,"I gave it 4 stars only because even if the game is fun and relaxing it needs alot of work still. They need to update it by giving us humans and natural disasters. Wouldn't it be nice having a volcano that erupts or hurricanes and even rain storms? If we are all paying for this game then the least you can do is update the game.I hesitated it to buy it but i have high hopes they will have a major update soon. Please listen to us!!!!"
"3437",534282109,"The more support this game gets from the players, the better updates we will have in the future. I have been waiting for this title to be released and I'm so glad to own it on my iPhone! I am very pleased with the look and feel of the game. The controls are simple enough, you don't really need much of a Tutorial to get started (although I'm glad it was there to follow).  Any Strategy, RPG or Achievement features in future updates will absolutely have continued support from me. This title sets itself apart from all other games released in the App Store. Great work, Crescent Moon and Glenn Corpes!  [EDIT] Crescent & Corpes, Just take a step back to previous releases (such as Topia World Builder) and polish them off a tad bit more ;) Topia is analogous to an unfinished sculpture that shouldn‚Äôt take too much effort to polish, but it would be great if the imbalances everyone is mentioning are tweaked. Put your mind to it and create a balance between all ecology. Do that, and players can REALLY create their world and watch it thrive."
"3438",534282109,"It wont let me do anything! It just puts me through some dumb credits and I don‚Äôt get to make anything aside from the tutorials. I‚Äôm so angry!! üò° please fix NOW I just spent REAL MONEY and I would like to BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME I MEAN HOW CAN YOU MISS THAT"
"3439",534342529,"Fun and addictive but the ads!!! I HATE the long boring ads! A quick flash of an ad would work better with me. If an ad frustrates me I will refuse to use a product! For example that solitaire ad has taken so much of my time I won‚Äôt even look at it and I love solitaire. Don‚Äôt force long ads on me and I‚Äôd give this game 5 stars!"
"3440",534342529,"Great game!"
"3441",534342529,"I love bubble mania.  This is the best game ever.  It is fun and challenging and the games keep changing which holds my interest.  Each new island contains a new game twist.  Jump in and swim to the fun!  Dr. purplebaker"
"3442",534477679,"I absolutely hate it it is soo not worth like 3$"
"3443",534477679,"Okay it‚Äôs fun at first but then it just gets plain boring, it just repeats the same treatments with deferent characters  üôÅ"
"3444",534477679,"I like it because it‚Äôs so fun and provides learning"

"3448",534568162,"They blackout the video you need to watch; The fighters information is a joke; Mainly whatever you need you won‚Äôt find it in here. Just cancel my subscription"
"3449",534568162,"I use it to watch past fights and they update the new ones pretty fast. I can‚Äôt pay for the newer fights this is a great alternative."
"3450",534568162,"The mammoth amount of fights available on ufc fight pass alone is worth the app and every penny of the membership. Navigation is a little wompy but everything works and plays smooth. There‚Äôs a lot more to the fight pass than just ufc. If you‚Äôre a fan of combat sports, it is seriously a must. I can‚Äôt speak to the usefulness of the app outside of Ufcfightpass though."
"3451",534960206,"I have all the apps by this developer, the papers are pure awesomeness.  I had no use to try the video insert until recently,  The quality is not so great. Otherwise an outstanding app."
"3452",534960206,"Original review: Love the bubbles but would love more.  The finished product looks great but would love more flexibility with shapes and a way to save ""favorite"" settings etc. Glad I have it though.  Was a 4 but now a 2 Star rating. This app used to be called BubbleFrame, and inexplicably got a ‚Äúmakeover‚Äù, but unfortunately not to my expectations. What happened to the beautiful logo which actually made sense (It said Bubble Frames, and showed Bubble frames, imagine that) and how did it change from all bubble frames, to other random frames, too, which I have other apps that can already do this and just clutters up the app. Why did I lose the ability to create single bubble-shaped frames, without having to pay for an IAP to unlock this, when I bought this app years ago and it allowed for single bubbles? I used to use this a lot for my Apps blog, but am unhappy with the changes."
"3453",534960206,"I wish there were updates on backgrounds for the collages.   I LOVE that you can download your own fonts!!"
"3454",535127218,"I have played/coached in dozens of organized sports leagues and Upward Sports is BY FAR the most efficient and effective. As a coach, this app provides a ‚Äúone stop shop‚Äù for accessing all the tools I need for communicating with parents, practice and game schedules, preparing weekly training, reviewing objectives, and many other necessary tasks that would ordinarily take dozens of hours to complete. This app allows coaches to spend more time investing in the children, which to me, is the most important thing."
"3455",535127218,"This is a wonderful tool for Upward, but it does glitch.  I have already lost all data once.  Having to log on each time is also a hassle...once on my device it should be able to open and run without a log in.  There is nothing that merits bank account security measures."
"3456",535127218,"Not a bad app but never leaves me signed in, even when i toggle to stay signed in."
"3457",535153636,"This is not accurate at all. Would give zero stars. It matched me with a woman of a different race."
"3458",535153636,"It is just terrible"
"3459",535153636,"I would get done putting a picture in and then I would submit the things I liked and then it clicked enter, well the loading thing came up and I thought nothing of I gave it a few minutes but nothing and then it kicked me out of the game! I have perfect internet and everything i still don‚Äôt get why it wouldn‚Äôt give me my results. If I could rate this a 0 I definitely would!  |‚Ä¢DONT BUY THIS‚Ä¢|"
"3460",535176909,"It‚Äôs good game and I enjoying it!"
"3461",535176909,"This app is a really good app and I like it a lot I love playing it all the time I love making levels. I also like that you can play with friends so I‚Äôll just ask my friends to come over and we just play Badlands and then we get to create levels together and overall this is a awesome app I paid $.99 for it and it was awesome so you guys should try it anyone who sees it and who‚Äôs interested in it to try it it‚Äôs a really good app I recommend it for all ages and I gave this a five star rating. Thank you üëçüèºüôÉ"
"3462",535176909,"Simply astonishing how well crafted and executed this game is. It‚Äôs incredible simply in its controls but the various mechanics and level designs keep you thrilled. So many features and levels makes this game worth every single penny."

"3475",535811906,"I got this app several years ago when the app was paid only, and there were several fonts included in that amount and even back then there were paid font packs. I logged on to find that they now removed many of the fonts I previously ""paid"" for because it is now a free app and they put those very same fonts in the paid section so I would have to repay to get them. That's just wrong and needs to be fixed."
"3476",535811906,"I had an issue with suddenly not getting access to google search that I always had and Eve & Lauren both did  some research addressing my problem.

The app itself seems pretty nice, but is basically useless if it can't be synchronized.  If I get a prompt response to my request for help, I'll upgrade the score.  I'm not alone in this issue or the lack of customer support, so I'm probably out a few bucks."

"3488",536433148,"I used to love this game, it used to have an iOS version but then, when it updated it had no iOS version. I was very sad, and surprised. I tried almost everything just to play the game.then I just gave up,now up to this day I‚Äôm still trying. Please, Make the iOS version."

"3490",536475199,"I've had some difficulty finding educational apps that my 18 month old daughter enjoys and is capable of playing. This app is PERFECT! She easily picked up on it and even loves the menu screen where she can interact with different objects that move and make sounds. I'm sure she will continue to play this for at least another year or two as she learns to talk and count herself. Definitely worth the cost and highly recommend to parents of other young toddlers."
"3491",536475199,"Not the best app. Keeps my two year old busy for a short time and then he gets bored. Doesn't really teach them to count, just tapping on pictures. However, for the price it's worth the few minutes of entertainment."

"3495",536495161,"I‚Äôve read a few reviews about how this app was made worse with the upgrade from 9 months ago. I agree with them. It used to be Great, BUT NOT ANYMORE. I loved this app and did a lot of time lapse and stop motion with it. I had many more plans to continue to use it. However, with the new update I‚Äôve had a hard time getting motivated to use it. They dumbed it down to try and appeal to the novice. However, this has made it so that I don‚Äôt like to use it. Some of the changes that have made it worse are: 1. Made it so that I cannot change the frame rate. I can only change the length of the video. However, sometimes it take me more than one shoot to complete a video. Since I cannot change the frame rate I have to hope I get all the length accurate so the video speed works right. 2. The preview mode loops the video. So, when I watch a preview it plays it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Until I finally realize that I‚Äôve watched it many times. Especially, since the default time is 5 seconds. Who does a 4000 frame time lapse video in 5 seconds? 3. The settings window is useless. First, it‚Äôs too small to use, why not make it fill most of the screen? Second, I‚Äôve changed the settings and closed out of them. However, when I get back in the settings, its as if I didn‚Äôt even do anything. What is the point of having settings if I cannot change the settings. Get us back to the ugly looking version that ACTUALLY WORKED!!!  One last point, I would pay at least $20, or more, for a good quality time lapse - stop motion app. This app used to be worth that. Now its not even worth the storage space it is written on."

I‚Äôve been playing it on my iPad and it‚Äôs beautiful and I think the perfect size. I ignored the part that said to wear headphones and played several times without one. Wish now I hadn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a completely different experience with the sounds I never heard, streams of music I missed and even parts of the narration I missed as well. Wear headphones! And try different mixes of weapons, etc. You may think you have the perfect combination until you try something else. Some things work better in different parts of the game. I love this game!

They forcefully remove videos because some people get their feelings hurt even if what was said was accurate. Feelings are being placed above the truth. They claim they are a platform however they act as if they are publishers and ban people with whom they disagree. They create vague guidelines like no hate speech, but don‚Äôt define what counts as hate speech and then they arbitrarily ban people who break this undefined guideline. Videos of people civilly having discussions are demonetized for some unknown reason. And there are many more failings of YouTubes policies on what is acceptable in the videos that people upload."

"3585",544118997,"Great app until something goes wrong. For me it was my mom forgetting her email address. Those that use the app know that when you first make a purchase you get 10 dollars back. She bought some stuff for my dad for his birthday and when she went to get her cash back she needed to verify her email. Since she‚Äôs not too good with technology I emailed ebates for her. They changed her email after I provided some proof but they also combined my account and hers because they thought we were the same person trying to get 10 dollars. After multiple emails, talking to multiple different members, explaining how we are not the same person, they still refused to give her money to her. It got to the point where I scheduled to a time to call and talk with them, but they conveniently called in a time I was not free. After a while I just gave up on it. I hope no one ever has to deal with their customer support like I had to. Oh and the only reason they thought that we were the same person was because I used my paypal for her account. Like I said she‚Äôs not good with technology so instead of waiting for a check of 10 dollars to come in I said I would give her the money and just use my PayPal. No matter how many people I talked to, they just kept bringing that up and even after I wasted my time doing things they wanted to prove I wasn‚Äôt trying to scam the system, they still kept repeating the fact that my PayPal is on her account. If the company is that desperate to keep their 10 dollars, maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have offered it as a starting bonus.  Months later still haven‚Äôt been helped even after I write this review and followed the steps they asked for. I sent them what they wanted and they never responded. I sent another message asking how much longer it would take, and shocker, they didn‚Äôt respond."
"3586",544119998,"If you like synths, get this! One of my faves. Gives awesome crisp modern sounds, but can do a good range in general. There are lots of synths out there, but I feel this one has a character that really sets it apart from others. Kauldron is also a great one from this developer. The two are definitely on my top 8 must-have list.  This synth has so many features, yet it is so well designed that it‚Äôs super straightforward to use. Everything is in the right place. No clutter, yet a lot of controls per page. I usually prefer external fx, but in this synth they really fit in well with the sound.  It‚Äôs hard to pick a best synth in terms of sound because each covers different ground or different approaches to sound design, but in terms of UI it‚Äôs easier to pick because a lot of synths have weak UI. Magellan is definitely at the top, along with Nave - both being beautiful and usable at the same time. Both feel like you have a hardware synth in your hands, and are just a pleasure to use for the eyes, ears, and fingers too.  Only request I have is, please make presets save both synths. There are 2 synth engines that can be used individually or together. You can save each independently and load them, but can‚Äôt save the two combined. Using both engines really gives beautifully huge sound! As a workaround I save them as name-part1, name-part2 so it‚Äôs not really that hard to load the two together later, just think it makes more sense to just treat both synths as a single preset. Oh, and if you could give this synth an AUv3... goes without saying ;)"
"3587",544119998,"This synth looks amazing and it‚Äôs easy to modify the sounds and customize things to your liking and it sounds nice through the iPad speakers. Unfortunately when you plug in high quality headphones the sounds are very .... thin. They sound toy-like at best. There is a sound or two that works even with those limitations, and I suppose that‚Äôs worth the $5. But only three stars."

"3592",544695089,"Or the best one out of the three.   TWEWY is an amazing game and story.  If you have a chance to play it you should!  The story is interesting and the location of Shibuya comes alive.   On why this is the best version of the game:  I have played this game on all systems it has come on.   ‚Ä¢The DS graphics are just a little tired and needing to ‚Äúmingle‚Äù with other people IRL playing it for LVing up certain pins makes it hard and time consuming.  (But it can be done given just lots of time waiting)  And sometimes playing on both screens doing different things can give you a headache.  Over all though it‚Äôs a lot of fun.  ‚Ä¢This app has updated graphics and increased the storyline a little.  All the pins still LV up in the same way as before.  When you need to ‚Äúmingle‚Äù just play TinPin Slammer.  I find this to be the easiest of all the versions to play overall.  However this app did stop working a few years ago after a iOS update and it took SquareEnix months to get it working again.  But this is also the cheapest of all the versions as well.  I don‚Äôt think that will happen again however.  ‚Ä¢The Switch version of TWEWY is the newest but uses the same graphics as the app.  (Its mainly a port of the app with another small epilogue added to hint at another game that may or may not come)  It also changes how you LV up certain pins by totally removing ‚Äúmingle‚Äù points.  Not a difficult thing to deal with but it is worth mentioning.  The problem with the Switch version of this game is the controls.  None of them want to work!  Touchscreen works the most like the older versions.  Trying to used a controller means only using 1 and motion control which is a little wonky.   Switch is also currently the most expensive.   I hope this helps other people decide what version of this wonderful game they want to play."
"3593",544695089,"But this version is missing a lot and I know that the mobile version is not supposed to look like this. I‚Äôm missing basically every cutscene in the game and even redownloading the app didn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs a shame because I‚Äôve been very interested in playing the game for so long only to pay almost $20.00 for an incomplete version."

"3624",546871573,"I really enjoyed playing this game, but now find myself playing less and less. Too many frickin‚Äô ads!! I get it...to get an extra ball or some benefit, ya watch an ad,  but now there are ads in between what seems like every game as well. It gets old! I‚Äôm sorry,  I know this game is free but as far as I feel you‚Äôve sold out. Not to mention, it crashes a lot more than it use to, and I lose whatever it was I was playing. At first I thought it was my tablet, cuz it was old, but now I have a new tablet and it still does it, and now after reading a lot of these reviews, I tend to think it wasn‚Äôt my old tablet after all. From the looks of it, you guys are losing people left and right, I would think you‚Äôd want to do something to rectify that, and make this game fun to play again, but like a lot of the reviews on here, I guess you‚Äôre in it for the money.....well good luck with that."

Sometimes when big tricks are done but the board just slightly touches an object (even if you still land) it will count the trick as a fail because a part of the board knicked a ledge or rail over your gap.

Approximately two straight days of watching later it all comes to a grinding halt when Netflix suggests you try other historical dramas. But why? This can‚Äôt be! You‚Äôve only seen two seasons and you know there are two more and in a panic you take to Google to demand answers. Here you learn Netflix, the Zeus of all streaming services, has only been able to acquire the first two seasons and you must stoop to Prime or Hulu or....Starz to continue. But Prime and Hulu require you to buy a Starz pass so with a sinking heart you realise there‚Äôs only one way forward. You must use your time wisely and your one week of free Starz to watch the other two seasons. You sign up and download the app only to find you get ‚Äúlogin error‚Äù every time you try, the app is useless and your well planned binge watch is ruined. This is where I‚Äòm at and now I‚Äôm tied to my laptop for the foreseeable future all because the app is dysfunctional and I hate a cliff hanger."

You start off with a lower level horse, but you can soon buy more competitive horses and compete in more competitions. I've never had any glitches or with this game and I personally enjoy just watching my horses compete and leaving it up to the computer to decide whether I will do well or not. I do wish that there would be more options for training and possibly more courses to compete with. There are only six whereas  Race Horse Championships (another great game by them that I highly recommend) has 15. Another great thing about this game is that you can breed horses. The cost of breeding depends on the sire and dam that you choose. My only problem with breeding is that it gets more expensive each time you do it. The graphics aren't anything over the top, but I personally like more simplistic games which is just another reason why I love this! If you love horses or just want a fun game to play, this is definitely the right game for you."

"3742",555233356,"I don‚Äôt understand why this would be so outdated.   I literally have the classic version, just not the original. This means characters and rooms are the same with the exception of new additions, like Dr. Orchid. You literally can‚Äôt purchase the original in stores anymore.  There should be an option to add/change the rooms, weapons, and characters. I don‚Äôt understand why you can‚Äôt customize the app seeing that it simply runs algorithms to calculate who absolutely does and does not have what cards.   Customization should really be an option in this app. I mean, it even saves the developers time seeing as they don‚Äôt have to update it to include new cards EVER.  I already paid for the app, but I‚Äôd be willing to pay up to 5x the price I did for it to simply be customizable so that it works for any version.   I left 1 star because it isn‚Äôt compatible with my game, even though I have the updated classic version (the one available in store). I will update my review pending a response that goes over plans to capitalize on this, or an update to include customization."
"3743",555233356,"The rooms do not match the rooms in our game. We have a kitchen, bathroom, office, bedroom, courtyard, game room, garage, living room, and dining room. The flip side is a boardwalk with Ferris wheel, jet ski rental, beach, beach house, arcade, and surf shop. Would be good if names could be adjusted accordingly. We were excited to try the app to use in place of paper. My kids and I play the game frequently."

"3745",555376968,"Using this fantasy football app is what I imagine it feels like trying to figure out an iPhone as a 100 year old with Alzheimer‚Äôs. It‚Äôs so difficult to use, the interface is unappealing and riddled with advertisements, and there‚Äôs far to many steps to see simple data at times. The Yahoo Fantasy Football app is far and away better, easier to use, and more visually appealing. I love ESPN, but this app needs a MAJOR revamp or I‚Äôll be sticking with Yahoo."
"3746",555376968,"Can‚Äôt do a lot of the stuff in the app that you can do on the site, especially when it comes to player research. It‚Äôs absolute torture in the app, due to some really stupid design decisions."

"3754",555916407,"I appreciate a challenging puzzle, but there‚Äôs absolutely zero help in this game. It‚Äôs also not friendly to people who are hard of hearing or who have ringing in their ears like I do. I can‚Äôt get past the dark woods. I‚Äôm assuming that you have to choose the path with appropriate scale tone, but it‚Äôs very frustrating for people with damaged hearing. Otherwise I absolutely loved the content and the graphics. Problem is that when you get stuck, you‚Äôre 100% totally done with the game. So I guess I‚Äôm done about 10 minutes in."
"3755",555916407,"there‚Äôs a difference between being challenging yet engaging and rewarding and being completely obtuse and impenetrable. year walk‚Äôs puzzles are the latter. there‚Äôs also a difference between creating a creepy, haunting atmosphere and having jumpscares every time the player makes any progress. again, year walk is the latter. it would be cynical to say the obnoxious difficulty is to stretch the game‚Äôs length out to justify asking for 4 dollars, but unfortunately that seems to be pretty accurate. the companion is a nice idea but the lore it provides is pretty categorically not helpful. the art and sound design are nice. if you want good puzzles and/or creepy atmosphere i‚Äôd recommend something out of the cube escape series (many of which are FREE) or even this same company‚Äôs title DEVICE 6, which is superb. year walk, however, is just too unintuitive and poorly executed to recommend."
"3756",555916407,"I honestly loved this game. The puzzles are challenging and the story is very intriguing. I will say that it is important for someone playing this to get the companion. Besides having information about the research that went into the game, it is essential to unlocking the alternate ending."

So I have to say that I am sorry I said you are the worst and I'm not playing your games anymore. I'm gonna play one of your games right now and I will put a 5 star review."
"3762",556164008,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is a very good app. But in my case it just takes up too much space on my phone. Other then that it is really fun. The graphics are great, and it is so fun to play."
"3763",556382158,"This game is a blast to play on any phone older than the iPhone X. The controls need to be brought up from the swipe to home button. I used to play this when I had an older phone, but can no longer play with the X."
"3764",556382158,"Ok. I love this game and would give it 5 stars, but... Played it several times over and try different tactics each time to keep it interesting. However, just tried to play recently and I can‚Äôt use the bottom slider to turn my ships or aim the turrets without closing or switching the app. iPhoneX uses screen gestures. Anyone have a fix for this?!"
"3765",556382158,"The way this game was built, means you cannot play on an iPhone 10. Can‚Äôt change direction or anything as the control for that is the same place as the function on the phone to close an app."
"3766",556430416,"This game is INCREDIBLE!!! I‚Äôm twelve years old, and seriously, you shouldn‚Äôt be fooled by the 4 plus heading, because if you use my hack, this game is for all ages. In the app, not only can you choose designs and accessorize your character, but also choose photos from your camera role to use when making the clothes. So, keep reading for the hack: you can search the web for any image you want, or even a paused moment from a video- really anything you can screenshot. Then, enter the app and go to the photo album, where you can use your screenshot as a design for a shirt, dress, skirt, pants, shorts, or sleeves. Or all of the above! I‚Äôve already spent hours browsing the web for photos that match the accessories in the app, and by using this hack, you likely will too. This game has virtually no limits, and I have only one warning: once you download it, you won‚Äôt ever want to put your phone down. üòÑüòÑüòÑ"
"3767",556430416,"OK so let‚Äôs game is super fun and addicting but I wish there was a way to get out of the photo thing I tried it and I was stuck in there my iPad is frozen and I won‚Äôt unfreeze like what so if you don‚Äôt have this problem you should definitely buy it if you have this problem delete the app and re-download it that would be awesome I have no idea how to fix my problem."

"3776",557121061,"i‚Äôve been using this app for so long i can‚Äôt remember how many years!   And it‚Äôs STILL my FAVORITE APP ‚ù£Ô∏è"
"3777",557121061,"I have tried a lot of the multi-purpose (typing, handwriting, audio and video, import web materials, and presentation) apps, and I like this one the best (by far). Here's why.  1.  The handwriting recognition module (an in-app purchase), called Mazec, is simply the most reliable and easy to use of any offered. 2.  The variety of writing implements offered are easy to access, and the handwriting experience is excellent.  Because of ease of access, it is easy to change implements quickly -- essential for note taking in a fast-paced classroom or lecture environment. 3.  One can use pinch and zoom or bottom zoom for handwriting. Writing with pinch and zoom also has auto scrolling, so you don't get stray lines on your page. 3.  Pages and backgrounds can be imported or created and then made into templates.  Thus, the user has an infinite variety of page backgrounds. 4.  One can cut and paste pages not only between documents, but also between Metamoji apps (for example, between Note and Share). 5. The entire note background (not just the page) can be used for posting photos and typed materials; handwriting can be created on the page and then moved (pasted) on the note background.  Thus the entire canvas (page and note background) can be used. 6. App can accommodate very long notes (over 100 pages) without slowing down.   7. Notes can be stored in a comprehensive filing system using folders and infinite levels of subfolders.   8. Tagging system allows the same note to be stored in several folders at once.  Just add tags corresponding to different folders' names, and the note appears in all the named folders. 9. The app has its own cloud system, Metamoji cloud, which works reliably.  Documents can thus be synced among devices. 10.  The iPhone app is as full-featured as the apps for iPad, and one purchase covers everything.  I am sure that I have forgotten to mention some other crucially important features.  I use this app for everything.  I would probably need several apps in order to do all that this one can do."
"3778",557130558,"I‚Äôve used this app for over 2 years now and a lot has drastically changed.  Pros: You meet language natives of the language you want to learn. It gives you a little bit experience in tutoring your own native language. You get to share cultures with other people. You have the chance to make many friends.  Cons: Sometimes when I take too long to make a post on the moments, Hellotalk automatically restarts and doesn‚Äôt save my progress. Many times, I‚Äôve had this bug issue where friends would send me a message and I would not receive it until way later. Another bug issue is that sometimes I‚Äôm not able to view the moments, messages, or people recommendations because the app is unable to connect.  There are a lot of toxic trolls that have tried to start arguments with me, on my moments posts and they constantly return to any new posts I make. There are a lot of people that don‚Äôt try to exchange language or culture. I‚Äôve gotten few VERY weird messages from both genders, from different countries. Due to the amount of weird, shady, and toxic people on the app; it makes finding friends/language partners, very difficult as a male. The system for moderating the moments is a bit unfair.         ‚ÄîSomeone reported one of my posts for being ‚Äúa dating purpose‚Äù, although that was not my intent nor did I ask any questions for dating on that post. Instead, the post was taken down without question and I got a warning. I have doubts that the post was manually reviewed. I didn‚Äôt even know what the post was, and I had to personally use the in-app messaging to Hellotalk to question what was taken down. Although it was just a warning, I‚Äôve noticed that no one is viewing my educational posts anymore on the moments. So I‚Äôm assuming that I‚Äôm being censored without my own knowledge, considering that I have over 1000 people that follow me because they view my moments as useful for practice and learning.  Overall, the intent of the app‚Äôs goal is admirable; but it is severely lacking in specific areas that cause many good people to voluntarily leave the app."
"3779",557130558,"The main language has changed suddenly and they didn‚Äôt fix it. That made the app is 0% useful.  +VIP is a joke .."
"3780",557130558,"I love meeting with chatting with natives and I love the fact that the conversation can automatically translate and the feature to correct. My only comment would be I wish I could set my preferences as to who can contact me or see me. The messages can get overwhelming especially if it's not what you are looking for. I know you filter in search but I would to just set my preference in my profile. Example: Brazilian Portuguese vs European Portuguese."

I was scammed out of 600 pounds and after reporting it Shpock didn‚Äôt respond for days. When they did days later they told me the transaction was fraudulent. Really?!!! I had already told them. I then followed the scammer and they are still posting on Shpock. The company refuses to check IP address and do anything.

Started copying files over and within 30 minutes, I bought File Manager Pro.  WHAT A STRUGGLE/NIGHTMARE! The Pro install left the Free version on my machine and imported  NOTHING! So I uninstalled the Free version and started ALL OVER AGAIN with the Pro version... The NIGHTMARE CONTINUED! Then after about 1/2 hour I glanced at the Tutorial. Didn‚Äôt think much of it - pretty basic - a quick, cursory review and it gave me a couple ideas of things to try. 10 more minutes and the clouds parted, the sunshine came out and this is app is 5 stars for sure.  Sometimes, it seems like the more irritated I get the less I‚Äôm willing to look at a tutorial. ...phfffff"

I received an email today letting me know that my account had been deactivated for violating the terms of use. I‚Äôm not sure how that would have happened when I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I opened the app. I‚Äôm waiting for a response to an inquiry to their customer service team, but I‚Äôm pretty unhappy with this turn of events.

"3811",560372072,"I played this game religiously for the last two months.  Started playing for real $$ about 3-4 weeks ago and enjoyed playing.  For over a week now, each and every time I start a match the system glitches.  Reached out to support 8 times and received 8 responses asking me to identify the match # or my opponent but the matches never got past a freeze screen and I had no way to provide what the tech agents were asking for.  I was told to trick the system by using a volume button pattern and even after I did this, copied and pasted it to an external email, no fix but my actual $$ was gone because they charge 10% of the match price when you ‚Äútied‚Äù.  It was my favorite app of the year now I believe it‚Äôs just a scam.  Just for the aggregation they should refund my entire deposit.  Asked for a phone cal to explain the glitch but they are not offering ‚Äúphone support‚Äù at this time.  Play the game and have fun for ‚ÄúZ‚Äù tickets but DO NOT give them your money if you want to ‚ÄúWin‚Äù.  The company profits 20% per match.  Multiply this SMALL fee time 1,000‚Äôs and you can all do the math.  Hope you have a better experience than me.  I‚Äôm very unhappy.   ...all over $2.00 prompted me to write this.

"3814",560586497,"This app is great in concept, and I‚Äôve really tried to use it, but there is no way to move the interface to the right side of the screen, which means frequently bumping different buttons and icons with the wrist and palm as a left handed person, which completely kills any chance of every getting into a work flow in this app. It does have some features that apps like Procreate do not, but Procreate does account for left-handedness, so I will just stick with that. :/  Updated: The developer responded to my issue of left-handed support and turns out I just wasn‚Äôt looking in the right place haha! Upgraded my review accordingly since this app has since been great for drafting out ideas for everything from web projects to 3D prints. The way the canvas can keep expanding and be rotated is amazing. No more trying to squeeze a bunch of details into the constraints of a single page!"

"3816",560586497,"One problem I‚Äôve often found in many drawing and painting programs, as well as on paper and canvas, is that I tend to have issues with initial sketching.  Something about the process has always felt, somewhat claustrophobic to me, if that makes sense?  What with not knowing exactly how the finished piece will turn out, it begins to feel more and more cramped as more is added to the canvas.  This app, however, completely gets rid of that feeling for me, and allows me to just continue to sketch on and on to my hearts‚Äôs content, without any feeling that I'm running out of space, and then allows me to export my sketches, from which I can then continue and finish them in another program (though, it does seem like you may be able to create good finished pieces here as well, if that better suits your workflow!)  Thank you for this wonderful app!"

At any rate I wanted to see my ticket show up on my list. I closed the modal but the list was empty and there was no record of it anywhere in the app. This made me worried, so I went back to the browser to repeat my steps. I figured I must have read the validate modal wrong the first time, and perhaps that it was actually I that had to do that to add it to my list. I did that, and quickly realized no, that just made the ticket unusable. It sill didn‚Äôt show up on my list...   After I rebooted the app a couple minutes later it finally showed up in my list. Presumably it wouldn‚Äôt show up without going to talk to the server. This was very confusing and frustrating, and now I have no idea if my ticket will be usable."

"3833",561941526,"This game is somewhat addicting but also very annoying. There are often competitions where you need to accomplish things but you get to a point where you can no longer accomplish things without spending gems. There is no indication whatsoever as to when this will occur or when you will be eligible to go further. It is quite rediculous and completely unexplained! They really need to fix this aspect of the game. An example is you have to collect food 6 times. It only lets you collect 5 times then you can collect as much as you like and it won't count it for no given reason. This is extremely annoying and I absolutely hate this aspect of the game!!"

However ive been playing it over the years and you used to be able to get coins through downloading apps and completing different FREE tasks, but now the tasks ask you to spend money, sign up for something or watch a video that isnt even worth the time because they give so little coins. So essentially there is no way for you to get cards outside of logging on each day for 10,000 which is only 5-10 cards depending on what you choose. The app is trash unless you want to spend money on virtual cards that one day will cease to exist."
"3846",563027226,"I downloaded this game and proceeded to open some packs with my starting coins. I opened the packs and to my amazement I received a very cool looking card that was very rare (less than 130 in game)! I was very happy to have gotten this card so I decided to ‚Äúsave it‚Äù by connecting my gmail account. Upon doing so I was met with the unfortunate truth that my account had been reset and I had lost that very valuable card. I instantly deleted the app and I will never play again.  0 out of 10 stars.

After downloading I ran into the same issue, HOWEVER there is a super simple fix to see the vessel names/basic stats. For some reason the app does not default to this; but if you go to settings-map options- you will see ‚Äúvessel names‚Äù, you just have to toggle that on and you will be able to see them for free. A few took a few minutes to update but overall it is working just as the desktop version does."

"3873",564874986,"It is absolutely amazing to me that even after around 2 years of playing this game I am still overcoming new obstacles. This game is EXTREMELY difficult and at sometimes just downright annoying, but that‚Äôs what always kept me coming back and playing again. The main campaign of this game has you backflipping in a unique control scheme that is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever seen before, and there are different unlockable poses that can help you with your backflip, or challenge you. With the added bonus of the ability to ‚Äúcombo‚Äù your positions together allows for what seems like infinite fun. I actually managed to discover how to do a double flip without needing any platforms to jump off of other than the ground with the awesome physics engine that this game has. Also, if you‚Äôre not that into challenge, you can try out the free play mode that lets you experiment with any stage, without lives or basically any restrictions. You can even go into a secret MOON GRAVITY MODE if you tap the screen enough times! And this game basically never crashes, for me, at least, and I‚Äôm using a super old iPad that I just keep updating. On the very small chance that anyone reads this, if you like video games at all, just get this game. It may seem difficult at first, but when you get the hang of it, you open up an entire universe of new possibilities and fun."

Monkey Math School Sunshine and Monkey Word School Adventure.. are the best games out there.. and they are both in this inexpensive bundle..

"3895",567008119,"I‚Äôve played around a bit with this program and my initial thoughts are very positive! When I first opened e-Sword HD and switched over to study mode I was impressed with the layout and the amount of information at my fingertips. Navigating to other resources is simple from the main screen which I love. I‚Äôm sure it is at this screen I‚Äôll spend most of my time. The app comes with a number of great resources free to download and some paid ones but they are not really needed but it is nice they are offered. I did want to get some of my devotionals in here from Donald Fortner. I was thrilled to find a program on the e-Sword site which converts e-Sword PC modules to Apple modules. With what seems like thousands of free modules at BibleSupport.com you can perform some serious bible study with this iPad app. And I now have my daily devotional books from Fortner available for free in the app! If there was any draw back it would have to be the lack of ability to export my notes to e-Sword on my PC which I‚Äôll need to make the full switch from Logos. Looking forward to using this program as it continues to mature."
"3896",567008119,"This is a simple and basic electronic Bible. The e-sword company is putting all their energy into their desktop application and have done an acceptable job porting their work to the iPhone and iPad.  One thing that is lacking, and thus the 4 stars, is that there is no documentation or explanation on how to use the mobile apps.  For example, there is a ‚ÄúBible study‚Äù screen that puts various books in windows on the iPad screen. This is great.  However there is no way to know that the books are, or how to change the books. If I want a different Bible or commentary, there does not seem to be a way to change them.  If there is a way, it is hidden, since, as I said, there I no help built into this app."

It baffles me the number of times we have lost the petit recently. - when you play 5 people and call a king, the default should be for the partner called to put his king down the first time the color is played, not keep it to try to steal points in the future. Very frustrating to lose the called king over half the time. Thanks"

"3905",567457151,"To add extra data, EE gives you the option of texting their number or going to their website. Their text menu has prices ridiculously higher than their website. The website asks you to turn off WiFi to access the website where you can buy data add-ons. Then when you try to buy a data add-on the website asks you to turn back on your WiFi. Obviously, because the website can only be accessed without WiFi on, following the websites instructions causes the connection to the add-on page to be lost.  I finally just downloaded the EE app to get the add-ons there...the add-on page isn‚Äôt on the app yet!! Is EE trying to scam me into buying the expensive text-menu add-ons?

All my saved routines disappeared after updating, think I got some back with restore and reloading. Not happy to see so much more advertising and a push for subscription. Does not look to be worth it.  Too bad!  Update Sept 2019. Think I got back most free classes. Decided to try the trial subscription, not very impressed. No interest in hip hop, meditation. I like Rodney Yee, but his few classes are short, and suddenly springs need for props at you part way through. Any physical class I took had us select our props before class starts.

"3964",572432485,"Pros:  - Visiting Town between chapters is entertaining and makes sense.  - Dialogue is expertly crafted, easily better than the ridiculous Japanese-English translation dialogue that plagued FE games - Character portraits and character personalities (so far) are mostly pretty great, with the ocasional hilariously ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù portrait - Special abilities on characters, including support bonuses boosts the depth of combat. Having an accuracy boost on the pathetically weak main character is especially welcome! - Big maps! Some might complain, about more tapping/clicking/turns to traverse, but big maps make battles feel epic!  Cons:  - Punishing EXP system (esp on expert). You will need to grind, especially with your main character, to get them strong enough to not get one shotted by enemy grunts   Tips (for noobs only):  - Exploit the arena. Revisiting town spawns new random arena match - Save your potions! Should be used in arena only - If you run out of potions for the arena, bring in your healer and do 2v2 matches vs. weak enemies to heal your injured units  - For best EXP gains, it is most effective to unequip your character weapon and wait for a weak enemy to attack (and hopefully miss) for 25 turns, OR attack with slow/weak weapons.  (Edit after response from Developers): Bumped up to 4 stars, since the punishing EXP system works as Devs intended!"
"3965",572432485,"I feel like it‚Äôs an incomplete game with some problems. You can only equip items once you are in a battle, can not upgrade units like upgrade an archer to a sniper, level ups don‚Äôt help much and the max level is only 20 witch I can reach pretty fast, and the story doesn‚Äôt seem so smooth and sometimes hard to understand. I do like how every character has a different face, we are able to train before we move onto the next chapter, there are different endings, and the different game play options was pretty neat. Overall it‚Äôs not really worth the price because of the problems and it‚Äôs not to different from some of the free tactics games on iPhone., but it was enjoyable."
"3966",572432485,"The biggest problem this game has is unit balance; The avatar/main lord has the combat ability of a piece of bread, and some units are way too good (i.e. Tatum). Also, magic feels a bit too good, since the enemy fire mags in chapter two often one shots most of your units. Still, I'm loving this game üëè"

"3970",573516833,"The base game is ok but there is not much strategy involved, and the stacked random encounters ruin the game.   With the base game, you play four characters, each a different class. The base story line has 9 quests. They are endless random quests to do with different rewards and loot. The maps are essentially the same design and your characters skills are determined by your level and items. There isn‚Äôt much option for customization or strategy involved. Just collect the highest level items and hit them before they hit you.   At higher levels, any single random encounter can be as difficult as the end fight. Not great game design but I can accept it. Having 3 or more random encounters stack is really bad design and is just frustrating."
"3971",573516833,"Really appreciated the style and not a pay 2 win style of game. Fun strategy and enough randomization to keep one interested, over all a really great game."

"3992",574641836,"Upon opening the game it brought back memories of the arcade and countless quarters well spent. Good memories. Playing this game did not leave good memories. It's a direct port but the joystick controller is awful. I was cursing its existence from moment one. It's not good. I‚Äôm either crouching or just standing there pointing straight up. Shooting down a helicopter is incredibly difficult because the joystick has to be in just the RIGHT spot to move and shoot up at the same time. Lets not even discuss the metal slug. For a. .99 cent game I would be more forgiving. But for four dollars I am really disappointed. Hard to enjoy an arcade classic with bad controls. Just my two cents. Might just be me."

NOW we get into the responseablity (sorry I can‚Äôt spell) so here take the username free example It‚Äôs really unfair to the people who are good at making usernames at passwords and also people should chat at all ages and if you respond saying ‚Äúbut the chat is only for 12 (or 13) and up‚Äù then just improve the filters system by blocking out words like the f or h or... you know what I‚Äôm talking about. Last I‚Äôm saying the game is just straight up bordum I remember playing the fish game and I couldn‚Äôt reel up any fish even tho I was doing it correctly and I just have to visit people‚Äôs home to make money because doing it from games is impossible.

"4060",578203499,"Better than the $1 version as I can build cool looking bridges that pass the stress test and spend as much as it takes to do it.  In the paid version you are budget restricted. Nuff said. I agree.  Love it!"
"4061",578203499,"This game is not worth buying.  It was fun, but it was basically some of the same levels over and over again.  The amount of levels were also disappointing.  I finished the game after only a couple of days.  I only spent about an hour of total time. If it was a free game,  it would be worth getting it,  but with this price tag, you will be disappointed."
"4062",578203499,"This game is a lot of fun and it is realistic."

"4065",578448682,"This is a very nostalgic game for all the right reasons. It plays a bit different from the PlayStation 2 days but after a few missions you‚Äôll be cruising through vice city in no time. This is definitely worth the $5 and for all you GTA fans it a must have. ‚ù§Ô∏èüéÆ"

"4068",578665578,"Your app revelaed the biggest political scandal in the Slovak Republic history. All you need is to break inside (it took police some months to do it - you might work on more secure standards) of one of the biggest influential oligarchs who used it for long time. Now all Slovakia could read the messages and reveal the biggest political and economical thefts made by politicians, oligarchs, mobs. So big thank you for liberating our country.

"4070",579446739,"The Sign Off problem that was introduced in the previous version (2.261) has been corrected in version 2.264.  The app no longer displays a gray screen after signing off."
"4071",579446739,"Never had a problem with this app until the last update. Now I can‚Äôt sign off. When I hit ‚Äúsign off‚Äù, the screen goes grey. I wait, but there is never a verification that I have been signed off. I have to close the app and go back on to see if I am truly signed off. Some times I am and sometimes I am not. If I‚Äôm not signed off, I shut down my iPad completely and then boot up again. Please check into this as I am a bit afraid to use the app until this is fixed."
"4072",579581125,"I‚Äôve used this app for years, always loved it. It was nice to get away from all the ridiculous media coverage channels out there and see individual articles. However lately, the term ‚Äúbreaking news‚Äù seems to be exaggerated. I used to get the notifications for ‚Äúbreaking news‚Äù and it would be a key world event for a famous death. Last week I got a notification titled ‚ÄúBreaking News: Kylie Jenner Poses for Playboy.‚Äù How is that breaking news? I‚Äôve had my notifications turned off except for the 3pm update. 2 years ago I‚Äôd get one breaking news notification every few days. I now get at least 4 daily. Almost all are complete garbage social media articles about celebrity feuds or some other insignificant event."
"4073",579581125,"Hopefully this gets put in with iOS 13"
"4074",579581125,"The default news articles are clearly liberal.  At least admit it rather than lie. Just because I can hunt around and add Fox News does not make it a balanced site."
"4075",579712380,"This app now gets one star because no matter how many times I rate it, the app keeps periodically popping up and asking me to rate it.  To make things worse, I actually paid for this app. I could almost see the nagging if it was the free version."
"4076",579712380,"Love the ambient sounds and especially the brain wave activity they really help me sleep soundly. I do wish I could change the ambient sounds for the wake cycle so they are different from the sleep cycle. Over all I do defiantly recommend this app."

"4081",580765736,"This would be a fantastic game but it‚Äôs not possible to do anything because of the cost. You have to upgrade EVERYTHING multiple times (the highest I‚Äôve seen so far is 8), and the megabucks it takes increases exponentially each time. You need megabucks for everything. EVERYTHING. Sure, you could use supplies to upgrade, but where do you get them?? You buy them with megabucks! It‚Äôs ridiculous. You can watch a video every 4-8 hours to get THREE supplies...at that rate it will take months to upgrade just one building. This is the most expensive game I have ever seen. They sell FOUR megabucks for .99 (and that‚Äôs what they call a 55% EXTRA DEAL!!)...those will get you absolutely nowhere. It‚Äôs extremely obvious the developers of this game are GREEDY. I play other games that I happily spend money on, but the developers also give a lot for free. Absolutely not the case with this one."

After calling and chatting with customer service to get me into the game, I was consistently put on hold and told to ‚Äúgo to the box office to pick up your ticket‚Äù when I repeatedly told them I was at the box office and there was no ticket for me and they would not let me into the stadium without a barcode.   I found out my ticket had a ‚Äúbarcode‚Äù error. And so it wasn‚Äôt showing up. So there‚Äôs nothing I or the stadium could do for me.   I ended up standing outside the stadium for an hour and missing the entire 1Q plus more of the game before my friend had to leave his seat and come to me to convince the gate I actually had purchased a ticket and the company (SeatGeek) was having technical difficulties.   I have been reaching out to customer service for a couple days for a refund or anything, and have not gotten a reply yet.   Overall experience: 0/5 Customer service: 0/5"

"4150",583976519,"Cubasis ‚Äî I guess it‚Äôs an ‚Äòapp‚Äô, but it feels like a real heavy duty piece of software.  Lay out many tracks of audio & midi, use built in sounds & synths, and expand with plugins & samples.  If a sample is a different tempo, time stretch & pitch shift it to fit.  Reminds me a lot of when I first encountered Ableton Live (way back in v4) and I thought, ‚ÄúThis is exactly what I want!‚Äù  Thank you Steinberg - for some people, this is all they will need to make music, record their vocals, add effects, make a pro mix, and export."
"4151",583976519,"Picked up this app about two weeks ago and have really come to grips with the interface. It‚Äôs a powerful piece of software that allows for really easy experimentation and integration/connecting of many different apps including midi generators and AU3 and IAA units.   Lots of routing options allow for some mental combinations. Love using midi generators to control things like the built in drum machines and then recording the midi output.  Playlist is smooth, and zoom is fluid. Would love to see them add: -Time markers -Ability to rearrange tracks (update: added) -Group track lanes into folders that can collapse to help free up small screen space -Song sections to quickly rearrange song parts (intro, verse, etc).  Also something is off with the piano roll. I often find myself either accidentally drawing a note when trying to pinch to zoom, deleting a note when trying to move it, and not drawing a note because the draw button reset back to off position. Other than that the piano roll itself is fluid."

I also enjoy playing against others, and sort of like the simplicity of interactions or more like lack of them, which leads me to the following: not a lot of people are playing, so hard to get a Good/Strong opponent. Also, there is no leaderboard and from what I have read from developers there might not be whole a lot of support due to lack of funding. I would love for the game to reach its full potential, as interest in turn based games is there, just some minor tweaks and probably some investment into getting server storage for better profile, statistics and leaderboards to be available.

I wanted to do their free trial, but it has cost me.  Update: I emailed them at the link they sent and they offered a 90 day refund.  At best that will be $40 but it has cost me hundreds because they send no receipts, no notification of billing...    And I asked them about their policies, why not at least notify people?  and they did not respond.  The only reasonable assumption I can make is that they do not care if people use and benefit from the product.  Only want to make money?

I registered for a free trial and instead, they charged me THAT DAY for the full amount. I requested a refund and they have thus far denied those requests.

"4230",587868848,"The concept of this app is nice, but for $5 you would expect some actual nuance to the algorithm of the ‚Äúdartbot‚Äù opponent. Dartbot always hits it‚Äôs doubles, and it fills up the bullseye as easy as the 20s or 16s when playing cricket. This makes the app unbalanced, unrealistic, and wildly frustrating. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this crap and download a free score keeping app instead."

And so I‚Äôm going back to another to-do app that I liked and used in the past.  My biggest wish with this app, which still has not been granted, even though I emailed the developer regarding it about 10 1/2 months ago, was to set windows of time that are off limits to CARROT, such as for when I‚Äôm sleeping or working, during which times I‚Äôm not able to complete tasks in my to-do list. I received a response saying this was a good idea for a future upgrade, but that was many months ago, and the functionality still hasn‚Äôt been added (I read another user‚Äôs review that echoed similar sentiments). I just find it disappointing that I get CARROT in a good mood by completing a bunch of tasks and later find CARROT in a bad mood because of time I was not able to spend completing tasks due to the need for getting sleep or working at my job, which in my opinion is not fair. I really hope the developer adds this ability in a future update."
"4280",591840203,"Can‚Äôt really do much without leveling WAY up! This is more for amusement than actual getting anything done. You can‚Äôt schedule due dates or times, or schedule repeat reminders. And while the app will sync levels across devices, it does not sync tasks so that isn‚Äôt helpful. Unless you are turned on by poking ocular sensors and hearing Carrot‚Äôs droll, gravelly, 2 pack a day voice just use iOS reminder app or get something like Appigo‚Äôs ToDo Cloud"
"4281",591840203,"I love all of the Carrot apps!  This one makes me want to actually complete my to-do list."
"4282",591923366,"Handy utility -- I use it to transfer pics from my iPod to my computer so I can email them using my desktop mail program, which I find easier to use than the mobile mail app."
"4283",591923366,"This app used to work flawlessly, before the latest update. Please fix!"
"4284",591923366,"I used to love this app.... until today. I used to be able to easily transfer at least 20 photos at a time with no problem. Today I can't even send one and have it go through. I tied sending 5 pics five different times and not one came through, even though the screen said it did. The option on the app that asks to delete the sent photos? Better make sure they came through first or you may be sorely disappointed. Before today, I would have given 5 stars. Today, sadly, only one since I cannot review without tapping a star....."
"4285",592331499,"This app is by far the best editor I‚Äôve ever used! I have dark circles, and most apps don‚Äôt manage to cover them, but the filters are this app covers everything! There are also many filters, bunny themed, Halloween themed, you name it!"
"4286",592331499,"The best app in it category ! Keep doing this great job!"
"4287",592331499,"Please stop sending me weird click-baity notifs."
"4288",592682163,"This is a very fun and addictive game, I am a curler and I get very annoyed with the game because some of the rules are wrong, you need to add hammer rules and the order should rotate between teams instead of you throw 2 and then they throw 2. There are always room for new mini games, I feel like that would greatly increase of the popularity due to many winter games instead of just 8, here are some possibilities- half pipe, figure skating, bobsleigh, skeleton, and freestyle."
"4289",592682163,"If you are playing curling and after three rounds you draw, the opponent gets to throw last three times as oppose to your one."
"4290",592682163,"It needs a terrain park. Or a half pipe and online mode so u can play against people on separate devices. The terrain park or half pipe could be the same controls as slalom but a combo of taps in order to hit tricks."
"4291",593306620,"Worth the money, I think. Others take too many steps to get to what you want. This one you are one ‚Äúclick‚Äù away from the conversions you need.  Easy to read ‚Äì easy to use!"
"4292",593306620,"I use it for many things eg metric/English yard/acreage etc  Also easy to use due to double scroll feature"

"4296",593658634,"The older versions of this game were cool. This version is outrageously unbalanced; the enemy can respawn at an insanely fast rate and seems to have unlimited use of artillery. It‚Äôs next to impossible to progress without buying perks points. Save your money, download a different game."
"4297",593715088,"The ads are loud when they start. If one ad is muted, all ads should be muted. Some of the ads won‚Äôt even mute when I have the sound on my phone off. Very annoying!"

"4299",593715088,"Suddenly all the ads are for the NRA and building the wall!  These ads cannot be dismissed without accepting them and filling out their survey.  The games themselves are good, but I don‚Äôt need political aggravation.  Deleting app."

"4315",594851821,"It great"
"4316",594851821,"Overall the game is worth playing, there are hints available if you really cannot figure stuff out, but prepare to have many game overs.   It would be neat to understand more of why I need to do each thing for different types of bombs (some classes available after the first couple levels?)."
"4317",594851821,"The designers of this game assume that you are a bomb expert and know which wires to cut or what to do. There is no tutorial phase and it just throws you right into the game. The only ‚Äúhow to play‚Äù that there is only explains the tools you are given. In my opinion it is not worth the money spent to buy it."

"4343",596684220,"I paid for the app, got the receipt from Apple for it then I open the open to learn and enjoy...but i was told I had to buy the app again to use it. I really want to just use the app and live happily ever after. Help please!   üôÅ"
"4344",596684220,"I used this app to study throughout my doctor of physical therapy education, particularly for anatomy and cadaver labs. I sill use it as a practicing physical therapist to help my patients understand the underlying anatomy of their condition. Wonderful app! Worth every penny!"
"4345",597426372,"You need to direct connect headphones for this to work. AirPods disconnect the moment you press the jam button."
"4346",597426372,"This app worked really well for me and my family! Low key I thought it wouldn‚Äôt based on the reviews but I just adjusted the delay by increasing it slightly from how it comes. Nobody could stop stuttering while using this!"
"4347",597426372,"It doesn‚Äôt work at all, at any delay time I could speak fine. Might just be my headphones though."
"4348",597855590,"Overall, this is a great game. There are some things that could be improved. 1. Whenever I click restart after doing a game in ""single"" mode, most sounds disappear, sometimes all of them. 2. A countdown would be appreciated on all events that involve a time, rather than starting abruptly. 3. The glitch that bothers me the most is when I'm on online mode, the backboard displays a flawless basket, the ball clearly misses. The basket also counts as a flawlessly basket.   Other than the graphics' quality, this is a really enjoyable game to play."

"4412",601584735,"I played for a couple of hours and now it just crashes every time I try to play."
"4413",601584735,"So the reason I say was is THE GAME IS DEAD"
"4414",601831815,"I got this app years ago and played it once. So, the other day, I‚Äôm on hour 4 of a 6 hour plane ride, and I‚Äôve listened to all the music and audiobooks I can tolerate. I‚Äôm scrolling through my phone looking for something new and I find this preposterous thing! Two hours later, my wife has to nudge me to say the plane has landed and I have to get off. She thought I‚Äôd lost my mind, all the more so when I tried to explain the premise of the game. The thing is, there is no barrier to entry. Any idiot can play instantly. But there‚Äôs a lot to learn - rolled out at just the right pace. And no jamming you up for money. What a breath of fresh air! And the humor in the game is just the greatest - no small part of its appeal. This is just perfect for withdrawing from the world yet retaining the ability to rejoin, reluctantly, if needed. The best!!!"
"4415",601831815,"I love this game but wish it was not small on my phone. Black bars all around."
"4416",601831815,"This is a great game but over time it is really difficult to avoid fish while going down and by the second level it is too hard I can‚Äôt even get past 200m!"
"4417",602065803,"$0.99? WHO CARES?! Not me. This is so much better than the original. I watched the video for Cover Orange 1, and the oranges didn't even have stems! It's sort of hard, but that's what makes it so good! Such an amazing game, and it must have been so hard to make. I played so much that I beat the game, but there are going to be new updates soon...RIGHT?!"
"4418",602065803,"I love this game but in some levels in is really hard"
"4419",602065803,"ü§¨"
"4420",602716057,"It could not be harder to use. It contacts me all the time about my refills. It says I have one ready to pick up. I get all my prescriptions started at the same time. Dr writes them all the same day. All are for 90 days with 3 refills so they should all be refilled at the same time, but that is not the case. I try to wait until I have a week‚Äôs worth left so I can get them all at one time.  When I go to the app it has no refills and I can‚Äôt refill without calling someone. What happened to the refills.  I use to use the auto refill but it sends things I don‚Äôt take anymore.  This app is no help. It just adds to my high blood pressure."
"4421",602716057,"What a hassle you guys just lost all info the app does no display. I am finally pushed to go elsewhere"
"4422",602716057,"What happened to the prescriptions that were pending on 7/31? They just disappeared = no messaging or communication.   Bad enough that CVS prescription insurance requires a 90 refill but CVS pharmacies do not have enough product to fill and use archaic delivery methods that take a week to restock, but then the refill request just disappears with no explanation.  Also, my account had been setup to receive text messaging for refills and status but on this app, all settings are set to no.  I didn‚Äôt change them.  There was also a new script for eye drops that were pending since 7/31 = gone with no explanation."
"4423",603527166,"it‚Äôs lit no cap"
"4424",603527166,"I beat the game just now and I loved itüò∏üò∏"
"4425",603527166,"Haven‚Äôt played in 5 years. Found it again in the App Store and still love it. How did I survive without???"
"4426",603529731,"We need more episode like beach to forest I have a new one in dino times there are 4 bosses 1 brachiosaurus and it shoots fire out its nostrils. 2nd boss is ankylosaurus witch has a fire club tail. 3rd boss is a triceratops witch has flaming horns (P.S it can shoot bombs out its snout horn) last boss is a t-Rex witch has flaming teeth and after all bosses defeated you have to STOP THE METEOR! It takes all the water you have then you defeated the game! (Also they all are made of stone and all have red eyes) thanks if you reply! Oh and great game I give it 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000stars and that much stars for the other games I like!"
"4427",603529731,"Definitely worth the money. Easy to understand. This game has actually tested my mind quite a bit while still being fun. No lag, no glitches, no problem. Again, love it!üíñ"
"4428",603529731,"Stupid and way too annoying."
"4429",605040858,"I homeschool my 9 year old and we travel often.  It was a pain to not be able to use her iPad for schoolwork because of the lack of flash.  This app has made our lives so much easier!  Now we barely have to sign onto the family computer (saving electricity) and can do schoolwork more comfortably."
"4430",605040858,"Love being able to get around not having flash on my iPad!"
"4431",605040858,"Something told me that an issue that big (pages not loading) would be taken care of quickly, especially if it is solved in another version. No luck. Don't waste your money"
"4432",605057245,"The game is great and a lot of fun but it will not allow me to connect to Facebook so I can‚Äôt add any friends seeing it only allows me to add them via Facebook..."
"4433",605057245,"Love this game so much it‚Äôs cute fun and amazing just great"
"4434",605057245,"Now I know this game is abandoned by the developers, but this is such an awesome game. I just downloaded it yesterday but I am hooked. I just wish the developers would come and make more of this game and add more because once I finish I will be so sad to see it end. I only found one problem and that was that is flooz super hard to get."
"4435",605477810,"Love the app.  Not a game, but nice simulator to test loads.   I shoot a fair amount of air rifles as well.  Request custom parameters be expanded to allow for single digit grain weight projectiles, fps to the low 100s, and include GA model ballistic coefficients.  Also, allowing for distances within 50 yards.  Thanks!"
"4436",605477810,"This game is trash.I bought this game for 4$ and you should bay use to play the game.I would even play the game if you baed me 400$.You can only shout at targets."
"4437",605477810,"You can move you just stand there the bullet isn‚Äôt even close to real your scope only looks one way you can look left or right and you pick what animal stands there and when you hit an animal it instantly falls over not worth $4"
"4438",606190854,"Chinese control who wins, who loses, and how many teammates from 1 country gang up on you. You are constantly battling tanks with more power than you. Why are tanks far more powerful fighting in my league?"
"4439",606190854,"It's a fun game however whenever it looks like I'm next to a prize I should get another tank comes in and gets it.  Something needs to be done to remedy this."
"4440",606190854,"Each update gets worse and the developers focus all their efforts on making it more and more difficult to advance without paying thousands of dollars in IAP. Definitely not for the casual player, don‚Äôt start playing if you don‚Äôt already have a top tiered tank."
"4441",606310581,"Are you lazy? Do you lack the motivation and discipline to go to the gym or stick to a diet? Can‚Äôt be bothered to seek self improvement? Then this app is for you.   This app will help you get more likes and attention than ever before. Want to promote the idea of self love and natural beauty while you airbrush and photoshop your own imperfections? This app can do that."
"4442",606310581,"It is üëå."
"4443",606310581,"It‚Äôs very fun I use it to make funny photos with my friends we laughed for hours after words absolutely recommend it!"
"4444",606413051,"When I‚Äôm traveling and my husband is driving. It helps me pass the time. It also exercises my brain. As I‚Äôve had brain cancer."
"4445",606413051,"Fed up with all the ads"
"4446",606413051,"This is my favorite Solitaire App!!!"
"4447",606800657,"It‚Äôs littty"
"4448",606800657,"It‚Äôs great"
"4449",606800657,"This is a great game I just wish their was more classs and that they have combined class like revenger plus mage = blood mage    Or summoner and wr class = dragons knight or Valkyrie. And many other and I wish people spend more time on the game instead on line app if you‚Äôre a hardcore gamer you spend your time playing not on another app. If people want a great game download AVABEL and experience this great world and awesome graphics but don‚Äôt get the line app it have nothing to do with this game I don‚Äôt recommend line app for AVABEL. Hardcore gamer need to experience the game not just talks about it on a different app. The game have lot to offer don‚Äôt get hoodwinks into getting another app to talk."
"4450",607527020,"I found this game to get progressively harder in a way that just made you come back for more."
"4451",607527020,"I just complete the whole game and really hope they come out with new episodes!"
"4452",607527020,"This is a quite fun game, but the reason I'm giving it only four stars is because the free version only gives you thirty puzzles, which you can complete easily"
"4453",608188610,"Ï¢ãÎã§. Ï¢ãÏïÑ~~"
"4454",608188610,"Great site"
"4455",608188610,"Definitely recommend"
"4456",608206510,"Way too many click throughs and it‚Äôs locking up more and more. Have to either wait until the next day or delete and reinstall. Gonna delete for good"
"4457",608206510,"Too many pop ups directing you to other things when all you want to do is get to playing.  It is rather annoying."
"4458",608206510,"It is a good game. Interesting"
"4459",608707318,"It is good game, but I have some suggestions.  First, please make the ball more 3dimensional.  Second, please add more themes and better music.  Thanks for making this wonderful game!"
"4460",608707318,"Waist of 3$ , terrible, all I gotta say."
"4461",608707318,"Temporary fun but not worth $2.99"
"4462",608847384,"Great game, fun can‚Äôt put down"
"4463",608847384,"It‚Äôs a very fun game"
"4464",608847384,"Very addicting and great game a plus..a"
"4465",608899141,"I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT GAME AFTER CUT THE ROPE MAGIC"
"4466",608899141,"This is so addicting!"
"4467",608899141,"I have a idea for a new game for you guys but first I want to say i love all of your games I only haven‚Äôt played pudding, cut the rope magic, and my on nom but here‚Äôs my idea so I think if you got all of your zeptolab games and put them in a raceing game like angry birds go I think it would be a fun game."
"4468",609405853,"Why so Expensive for a educational game"
"4469",609405853,"This game is really only meant for a 1-year-old or early 2-year-old. I have ""Restaurant 2"" which is a good game, and I got this game so my niece could pretend to run a grocery store. There are only 10 activities and they can only be done one specific way. None of the characters give feedback (in ""restaurant"" the characters shake heads yes or no if it is something they like... they give confetti if they love something, breathe fire if it is too hot...). In this game, you can never do anything wrong. The game just corrects you. It is simply a glorified shape sorting game (put bottle in right bin, find the matching fruit...), which kids move beyond by 2-3 years old. Not worth the money. If I could get a refund for games I would definitely return this one."
"4470",609405853,"Do not buy this game. If it was free it would be ok but seriously I can't believe you charge people for this pathetic game. You literally do everything in the whole game in 5 minutes and I'm not being sarcastic no joke. I will never download or purchase anything from this company again"
"4471",609577016,"Final Fantasy V is a great game, the graphics look clean and sharp. But I am disappointed with the music, it loops back to the beginning every time a random battle occurs. This did not happened in Final Fantasy Anthology for the PlayStation 1. The character sprites also could have been better."
"4472",609577016,"Great characters, story, and art. But please add support for iPhone XS Max, the game does not go full screen properly and it just looks lazy on this device."
"4473",609577016,"„Ç™„É°„Ç¨ÊîπÂÄí„Åó„Åü„ÅÆ„Å´„Ç¢„ÉÅ„Éº„Éñ„É°„É≥„Éà„ÅåÁôªÈå≤„Åï„Çå„Å™„ÅÑ Êìç‰ΩúÊÄß„ÇÇÊÇ™„ÅÑ ÂÖÉ„ÅØËâØ„ÅÑ‰ΩúÂìÅ„Å†„Åã„ÇâÊ•Ω„Åó„ÇÅ„Åü„Åë„Å©"
"4474",609598558,"Yeah it‚Äôs a REALLY good app but... how is it different from the FREE version?? they are literally the EXACT same except one is 8 fricking dollars like really? really? i was expecting stuff like an alarm to where you have to walk around to make it turn off and more sounds that aren‚Äôt annoying.. also maybe the music is connected to spotify that way i can use my music to wake me up... but NO it‚Äôs the EXACT same so PLEASE tell me what‚Äôs different about the two apps"
"4475",609598558,"I am notoriously bad about not leaving reviews but I had to change that starting with this app. This app seriously saved me from being fired. I was a constant roll over and turn my alarm off without ever waking up person and my career was suffering for it! My work has very strict start times and I was showing up late and rushed all the time because I could never wake up. With this app I am able to set it so that I have two snoozes, and I love that you can limit them by how many you‚Äôre allowed and how long they are. And once they are finished I get up and go to the bathroom. I use the barcode challenge and I either scan my shampoo bottle or my tooth paste. And I might be a zombie for 20 minutes waking up but I‚Äôm an on time zombie and that‚Äôs what matters! I also love the random alarm sound feature as this keeps me on my toes because I really think I desensitize to the same sound everyday. If you are considering this app seriously give it a try! It‚Äôs the best alarm app ever and it will help you get up and get going on time everyday!"
"4476",609598558,"Absolute waste of $8. The app is identical to the free version, minus the little ads.   Would like a return so I can just use the free version. Absolute rip off."
"4477",609704981,"Won‚Äôt let me add friends from Facebook, when I try it it just shows me a blank screen."
"4478",609704981,"This app works perfectly fine other than the broken friends list. Every time I click on the + in the corner to invite someone, no one shows up on the list. Please fix this"
"4479",609704981,"I went thought a lot of effort to add my friend on Game Center, which isn‚Äôt easy now that it‚Äôs practically nonexistent. And I still can‚Äôt see their server. On top of that. I can‚Äôt even add them as a Facebook friends because that comes up as a blank white screen... this is extremely frustrating considering I spent actual money on something that doesn‚Äôt even work"
"4480",610391947,"Such an amazing game honestly a mobile game with those graphics , 2030"
"4481",610391947,"I love this game but how do you connect the DualShock 4 controller?"
"4482",610391947,"I really enjoy the game and play it often.   My major critique of this game is a logarithm they use to avoid compensating a gamer. They give away tons of items gamers dont use with the free boxes.   Also, could you find a way to stop all the hacking. It gets annoying when players jump so often in front of you playing multiplayer."
"4483",611071723,"The game is good but in the swimming and jumping worlds the training is horrible and not that fun but it good I guess"
"4484",611071723,"Pretty fun typical training game. Mini games can get tedious but payoff is satisfying. But game is too short, beat it and maxed out stats in one day. There‚Äôs no motivation to play any further, feels like a waste of money."

"4486",611436052,"I love playing this game on Xbox and other platforms. Unfortunately, I have encountered a bug on two different devices which means I get stuck and can‚Äôt move on in the game. The issue I am having is that once I get the swoop-bike accelerator I cannot go back and talk to gadon the gang leader. I click on his character and cannot initiate dialog. Very frustrating."
"4487",611436052,"One of my favorite games of all time. Possibly one of the greatest RPG‚Äôs of all time. Time has not been kind to it in terms of graphics cause they are pretty outdated. Beyond that, this game is one of the greatest. BioWare‚Äôs crowning achievement. I own this game on the original Xbox, an android tablet and now my IPhone. When I get my computer up and running, it‚Äôll be on there as a staple piece as well.   It‚Äôs worth 20 dollars. So 10 is a no brainer if you‚Äôre considering the purchase. Also, with Lucasfilm rumored to delve into the KOTOR universe, it would be very wise of you to familiarize yourself with it before they get ahold of it."
"4488",611436052,"I want a refund my game keeps freezing on me and it makes me sad"
"4489",613398383,"I love the educational material in this app. Has something for every stage, age and varying interests! My toddler loves the bedtime songs because he even puts himself to sleep listening to those songs! The only thing I‚Äôd change if I had to complain of one thing is that I‚Äôve deleted some of the downloads that shows material I don‚Äôt want my son to watch like the spooky stories and other holiday ones and he keeps downloading them. I just wish there was a way to completely block or delete the ones you don‚Äôt want your child re-loading off the library! The good thing is they do have a setting to download instead of streaming and I just have to remember to disable the WiFi so he won‚Äôt download new videos! It is worth the monthly due especially for traveling families who don‚Äôt want their kids addicted to YouTube before the age of 5! ;-)"
"4490",613398383,"I trusted this app and have been a subscriber.  There is a lot of great content on here that my kids have already watched on other apps (storybots, etc). But today my 4 year old started signing a song ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have a wee wee‚Äùwhile pointing at her fathers crotch area.   Sure enough- she showed me a video from ‚ÄúMonica and friends‚Äù where an annoying brat of a boy pulls off the pants off an angel, points at his crotch and sings ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have a wee wee‚Äù.  I‚Äôve yet to browse through other videos... but I really didn‚Äôt like any of the dialouge in the 5 mins of Monica and Friends I watched.  Whiny, bratty characters. Pretty inappropriate. It makes me wonder what other content are in some of the video channels."

"4492",613980069,"Seems to have trouble finding brown faces."
"4493",613980069,"Writing a review like this takes time and speech writing skills. The face swap function is the thing that we are looking for now let it work. Reading comprehension yeah lets do it."
"4494",613980069,"This is now the 2nd app I'm trying (free ones) to swap faces and I'm wondering is the apple crew is doing their job cause this one is useless too : can't choose 2 faces at one time so the app just doesn't work!!"

"4500",615256100,"I have the shivers!!!!!!!!! The app is free to find ghosts. You can pay to talk to the ghosts but you don‚Äôt need to. I would say it is fake but my dogs are barking at the ghosts!!! üò± I recommend this tracker because it‚Äôs so fun but it might be real."
"4501",615563599,"Great Tool!"
"4502",615563599,"I love Videoshop I think I‚Äôve had it for about two years now! I would rate this app five stars, but there is one thing I would like to discuss. Sometimes I have trouble loading my videos in. Like I understand some might take awhile but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt load at all!"
"4503",615563599,"So easy to use, fun to use. Ehh on the watermark but I guess understandable... maybe when you get pro? 5stars fasho."
"4504",616027251,"It is a good choice of a game to get but it could be quite a lot better"

"4507",616728746,"It‚Äôs working good for everything else, but pointless if I can‚Äôt save the photo."
"4508",616728746,"The app is fantastic, I love it and the pictures I can take with it. But it‚Äôs not working! I take the picture and when I try to save it it closes! Please check it!"
"4509",616728746,"Thanks to the developer for saving this app from not working with iOS 11 by making it 64bit!  Great app, I love it!"
"4510",617098629,"The app itself is good, but all of the projects that the the developers and the curators put on the featured channel don‚Äôt deserve to be there, and it is frustrating when you work really hard on a game and then they feature a gumball machine!"
"4511",617098629,"I got stuck so I left"
"4512",617098629,"Hi I love your game but there‚Äôs this weird bug where when I‚Äôm playing my own game it freezes my own creation freezes when I tap on something it doesn‚Äôt do anything for example I made a game called help the girl get to her home or house I don‚Äôt remember so basically her family members were waiting for her and she just got back from school so you have to help the girl  get home but when I tap on anything it doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs like the game froze but when I exit the game everything is working again please fix this bug and maybe one day I will give it a five stars and recommend it to my baby (baby born tomorrow) this baby will be born tomorrow and my sis will send me to a random hospital and I want you to fix this bug right away so in the future she/he can grow up being really really creative"

But then number of gems you need to expand is CRAZY HIGH!!!  They want money - hardly ever able to earn free gems!  If your not planning on spending money in your game this is not the game for you! And if you do spend money and buy ‚Äúgems‚Äù You had better spend them with he same session or you LOOSE THEM!!!"
"4519",619517698,"Trash"
"4520",619517698,"I first bought this game 5 or 6 years ago when it came out. It was incredibly fun, smooth and responsive. Fast forward all these years I finally got an iphone again so I got it from the cloud. This once fantastic game is filled with game ending glitches and I mean CONSTANTLY. I fail to see how the game runs so much worse on better hardware??"
"4521",619517698,"This game is so great but one problem, when you first download the game it takes about 20 minutes to load but other than that BEST GAME EVER LOVE IT SO MUCH üëâüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç ü§ù Great work keep it up"

Yo hice una compra y me cobraron otra m√°s, mande mi queja a soporte y no he obtenido respuesta..... Realmente me encanta este juego, seria una l√°stima tener que dejarlo.... Respuestas por favor..."
"4523",620112416,"*I really dislike the latest update. It‚Äôs frustrating that when you are styling and want to go back and look at the picture it instantly scrolls straight to the top.   I've been playing this game since it very first came out in 2013. I am loving the hair options and especially the makeup!! I really like seeing the changes to the makeup making it look more realistic.   What I don't like is that entering challenges takes a lot more money to style a look than it used to. I have to skip challenges because it's so costly. Luckily, I've built up my closet so I have a lot to choose from, but newer players I'm sure have to skip a lot of challenges and that is probably frustrating."

This is incredibly irritating, as I really do enjoy this game. If only I could get into it to play, I would gladly give 5 stars!

"4555",623789705,"Honestly, this game is really bad. For all you parents out there if your child really wants to play this game make sure to supervise them because there are people who swear, online date, and those things are just not good. To the developers, you should make this game much safer. I mean, cmon! You really did poorly when you were making this game. SO I SUGGEST TO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.           P.S. If you want to make this game better, start with the Chat. Make some limits!"
"4556",623789705,"I was having a lot of fun on this FREE Minecraft type game. Until I had monsters in my house (they come after you relentlessly) I died.

Please take this bug out of the game."

"4562",624533261,"Whenever I do attack mode in quick play the music sometimes stops. Would you mind just fixing the problem? I gave 5 stars because it‚Äôs still a fun game but the music being gone bugs me a lot. Thanks and have a great day."

"4564",625257520,"Blizzard can‚Äôt get it correct. They keep pushing bad updates and game play. They have ruined this game just as they ruined WoW and Diablo. It maybe time for a leadership change at the development level. Check out their own employee reviews. If you don‚Äôt have happy employees you won‚Äôt put out a good product. This company is trending down fast. Game is still predetermined, rigged, and garbage. Haven‚Äôt played in about a month and the game is still junk. Still really bad. Blizzard flags accounts. If you spend a bunch of money they will ‚Äúlet‚Äù you win. If you don‚Äôt then they will flag you to lose. They want you to spend tons of money because they know the products they put out are crap. Even tavern brawl is rigged. Still junk. Negative stars should be an option. This game is a steamy pile of poo. This company supports terrorists and drug cartels."
"4565",625257520,"It‚Äôs easy to stay interested with the new card releases and solo adventures. More strategy than a heavy game of chess. I like the graphics."

"4570",625411864,"This is not fun. I do not like that your skill levels restart. The archer needs different skills. All In all bad game.  AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! Oh and the add is better then the game."
"4571",625411864,"The first 60% of this game is a beautifully stylistic roguelite RPG with an interesting set of classes and abilities, a strange but intriguing storyline, and a punishing but fair level of difficulty which requires you to make your moves very precisely. I loved it.  Then the bizarro portals came.  The last 40% of the game is an RNGfest where strategic planning goes out the window and you just have to pray to RNGesus that multiple portals don‚Äôt end up getting placed close together and drown you in an endless flood of bizarro enemies. You‚Äôre forced to restart levels over and over again until the procedural-generation finally doesn‚Äôt screw you, and then for a brief, wonderful moment you‚Äôre back to playing the game you loved. Then you move to the next floor and it‚Äôs another coin flip.  I‚Äôd love to know how this quirky story ends, but it‚Äôs not worth wading through the RNG chaos of the last couple levels. The really baffling thing is that the first half of the game has spider nests, but the devs (intelligently) put restrictions on them to prevent them from completely flooding a floor with spiders. Then they threw out all those restrictions for the bizarro portals."
"4572",625411864,"Despite being adapted from a pc version, Sproggiwood feels absolutely perfect on mobile. Never crashes, doesn't drain battery or run my phone hot, and is both charming and challenging.   I've been playing for a week now and all I can say is that it's the best roguelike I've played. I love it"
"4573",625740630,"I thought it had haircut diagrams. Nope. It's so you can make your own diagrams."

"4579",625994547,"They asking money to send sms for vote - this is disgusting!"
"4580",625994547,"But, you can clearly see that it was poorly QAed."
"4581",625994547,"I‚Äôm in the United States why isn‚Äôt it available??  The app won‚Äôt allow me to view the live stream"
"4582",626362411,"I‚Äôve gone back to this diet multiple times but this is the first time I‚Äôve used the app. I‚Äôve completed 3 weeks of the diet using the app as a guide on my water intake, weight loss and an easy guide on what to eat on which days.  I‚Äôd say for the price, the app is ok. I would like a way to be able to add my own recipes as I don‚Äôt always make the Fast Metabolism Diet Recipes that are options in the app. And I also agree with others that for fruit, I would like to be able to pick more than one type of fruit. I also would like to be able to add more weeks as I plan on using the app after the initial 4 weeks is up."
"4583",626362411,"Ok maybe it‚Äôs 4.5 star but I was really impressed by how helpful the app was in planning the diet. Meal planning is a breeze, you just choose what to eat from a calendar and lists limited by food type and phase. I love the shopping list generation as well. I am a really bad planner and this diet was intimidating for my daily routine; the app made it possible, almost fun. The my day tab is also incredibly well designed.  Now for the cons: - I‚Äôm vegetarian+fish and I had to eliminate all meat items one by one; considering the number of vegetarian users, I recommend a preference to eliminate all meat (and all fish for the strictly vegetarian) during initial setup; - accessing the meal map tab, it should bring you by default to today‚Äôs date, I grew tired of browsing through the week every time (the my day tab doesn‚Äôt cover all functionalities one has in the meal map) - it would be nice if the app interfaced to Apple Health at least to automatically read my weight data  By the way the diet works like magic, couldn‚Äôt shed as much weight if I skipped all meals."
"4584",626362411,"This app is good for someone on the diet.  However, I think it should customize the serving sizes depending on what a person weighs.  A 200lb person needs a different amount of calories than a 130 lb person.  It should recalculate serving sizes"
"4585",626469977,"Support has to do something about multiplayer cheaters who start a game and then don‚Äôt play.  When the game is finished they wait for me to quit.  The game hangs and if I want to keep playing I have to quit.  And because I quit they win the game and get the pack of cards.  That‚Äôs real fair.  It‚Äôs happened to me multiple times the last few days.  So frustrating!  Not going to play multiplayer anymore.  And eventually won‚Äôt even play the app unless something is done to correct this."
"4586",626469977,"The game itself is very fun. The players and equipment are all cool, and the events held daily are fresh. Although, the game has many bugs that need to be fixed. There have been multiple times I have won a derby, and had to forfeit the match because the game would freeze; furthermore, it only seems to freeze when I am about to win a match. Another bug is the home runs not counting. I have had incidents where a ball goes a certain distance they will not count, and I do not mean the ball hitting the top of the dome in a indoor stadium. For example, I kept hitting the Cleveland‚Äôs Indians sign and they would not count. Overall the game is great and quality is good, but there are a few bugs that are extremely aggravating."
"4587",626469977,"When I touch to hit the ball the bat keeps on moving."
"4588",626583252,"There are still bugs...so I want to be concise about the one that is the most bothersome. When you apply a leak overlay, you CANNOT modify both the opacity and color, each time you switch to the other adjustment tab, it resets the other. For example, if I apply a leak, the opacity is automatically at 80, so adjust it to 50, and go to the color adjustment, immediately the opacity is reset to 80. Conversely, if I adjust the color first, going to adjust the opacity resets the color to the default position. You cannot even apply the filter with one correct setting, and pull down the filter history panel to go back and edit the leak for the other setting, color/opacity, because this causes even more bugs to spark, like the image saving without the filter applied at all, even though you can see it applied in the interface editing display. Between this and the other bugs, as well as the fact that my past purchases $$ were rendered a waste with the UI overhaul I have not been very happy about this app :("
"4589",626583252,"I will use this app time to time. Yet this time I went to use it and My IPhone 8 doesn‚Äôt have access to overlay a picture. Used to work ok and now useless to me."
"4590",626583252,"Great filters but after I saved my sharp photo in this app the saved image was very hazy and blurry. Compressing original images that much takes away from the quality. Deleted app."
"4591",627879091,"I‚Äôve owned and played all the games in the Sorcery series and loved them but I am disappointed that none of them have been optimized for the iPhone X screen."
"4592",627879091,"This game is amazing I bought the bundle with all four games and I‚Äôm into the 2nd game so many options to get through different scenarios you can get different results every time it‚Äôs amazing"
"4593",627879091,"This is the kind of innovation that Inkle is great at.  This take on a fantasy RPG plays almost like the pen and paper games of old, but with fresh graphics and a very fun and open spell interface.  Please keep them coming!"
"4594",627880433,"Based on the great reviews I read, I was really excited to play this game.  However, after about 5 hours of playing, I‚Äôm perplexed why people rate this game so highly. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any rhyme or reason to the consequences of your actions (sometimes you make a seemingly logical choice and you die; others times you pick something whimsical and get rewarded with treasure).  The spell book mechanics are awkward, forcing you to flip back and forth between menus to try to figure out which spell might help in a given situation.  And the storyline is a bit too linear for my taste, not allowing you to go back and explore areas you have previously been too.  Thank god I bought this game a couple years after it‚Äôs release, so I only wasted $5 on it.  Avoid at all costs."
"4595",627880433,"In the first installment, I felt as though I was really choosing my own adventure ‚Äî there were so many things I knew I was missing as I blundered my way through which really made the game feel magical and unique, and made me want to replay it to see what I‚Äôd missed. In this one, you have to wander aimlessly through a city, covering every inching and getting thrown backwards or killed at any ‚Äúwrong‚Äù step. You‚Äôre forced to collect 4 spell lines, ensuring that you experience the exact same things every time. I felt as though I was being railroaded by a storyteller who insisted on me playing through one particular story. What‚Äôs the point of a ‚Äúchoose your adventure‚Äù that forces you to choose the one right path?"
"4596",627880433,"I went over the four apps in my review of the first book, I‚Äôll just add a few things. Again Inkle has enhanced an old, classic gamebook and created a fantastic game. This second volume is far superior to the first one‚Äîit takes a long time to understand what‚Äôs going on, to gather all the clues that you need to succeed, although it is also the continuation of the previous volume. It can seem sometimes it will be difficult to finish it but it is never impossible, and the rich universe that lies behind the story is full of mysteries and twists and keeps you involved. A must-have."
"4597",627986929,"Please add this"
"4598",627986929,"This is crazy, get a alert every night at 12:30 am saying open. I had to remove it. Please try to make something that works like it should."

"4600",627994145,"I really don‚Äôt like hot sauce"
"4601",627994145,"This game is really fun but there are lots of annoying ads. Also sometimes it crashes when I‚Äôm so close to beating a level! üò´ And once I lost and I kept trying to retry but the game just kept saying game over! I‚Äôm lucky that it fixed when I reopened the app!! Overall, there are a few bugs that need fixing and ads that ruin the experience of the game."
"4602",627994145,"Look it is a REALLY good game. It‚Äôs great for killing time and it is really fun. The only reason I can‚Äôt give this 5 stars is because it is WAY too easy. I mean get this into respective. I got this game on Easter. I finished it an hour later. Plus the last level is too easy. It would be better with more level that are actually challenging."
"4603",628677149,"Great application with attention to small details"

"4608",629059031,"For some reason the buttons don‚Äôt want to register my fingers... having no other problems with any other apps, either the buttons are too small or something because it is happening very often.

"4618",632079234,"This game is amazing, because I love space and spa ships and things. But I would love for you to have an update that is a lot like Star Command Galaxies because that game seems to be a lot more detailed and interesting than this one. Still five star though for how amazing the game is, not in comparison to Star Command Galaxies. If it were in comparison, I‚Äôd probably give it a 3 star. So if you can make more planets in the galaxies, teleport to a planet and an enemy ship and Trade Stations. It would be amazing to have this game molded into something like Star Command Galaxies, but this game is amazing I would of course recommend it because it‚Äôs fun, (short), and action packed. I recommend starting on normal then when you beat it go on to hard, because hard is probably the most realistic since your shield breaks easier and enemies can invade. I love this game, so please listen to my review. Thank you for an amazing time and an amazing journey through the universe."
"4619",632079234,"This is a glitchy slow terrible app   How it got good reviews is a insane  Honestly I want my money back"
"4620",632079234,"Good game but there‚Äôs a bug or glitch where I crash after the Neptune mission. Can‚Äôt get past it. Very frustrating but otherwise solid game to buy. EDIT: What was mentioned above was simply my stupidity on not knowing what to click. Great game with a good story. Nice mechanics. I would like the ability to board enemy ships or land on planets maybe but other than that it‚Äôs worth the 2.99! Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes RPG, RTS, and sci-fi games."
"4621",632231181,"This is a great app. It made it very easy to follow my participants thru-out the race. I wish this app was available for all races."

"4626",632285588,"I used to play this game years ago when it first came out and when you had to complete each level. the game has changed the game a lot. You have to buy themes and it‚Äôs not the same fun that it used to be. There‚Äôs not many good features anymore either."
"4627",632297587,"Love this game but I‚Äôm very disappointed it‚Äôs unable to run on the new IOS"

"4639",632827808,"This is a great game, except footprints the bugs!  First, you claim we get power ups faster in challenges. You don‚Äôt , I checked it out. Second, in challenges, when you are trying to get power ups for the challenge, many times the game doesn‚Äôt give you the prizes. I just tried a challenge where I needed to get 15 power ups. I had 11 with 25 seconds to go, and 4 powerups on the board. I got all 4 BEFORE time ran out, but was never given credit for them, so I lost the challenge I should have won 10,000 coins, but got nothing. There are some other glitches, but minor ones that you can live with.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still love this game, it‚Äôs the best, I just wish you could get rid of some of the bugs!"

"4641",632827808,"Every time I use power ups or finishers, the game begins to load, but freezes about halfway through and I have to close the app to correct it. This results in me losing any coins and power ups/finishers I was attempting to use. Very discouraging."
"4642",633625517,"I never had a PC because it‚Äôs expensive to get a decent set and it‚Äôll be awhile before I could afford one. I love RPGs because they offer a world to explore and interact with. I heard of all these classic games of the Baldur‚Äôs Gate series and Planescape Torment. Once I heard they‚Äôre available on IOS, I immediately bought them and I‚Äôm glad I had the chance to finally play them. I was glued to the phone for hours and hours of playing the Baldur‚Äôs Gate saga. From BG1 to BGSOD (which I found more entertaining than BG1) and finally to BG2. I haven‚Äôt played a game this good since Fallout New Vegas. I just have one problem with this game. A year ago I had lost two saves when I was near to the end of BG2 and I knew I‚Äôll never get those hours back. I put off from playing awhile and waited for a year. I started to replay the saga and it‚Äôs great to experience it all over again. The problem you see is that I finally got to Spellhold and I got the hand of Dace. I went over to the kobolds surrounding the crystal and killed them all with a Skull Trap. By the time I got to the crystal, two goblins appeared but nothing happened. From what I remembered, there were supposed to be more spawn of enemies and I believe one of them carried the crystal I needed to progress through the story. And now I‚Äôm stuck at Spellhold. I‚Äôm grateful you guys were able to port the classic games to IOS and I appreciate everything you have done. What can I do to fix this bug Beamdog? I lost my saves from a year ago and ai REALLY don‚Äôt want the same thing to happen again. Seriously, I cannot thank you guys enough."

But I‚Äôm tired of working hard to get to lvl 70.0 and the game crashes and I had auto-save on but when I opened the game after the crash I was back at lvl 34.0 even though the game saved before it crashed also I had $15M before the crash and when I went back into the game I was at $0 and all of my vehicles were making $0/h then the game crashed once again.

"4655",634329875,"I have a bad habit of spending money on a whim; there are strategies to play the game and win (I won once) but unless you do not have strong discipline of when to spend and when to wait, I recommend against the app. I thought I could handle it but I‚Äôve gotten pretty sullen after dropping $15 already. I forced myself to spend the rest of my toreba points so I‚Äôm not tempted to buy just a little more for en extra turn; I only plan to use free plays at this point."

Usually I don‚Äôt have any problems with them shipping out my items but it‚Äôs been a month and a half. Also why did you take away the PayPal option to purchase TP? Now you can only purchase TP through your iTunes Acct, which is a bad idea because what if you don‚Äôt have that much left In There but you want to play more! I guess I‚Äôm not playing anymore or at least not paying to play anymore cuz I don‚Äôt really like to use my iTunes account to purchase stuff.

Why and how Apple allows this fraud in the App Store is beyond me, yet it has unfortunately become an ever-growing trend among greedy dev(il)s. At least give us old-time (pre-subscription) customers our money back since the features we paid for have ALL been unethically replaced with a subscription paywall and we now have no more access to the app's features than do those who haven't invested a penny (which is less than this fremium crapp is currently worth).

But they still make sense as you play along. Gorgeous world-building, character development and voice acting. Perfect game for those of us who appreciate thinking and creative challenges in their point-and-click adventure games.  Note to devs: The inventory set-up on this game was much better than the sequel. The sequel hid the inventory under an extra button push that got tedious trying out different items. Obviously not a big complaint but if the devs make another sequel, perhaps they might consider using this style inventory instead."

The bugs in the game made it continually difficult to focus on the art and story. Additionally, many of the puzzles did not make sense. As an avid puzzle game player, it made me disappointed that I had to rely on hints because many of the puzzles were unclear and unconnected.

"4747",642831690,"I would give this app 5 stars if only it would tell WHERE the picture was taken?!  Please consider doing that?!"
"4748",642831690,"Could be fun but every third time I move a puzzle piece it takes me to an ad. After a few of these it closes me out and I have to start a new one. You can have it!"
"4749",642831690,"Love these puzzles!!!    Challenging and fun!!!"
"4750",643165438,"I love Stellarium on PC so loaded this.  The displayed sky is very busy and hard to see on phone near Milky Way. PC version is perfect but it‚Äôs too much on phone screen at once.  Can you reduce this dense clutter."
"4751",643165438,"I used to have this on my PC a few years back. I miss being able to look with the different views (Convex, Concave, flat etc.), seeing somewhat hd pictures of planets and galaxies, changing how big the moon looked. I‚Äôm sure there are other things but those are a few of things that were on the PC version that I wish were in this. Anyway, in terms of a regular app, it‚Äôs outstanding. You should definitely give this app a try. It does have a sort of vr-like feature that‚Äôs pretty cool.      Hope you guys update!"
"4752",643165438,"This app doesn‚Äôt support Siri Shortcuts."
"4753",643496868,"I personally like google apps. Hangouts brings communication to a whole new level. I absolutely love the stickers. Very creative! Keep up the good work!"
"4754",643496868,"Omg this is so good ! I love this app I can call my Android friends phone I am happy and I love this app"
"4755",643496868,"Love it"
"4756",643791032,"The game constantly throws me out of the questions and marking them as not answered losing me points."
"4757",643791032,"I played 5 games and already had repeated questions. WHY???? Why make a game with not that many questions? Deleting the app."
"4758",643791032,"There are are lot of ads but the questions are at a good level for the average person"
"4759",643857704,"My app won't even open after I reloaded it.....there must be a big.....I used to live this app.....please fix it?"
"4760",643857704,"Agree. Not excited about the new  version.  But I will continue to try to like this version.  Preferred the prior one."
"4761",643857704,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a while now, but after the latest fix it crashed. I was on level 11, and now it won‚Äôt let me login. I‚Äôd like to continue where I was instead of starting over again. Kind of frustrating!"
"4762",644077827,"But it‚Äôs ok."
"4763",644077827,"I am Jon Lord in a Deep Purple tribute. This app is so cheap, I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. Although it sounds pretty good, it is not as accurate as the Logic X/Mainstage vintage organ plugin. The tones sound thin and harmonics are missing. The sample loop on long sustains and it isn‚Äôt a smooth transition. It‚Äôs fun to dink around with, but not good enough to cover the DP sounds. You need amp modeling, amongst other things, to get that BEAST sound out of a software plugin organ. I do have a real 1967 C3 to compare sound so I am well aware of what the real sound is. It is great for a 10 dollar app. I‚Äôd pay more if they could make it sound more authentic."
"4764",644077827,"Hello and to whom it may concern,  I have the 64g iPad Air 2, and I have the Galileo 1 app installed along with Beatmaker 2 and others. The problem I'm having is that when I play the Beatmaker 2 app the Drawbars in Galileo app move with the rhythm and beat of Beatmaker 2 app thus changing the sound of the organ with every rhythm or beat. Can you fix this issue in the Galileo 1 app please. Thank you for your time and help with this matter."
"4765",644106186,"I can see now why this is so highly reviewed. easy to use. gives you lots of good effects for free and others are cheap. but what really sells it for me is the fact i can play it with me screen off, or even out of the app itself. i give this 10 out of 5 stars.   genius!!!!!   PURE GENIUS!!!!!"
"4766",644106186,"I‚Äôm using your app for almost 2 years but recently app crack a lot and when I play a song, it keeps making strange noises. please solve this problem!"

"4770",644245630,"Great for practicing pronouns of varying types.  I like that I can choose my targets by pronoun type, and that there are two ways to practice.  Also, data on which pronouns were correct and incorrect IS available-- tap the arrow at the right, and it will switch to that information.  I like that the data includes which level was practiced too, so that if I switch between levels I can see that in my data."
"4771",645384141,"Cachly is my favorite geocaching app! It's easy to use and it has an Apple watch app that I like to use when navigating on longer trails. I just need to glance at my watch to see how far away I am without getting my phone out. Love it!"
"4772",645384141,"Have many friends who swear by this, and I can certainly see it‚Äôs greatness in potential, but since buying it yesterday it has done nothing but glitch and refuses to change settings (ie ‚Äòhide/exclude finds‚Äô) and repeatedly hasn‚Äôt been loading caches onto the map on startup. Settings are very detailed, but not all together in one spot, so it‚Äôs been a bit frustrating to try to backtrack my steps checking to see if I somehow set something wrong. Sometimes it shows caches, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, and glitched where it kept showing me my finds no matter what I chose.  A service rep was very prompt in trying to reach out and offer help, which I appreciate. Although I still couldn‚Äôt figure out what went wrong, I finally just reset everything and it seems to be showing the caches properly, but I‚Äôm leery of making any custom changes now in case it glitches something.   The map zooms in closer than on the official Geocaching app, and sometimes the navigation arrow is more accurate, so I‚Äôm just going to use it when I‚Äôm searching and want to double check."
"4773",645384141,"To tell you how much I believe in this app I paid for its sponsorship in the GPS Maze in Texas after its leadership turned down the exposure to 3000 cachers in the US."
"4774",645422116,"My daughter loves this book/game. She said it is the best and asked that I rate it 5 stars."
"4775",645422116,"My 5 year just came up to me with iPad asking me to write a review. That has never happened. Just purchased this for her and I have not had a chance to go through it myself. My daughter loves the other Slim Cricket apps. Keep them coming."

"4779",645682444,"So I bought a new phone, set it up, and thought I was ready to use it. Well I didn‚Äôt have all my pictures or anything else, all because I had to reset it multiple times during a 24 hour time frame, trying to locate my stuff. After I downloaded my Verizon cloud, all of pictures were there."
"4780",645704840,"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
"4781",645704840,"I used to enjoy the game on my iPad Air2.  I have been playing for a while now and I also purchased add free version.  My iPad Air 2 recently gave up the ghost and I purchased a new iPad Pro. I downloaded the game but it will not open. I have deleted the app and reinstalled it 4 times with any difference. I have also contacted App support but they have yet to send any response."
"4782",645704840,"This game is fun but it could be funnier"
"4783",645705454,"Cannot give this game enough praise for being funny, and well executed. Love playing it with my friends."
"4784",645705454,"Good game. Only one suggestion. Could you please make it to where if you snooze or quit you lose like 100 to 200 coins? It‚Äôs becoming a serious problem where people will just quit mid round. Please make this happen"
"4785",645705454,"me and my friends play this game at sleepovers, and every time i nearly pee myself"
"4786",645746786,"Why all of a sudden do I need to have pro to use this app at all?! I used to be able use the free version just fine and now I can‚Äôt. If you want to charge people fine but don‚Äôt let me download for free and then decide you have to get pro to use it at all."

"4788",645746786,"I am a new business owner & this app is perfect for my daily quotes that I post on Instagram & Facebook. This app is easy to navigate & has modern styles I love love love. I just began the new trial & after using all of the fabulous fonts, I see that I would not mind paying monthly for it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è."
"4789",645797558,"Edit:  zero stars.  The last boss kills me on their first round every single time.  How unsatisfying to spend dozens of hours playing this game to have no chance of completing it.  I have spent hours and hours losing over and again to level up, and I have tried every combination of character build, and I have never, ever gotten past the boss‚Äô first attack.  What a frustrating, terrible experience this game turned out to be...  I love playing this game!  It is not perfect (the dialogue/story is quite standard/basic), I am extremely pleased with this being a match 3 style puzzler without having to deal with the annoyances that come with ‚Äúfree‚Äù to play games.  The art style is very pleasing and I love the detailed characters and enemies.  The gameplay is great, with lots of variety in attacks, depending on how you equip your characters.  I strongly recommend this game"
"4790",645797558,"Don't listen to the negative reviews. I've spent countless hours on the game and it's nearly perfect (and I've played hundreds of these types of games for countless years). Fun story, good soundtrack, incredible art, top tier game quality, and super fun gameplay. They take match 3 and add lots of great rpg elements. If you have any interest in a GOOD match 3 game, you should buy this game immediately. 5/5 stars. I'd give it more if I could."
"4791",645797558,"I‚Äôve gotten a good number of hours‚Äô entertainment out of this. It‚Äôs no Puzzle Quest but it‚Äôs fun in its own right. My one comment would be the dialog GUI style and sound effects feel unpolished. It starts out easy enough but does ramp up a bit in difficulty but it‚Äôs a good challenge and you have to save up for upgraded emblems, spells and potions. You really do need to pay attention to each monsters abilities and ensure you have spells equipped to counter them. The RPG element is lost since your whole group autolevels but you can buy spells and upgrades from towns. No IAP in sight which is fantastic. I would recommend this game to anyone itching for a puzzle adventure game that doesn‚Äôt annoy."
"4792",645949180,"I enjoyed this game till recently. I‚Äôve sent emails and contacted support with no response. When you need to get access with a key to another world you ask friends. But, it won‚Äôt let you anymore. It says you‚Äôve already asked, when you haven‚Äôt. So it wants you to spend money to do it. Not cool! Hence the score. I already spend money in this game."
"4793",645949180,"This game crashes often. Have to reopen. That was bad enough now they‚Äôve raised the price of additional coins or packages. I would have kept purchasing coins before but their greediness has caused me to look elsewhere making sure I avoid same developers!üëéüò°"
"4794",645949180,"Watching ads will no longer spin the wheel for more time or prizes.  Ever since the ‚ÄúLords of Mobile‚Äù advertisement started playing a while back it stopped the wheel from working. You are forced to watch the ad but when it goes back to the wooden wheel after watching, it won‚Äôt spin it, it just says ‚Äúwell done, watch more videos tomorrow‚Äù, even if it is your first add or spin.  Once in a blue moon it will play a different ad and then work properly, but recently all I get it the Lords of Mobile ad over and over again.  What a rip-off, you are getting g paid for us watching the ads but we are getting nothing in return.  I‚Äôm on level 699 and I‚Äôve about had it, this ones finally going to the trash can for good."

Please, please fix the bugs...There is so much going on in this world,and for some fantasy is all they have...I just know my sons face lit up when I finally caved in and purchased this... I‚Äôve searched all over the web for info on this game...I‚Äôm so frustrated..I payed for a game that can‚Äôt even be played....so far the only version that looks like it works the way it should is on xbox360 and we don‚Äôt have one...   Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this                                               -Just a mom that cares"
"4802",646489967,"Not sure if the controls are the issue here, but this game is impossible. Not fun. I literally just spent a few hours with 5 people, trying to beat this game. Didn‚Äôt happen. Do not recommend."
"4803",646489967,"Game just crashes. I got iPhone XS.  Game gets as far as title screen and crashes.  Can‚Äôt play it."
"4804",646504584,"I'd like to use this app in my classroom. It would be ideal if you could import PDF files into the blank canvas so I can demonstrate the constructions on  the same worksheets students are working on."
"4805",646504584,"This is a great little tool. But it would be enormously more satisfying if it had some sort of relative positioning recognition so that the point of the compass or edge of the ruler or point of the pencil could sit perfectly at the conjunction of two lines, or a line and an arc, or two arcs... This is the kind of thing that Photoshop does well, not leading the user, but just tugging at a likely intersection... Otherwise all the precision is kind of wonky ... the ruler or the compass pin or the pencil moves a little when I lift my finger..."

"4814",647804489,"Mfs were accessing my Gmail without the app open, I'd randomly get notifications from Google saying that it's accessed my Gmail. Like why y'all mfs accessing my account? Ur a solitaire game dawg. Not my bank, fr, if that ain't sketch, ion know what is."
"4815",647804489,"It was absolutely INCREDIBLE to see at a certain point that I was actually going to WIN the game! It totally boosted my self-esteem... LITERALLY! I AM GRATEFUL... THANK YOU!!! xoxo, Elleüíï"
"4816",648019675,"When I play with my friends, it automatically forfeits the game in round 7. I thought it was because of the timer but we just finished playing.... until the forfeit and I had a little under four minutes on the clock! Please fix this."
"4817",648019675,"I have played this game a lot and I believe portrait orientation was nice and convenient. I really can not understand why developers have decided to completely remove it. Is it possible to make it optional? P.S. I have iPad Pro."

"4828",648998642,"I was looking for some interactive books for my twins to read. I was happy to have found this and it really is excellent but we won't be purchasing past this first one. It only took us 15 minutes to get through the entire thing including the interactive parts.  This is too short to cost $5.99. It's more like the first chapter in a chapter book for kids and is not a complete story.  It does not have an ending and you are expected to move onto the next book which also costs $5.99.  I recognize that they do have bundles so that you can get the set cheaper. However, I feel that the books individually should be priced more appropriately.  It's nearly $30 for the bundle of 7 ""books"" (more like chapters) and $42 if purchased separately.  If you have the money though, I do recommend them."
"4829",648998642,"I used to have this app when it was free and let me tell you it was soooooo fun, so one day I just started thinking about it so I found it and bought it, it's still pretty fun but yo"
"4830",648998642,"Great start to an incredible series. It looks like they just refreshed some of the artwork too. Glad to know they're still taking the time to improve the app! This is my niece's favorite story."
"4831",649181106,"Game crash every few minutes."
"4832",649181106,"Fun while it lasted, but my 2 year old had all the levels done in 20 minutes, so definitely not worth the money for such a short game. Just keeps repeating after you finish the 4 levels."
"4833",649181106,"My 4 year old, absolutely loves this game! Hours on top of hours of him playing with the different interactions of this game. Although, I did have to remind him that he can not paint the walls in our house unless he has permission first! I recommend this game to all parents!"

"4836",649246860,"Simple and effective weather presentation."
"4837",649822618,"I just started playing this game, and, honestly, it‚Äôs pretty good. The graphics are top-notch, and you can really let your creativity run wild.                However, there is one problem that I have experienced a few times: whenever I turn on the place/erase tool before I edit one of my works, the game instantly crashes. If this game was really cared for by it‚Äôs creator, and it doesn‚Äôt crash, this would hands-down be my all-time favorite game."
"4838",649822618,"I tried to erase a block and the part of your phone that makes noise stoped working the game froze and wouldn‚Äôt let me turn off my phone DO NOT DOWNLOAD AT ALL COST"
"4839",649822618,"Plz fix the game. You should allow players to have all the items when the player starts. Otherwise it's a BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! Stop the energy bar. But in a different view it's a great game."
"4840",649983655,"App was not updated to work with new iOS so it is dead."
"4841",649983655,"I have played this game a lot whenever I got bored or got nervous, and it was a great game for just simply occupying you. But now since the new iOS 11 update has rolled out it is now unplayable because of incompatibility. I hope it gets updated soon, hopefully with more levels."

"4844",650276551,"I went from not working out for 5 years to not missing a day in 90 days. Seven eliminates the most common excuses for not working out: finding time, traveling to a gym, investing in equipment, etc. I work out after I wake up before showering right in my living room. It also eliminates the uncertainty about what to do next, as it suggests workouts based on your goals (Fitness, Strength, or Weight). All you have to do is press ‚ÄúStart‚Äù and a workout will be loaded for you that takes into account what muscles you worked on the day before, as well as your goals/difficulty. I have tried everything: gym memberships, trainers, working out with a buddy, etc. Seven has been the only thing that has motivated me to be more active. More than worth it to pay the subscription since it is way less than most gym memberships."
"4845",650276551,"I wish it would give me more exercises without having the subscribe but otherwise the app is awesome"
"4846",650645305,"I think this is great for children like me! I also think that it is not complex and is very easy to color everything. If there's an awesome app this could be the one I could ever wish for! I really love it! Thank you for releasing a wonderful app like this!..."
"4847",650645305,"A just love this, it's really fun to play and it's very easy to color. I love it so much everybody should try it and see how awesome it is. If you like coloring then you should definitely try this app."
"4848",650645305,"I love it so much, Quiver is so good and relaxing you should totally install the game now. The app is very user-friendly and easy. The UI, the functionality, no hiccups, the API integration..."
"4849",650684932,"Helped me troubleshoot ABS issues on a Ford.  Developer question - Do you have a way to add multiple vehicles to the app so I can store data on more than one car?"
"4850",650684932,"Love this one"
"4851",650684932,"I paid for this after looking at a host of apps, looking for one thing. Read codes and reset the light if necessary. All of them display codes but resetting the engine light is elusive. Auto Doctor comes close but to add reset you have to subscribe. I am against recurring fees as much as possible. I finally found and paid the $10 for this app and am glad I did. Solid Support and no subscription fair pricing. Cheap insurance for an innocuous engine light when you want to be able to know if something real goes wrong. Plus there is a lot more."
"4852",650715760,"The app doesn‚Äôt use the full screen anymore on my X and looks like there‚Äôs no update"
"4853",650715760,"Love what this app can do... when I can get a new project to open. I‚Äôm tired of the ‚Äúcircle of death‚Äù ü§®"
"4854",650715760,"I love this app, but lately is too slow. I spend too much time trying to open something o adding letters. Also, often the app crashes while I am working on a project. It is so annoying! And the writing to the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù people is just a waste of time. Then don‚Äôt even bother to send you an automatic response."
"4855",651209536,"Yes"
"4856",651209536,"This game was fun and I got some decent monsters, but I had my Facebook linked and one day I went to log in the game, everything was gone and Facebook was unlinked."
"4857",651209536,"Hands down awsome"
"4858",651277515,"This game is awesome but as I said but please make a conclusive episode in about a few months from now please"
"4859",651277515,"I‚Äôve played a number of the Choice of Games series, but Sabre‚Äôs of Infinity is an excellent title that stands above the rest. The game is detailed, engaging, and genuinely interesting and fun to immerse yourself in. To this point, I‚Äôve only played a single title that exceeded this in quality, through choice of games, with the title being Guns of infinity. An excellent title, worth the money."
"4860",651277515,"An amazing game, looking forward to playing Guns of Infinity. Trying to decide which game I enjoyed playing more, this or Mecha Ace is a great problem to have üòã."

"4867",651510680,"Playing the Triviathon option is a lot of fun and good practice for getting better at answering fast and knowing what they‚Äôre asking. However, every single time I‚Äôm on a streak and an advertisement pops up and exits out, triviathon exits me out and says ‚Äútry again?‚Äù As if I just failed a question. Also the ads are insane and just plain awful. Better games are to be found on this App Store. Much much better games.  Edit: Now TriviaThon has upped their advertisements game and the ads will stay on the screen during a game with someone else, while the timer runs out, and the ad is unable to close because the screen is locked. Fun game, but absolute garbage setup."
"4868",651510680,"so many ads i lose turns and get hit with them even if i choose not to watch one anyways"
"4869",651510680,"So I love this game, play it everyday and bought the ad free (totally worth it) but whenever I play SURVIVAL MODE I get and error message right before it revels the right answer to a question. I'm losing out on so many points and wasting my free chances on the survival mode. Any way you can look into this problem? Other than that this game is hands down my all time favorite!"

You are my favorite developer of construction games but this game is a no no! I hate that you have to tilt it to turn. I wish that there was some more of everything. I want it to be reallisic plz. Please write back. Thx."

"4875",652039347,"I got this game thinking of you super fun but then after I got it I realize that this is not a really good game are used to have it done for some reason it went off my tablet so I got it back and everything was different I had to buy stuff with money that I don‚Äôt have to there‚Äôs some parts in the game that you can‚Äôt even do because the people decided people should start paying the money I love this game this game is like my third game time making new designs but it‚Äôs really annoying because now I have to buy a lot of stuff and I don‚Äôt wanna spend the money because I love this game but I need my money for other things and my parents wouldn‚Äôt approve so all I can say Libby is please please please bring it back to work it to where I don‚Äôt have to pay a lot of money just to play the game"
"4876",652077009,"You should add a new mode for friends to play. It should be local, or with friends from the Game Center. It would be a decent feature for Toca Builder. Otherwise, this game is great for kids!"

"4881",652138155,"Good game except as of January unable to restore my purchases"
"4882",652945710,"I just started playing this game recently, after seeing my friend playing it. It‚Äôs so addicting and fun! I like how it lets you know that if you want to continue an ad will play.   There‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd like to address, though. The game takes longer than it should to load. Other than that, it‚Äôs so fun! I recommend it.   -S√∏phie"
"4883",652945710,"To many adds and there long"
"4884",652945710,"üåπ...as a result of not being able to complete a puzzle there should be a option to go forward& come back to a skipped puzzle...this is My 3rd attempt at downloading this game because not being able to play a subject without stalling ..unfair advantage"
"4885",653031147,"The first thing usually I worry about is having an alarm that tells me what to do because that would seem very annoying, however with this app I find myself enjoying every time the water reminder tells me ‚Äúhey ! Its time to drink water‚Äù  - also - having the flexibility to choose the best time to remind me is key.  realized that my water intake throughout the day is under the optimum level that works for me - it has just been a week and I have found out lots of changes with my taste pallets whereby the more water I drink the better I feel + the less sugary and salty food I crave.  This app certainly is simple, efficient and does the job - I also love the animations they use and Apple Watch reminders, beautiful graphics. Being a bit greedy here -  maybe more of those graphics ? Cuz they‚Äôr amazing - I‚Äôd be really really be happier with it."
"4886",653031147,"I can think of many things that can be done to make this app more dynamic and adaptable instead of just a simple app that acts as a log and sends you preset reminders. The most obvious one is to change your required daily intake based on your level of activity. iPhones and Apple Watches log your basic level of activity (distance walked, flights climbed, number of steps) and many people log their physical activity into the health app using different apps and activity trackers. Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if the app accounted for that and upped your required water intake based on your level of activity each day? Other things the app can adapt for can be weight and body water % (I use a smart scale that automatically calibrates this info to my health app), weather (like a reminder to drink extra water on a hot day), and consumption of diuretic drinks as logged into the app. If the developers can incorporate these features into the app then they would really have a complete app that stands out from the rest."
"4887",653031147,"Does exactly what I want it to do."
"4888",653508448,"This is a great game I like everything about it But the only reason I put 4 is for the vanosgaming and his friends it‚Äôs just to much gems they should changed it to gold But it‚Äôs a very great app if is free to great game"

"4890",653508448,"I love your game"
"4891",653967729,"This app is amazing"
"4892",653967729,"This game is great! It does what it says it does but I would definitely like to see a kid section with things kids know. I am 9 and I don‚Äôt know most of the things in the categories. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me or not but this is a really good game for free!"
"4893",653967729,"Good game but could you add Spanish as a language."
"4894",654662054,"This app is great in theory but the execution leaves much to be desired. The stats feature doesn‚Äôt work at all, and it‚Äôs confusing and complicated to add tasks."
"4895",654662054,"This app is okay, but I had trouble navigating the app. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it looked like there may have been some glitches. For example, opportunities where I should have been able to select icons to add a task, or go to the timer, and tapping the icons did nothing. But they weren‚Äôt grayed out or anything‚Äîsuggesting those buttons should have been active on those pages. And if they were, in fact, inactive buttons and that‚Äôs how the app is suppose to work, then definitely don‚Äôt bother with it. Too complex."
"4896",654662054,"I hate this!"
"4897",654810212,"Honestly this workout app is perfect for me: I'm not an intense worker outer, I feel uncomfortable at the gym, I don't own any workout material and I've never liked working out. The stay at home body weight model is right up my alley. The intensity level is also spot on‚Äînot too light that I feel I've done nothing and not too intense that I find myself swearing under my breath the entire time and hating life. I am getting the cardio I need on a weekly basis and I enjoy the exercises and how I feel after. I've never enjoyed working out in my life! So way to go Freeletics. You helped me to like it more.   One thing though... The #%^*$&@ deep squat stretch for 120 seconds??? Every single other cool down exercise is relaxing and blissful and only lasts between 30 and 60 seconds. But the $&@% deep squat stretch lasts 120 #%^*$&@ SECONDS?!?! I need a cool down just for that cool down which is harder than the workout itself! ... Good grief.   Other than that, no complaints. :) Also, you shouldn't call yourselves Freeletics since there isn't even a free version of this app... am I wrong?"
"4898",654810212,"I‚Äôve started a training program and after completing the day 2 workouts at the bottom of the workout detail view it says 75% complete - finish day. But I don‚Äôt know what that means, and it was 48 hours ago so I‚Äôm not sure how else to finish the day?"
"4899",654810212,"I never wrote any app review before, but I have to point out this app has bugs when I try to register at the beginning. I was using my FB login, and it keeps back and forth from my FB to this app several times but still can‚Äôt move to next step. That‚Äôs really annoying me. Finally move into fill out personal info then the birthday I put in was different as it appears. Then I cannot move to next step again. So I deleted this app immediately without even know what it‚Äôs inside."
"4900",655890150,"Do not advertise for your other apps THAT I ALREADY BOUGHT in the app that‚Äôs $20. Unreal."
"4901",655890150,"After Back To My Mac was deprecated I was looking for an alternative to remote to my Mac remotely. Found this app and paid for both the iOS and Mac versions. Have absolutely no complaints, everything works as it should!"
"4902",655890150,"I honestly cant see myself not having it!"
"4903",656176278,"The controls are difficult for me. I am left handed, please add a left handed option"
"4904",656176278,"Pero los controles son malos"
"4905",656176278,"Is to addictive that I just downloaded because my brother like sports games ‚öΩÔ∏èüèÄand see him playing this game that I said let try it now I play more cause I‚Äôm a shooting game fan ....."
"4906",656723874,"Bad it‚Äôs not scary or really original. controls are wierd and can‚Äôt open doors"
"4907",656723874,"Home is a good game conceptually but spins too wide and open of a web to really capture my imagination. At the end you are left with essentially no reward for everything you did other than more confusion. I suppose their is a literary style that this is based on but the best authors like Poe still manage to capture your imagination, your horror, your mind and give you the finish. So in the end you are left with just your thoughts here instead. And there is no possible story which fits all the variables provided within. Please continue to write though. The App Store needs more unique tales like this. One suggestion to the player: definitely try and dedicate time to this start to finish. A lot gets lost if you play it 30 mins at a time. Good luck!"
"4908",656723874,"It was a lot of aimless searching/discovery and I never felt truly invested enough to care. I typically like games that offer a different approach, but this left a lot to be desired.   I encourage the developer to keep at it, but I do regret making this purchase."
"4909",656951157,"Honestly this is the greatest iPhone game I‚Äôve ever played. I remember downloading it when it first came out, and I just recently downloaded it again. Still after a year, I completely love everything about this game. It flows smoothly, and it‚Äôs challenge yet simplistic. Overall just great."
"4910",656951157,"This game is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played I love it it‚Äôs worth the price and is just a really good game there‚Äôs a bunch of thinking and problem solving I highly recommend getting the game."
"4911",656951157,"Thank you Martin Stig for complimenting this game with a magical soundtrack!"
"4912",656971078,"Do not put it on games that are kid friendly when yours is not kid friendly take this note surious"

"4915",657189652,"It‚Äôs a great way to track periods and symptoms.  However, after a year of use (I have a semi-irregular cycle and I‚Äôm not on the pill), it still fails to correctly predict my cycle.  But I suppose that‚Äôs the definition of irregular.  Would be nice if it were at least close at this point, after a whole year of tracking..."
"4916",657189652,"I love the app! Been using it for over 3yrs and it just keeps getting better and better with the new updates. Definitely recommend it:)"
"4917",657189652,"I really like this app, it‚Äôs very useful and accurate...the upgrade is a bit expensive for me üòß but yeah! If you can get it, go for it...I‚Äôll recommend it üëçüèº"
"4918",657395017,"I bought the board game to play on our next game night and decided to get this app to play several games ahead of time.  They have a nice tutorial video and good rules section.  If you are new to the game I would review these and play on the easiest level (one below Novice) which is unique to this app with less bad cards and is almost a sure win.  Remember there is an Undo button in case you click on the wrong button.  I have been playing on the Novice level which was a 50/50 chance of winning or better until I hit all four of the Storm Beats Down (SBD) in six cards which was sure death in two straight games.   In my next ten games I had all four SBD a few times in eight cards and nine cards.   It can't seem to get a good shuffle lately.  I just hope the game wii eventually get out of this cycle.  Having my Water Bearer die three straight games of thirst almost had me delete this game.  I really like this game and hope my experience isn't normal."
"4919",657395017,"Game is great, but can‚Äôt listen to anything while I play it, real bummer"
"4920",657395017,"This game has 5 different levels of difficulty. Level 1 you should win every time. Level 2 you may win about 50% of the time. Level 3 you might win 1 out of every 100 games so roughly 1% success rate. Level 4 and 5 you better be able to accept that you‚Äôll never win... Regardless it is insanely fun to play. I prefer level 3 myself, but get use to losing."

"4935",658257516,"I don‚Äôt understand anyone giving this a high rating. It works but that‚Äôs it.  It offers a page for tee times but then doesn‚Äôt give the tee times. Just group numbers and who‚Äôs in the group.  Useless. And somehow it just disappeared off my phone. By itself. The other majors had great apps. Why bother if you‚Äôre not going to do it right."

"4955",659672658,"I wanted to love this app. I needed it very much. But while it is good at the things it does, it simply is missing too much.  1. You have to use every box. I‚Äôd rather allow one info piece span two or more boxes. I don‚Äôt need stocks or news. But because I have to use every box I either have to use these options or repeat other info prices.   2. Calendar needs to list more than just a single days events. Option to have a Today box and a Upcoming box for events would be great.  3. Color options. The blue is wonderful, but I‚Äôd rather have it black. Only allowing a single color is not ideal."

"4979",662569685,"This is the worlds best racing game in the history of the worlds best racing games! Five stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è!"
"4980",662569685,"Sorry people / authors / code writers, etc., I apologize for not reviewing ‚ÄúRiptide GP2‚Äù sooner. I‚Äôm 65 yrs. old and I‚Äôve been totally engrossed in this darn game since I uploaded it. I guess if you people didn‚Äôt make it so good I would have done a review earlier. I should turn you over to the DEA because you‚Äôre game, ‚ÄúRiptide GP2‚Äù, is addictive and I‚Äôm totally dependent on it for a thrill, it‚Äôs a BLAST! I just got carried away with the races, scenery, live action waves jumps and everything else that I kept on putting it off, (for about five years) but here is my review."
"4981",663068211,"Wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if they didn‚Äôt intentionally ignore the user preference where I explicitly declined rating-nags.  What do I owe people who thumb their noses at my clearly-indicated preference?"
"4982",663068211,"The concept and general gameplay is really great but the satellite mission controls don‚Äôt seem to work quite right.  Four control thrusters are required to yaw because it uses the left/right thruster to do this motion. This can just as easily be achieved with the forward/rear thrusters utilizing only two.  The above issue causes several problems. 1) Uses fuel quicker. 2) Requires an understanding of center of balance when there are no indicators where that could possibly be. No weights or dimensions of the parts are provided much less an accurate tool to locate the thrusters on the correct part of the body. This results in unintended yaw when trying to maneuver left and right which causes unintended yaw.  Additionally, there is no way to turn the control thrusters off for other portions of the flight. This means your burning control thruster fuel the entire flight and by the time you‚Äôve aligned with the satellite you‚Äôre low or out of control thruster fuel.   Finally, the controls for fine maneuvering do not respond correctly. The forward button works as intended, tap it, hold it and the ship moves as you would expect. The back, left, right, and yaw controls don‚Äôt. You have to hold them down before that do anything, at which point they start burning hard, creating uncontrolled movement.  Add this together and it turns ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù into wholly frustrating.  I am loath to try the Simple Planes as I imagine it relies heavily on The maneuvering controls and would have related issues."
"4983",663068211,"I can‚Äôt wait for simple rockets 2 But other than that, this is amazing  Great way to challenge yourself to reach for the stars  In my case, literally, I try to fly into the sun  Also sadly my iPad is a mini 2 so it can‚Äôt run sr2 üò≠"
"4984",663547503,"One of my favorite games, got to wave 37 on my old phone. But I got a new phone and now it‚Äôs unplayable because whenever I try to move my minions to another job it closes my app or switches to another app. Please update the game to find a way to fix this."
"4985",663547503,"This was such a fun game. One star because it‚Äôs impossible to play with the way app switching works now."
"4986",663547503,"This is a great game that I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with over the years. The UI is extremely frustrating on iPhone X as it overlaps the home swipe up gesture. I would love it if you could refresh the UI to solve this issue."
"4987",664425773,"you morons updated this app now you can‚Äôt send photos from the scanner to the phone without going thru an hours worth of crap i am so tired of this i am going to buy a new printer scanner and this was the best printer i ever had but now it might as well be a boat anchor"
"4988",664425773,"App keeps crashing. Updated, reinstalled and nothing changes, it keeps crashing so this app is unusable."
"4989",664425773,"I have an iPad and iPhone 10 and printed from my canon mp560, I has worked amazing I‚Äôm so excited that I can print scan and more... great app thanks sooooo much"
"4990",664575829,"When you are supposed to save the little squids they don‚Äôt show up until you have only 3 moves left and there will be 5 squids left to save........ and when you do advance the super hard puzzles need extra bombs to win ....... then if you want to buy fish and extra tank decorations so you can max out on the gold stars so you can collect on gold and gems the tanks don‚Äôt give you any..... you are going to pay on the tank and fish but can‚Äôt win enough to get them......  GOOD LUCK"
"4991",664575829,"Zero stars is more appropriate. If all you have is an extra five minutes to play a game then this is for you. Don‚Äôt get it expecting to play while you wait for anything because minutes is all you get before your lives run out. Then it‚Äôs 2.5 hrs to get all five back. The computer makes sure you don‚Äôt win too much and stacks the games against you by making sure theres only one or two of the colors you need. You have the chance to win unlimited lives. When you do, you will get it at midnight when you don‚Äôt have time to play. Most of the time, you will be forced into competitions against 50 people where only the top 10 get a prize. The top 3 are the only valuable prizes. But good luck getting there because you won‚Äôt have enough lives to score enough points. Then you get demoted! They make it so frustrating and hard to win! I will NEVER download ANYTHING from this company again! Don‚Äôt forget they hound you over and over for reviews! Not just one review, they want hundreds from you! BEWARE!!!  Also check the developer responses! They‚Äôre the same for each bad review. Gosh, they really got the customer service thing down!!"
"4992",664575829,"It won‚Äôt let me get out of the game. :(. So as soon as I figure it out, I‚Äôm deleting."
"4993",664939913,"Rarely review apps, but the new update which changes the way tile connects to Bluetooth has pretty much killed the functionality. Everything is slower, less reliable, and I can tell I am not the only one that thinks this. I really hope you all revert back to the old method. We all hate it and it should be obvious."
"4994",664939913,"After they made the changes to the way the tile works my keysmart no longer finds my phone reliably. I finally pick up the phone then unlock it then tile will go off. Pointless."
"4995",664939913,"I‚Äôve had Tile for a while and I bought it to put it in things that I missed placed like my keys, my wallet. but now when you open the app by the time it takes to even locate the item and much signals it. you‚Äôve had plenty of time to walk around and find your lost item."
"4996",665001825,"For a very long time this was one of my favorite games, the story was amazing, I enjoyed the battles and evolving so many creatures. I was searching through my library so that I could find the game I remembered, Evertale has used images of some creatures in their ads and it makes me very sad to see it go, I wish you could update it to ios 11 because it would make me so happy."
"4997",665001825,"Please update this to IOS 11. I love this game and am heartbroken I can no longer play it. My favorite game of all time. I love neo monsters but this is so much better!"
"4998",665001825,"I used to love this game so much! Somewhere along the line though I decided to delete it... however, I really want to get back into it except it is now not compatible for IOS 11, please update this game."
"4999",665678340,"I just started using this app after recently leaving CrossFit and the workout options are more diverse with more options for changing things up than I‚Äôm used to.  I love it so far, and it‚Äôs super user friendly."
"5000",665678340,"It always show loading"
"5001",665678340,"I was disappointed because you feels like a trap to continually keep paying for more. There was no preview of programs. I thought I‚Äôd get more than one program"
"5002",665795633,"It's an amazing app that makes the booking quick and painless! Best price guaranteed"
"5003",665795633,"Coole App, sehr √ºbersichtlich!"
"5004",665795633,"I love this app! It's so easy to find cheap and adequate flights wherever you want to go. No more vacation planning without this app."

"5007",666202151,"Desde que la descubr√≠ me encanta!"
"5008",666508823,"Game is fantastic, dont get me wrong. But what really made me stop playing it is the skills and how they slowmo everything once you activate one. It becomes really annoying to a point i just cant handle it. If you could make an option where i can switch off the skills animation or the semi-lock slowmo effect of skills it would be great. I‚Äôll re-install it right now to be honest. If not, then maybe think of this suggestion for your upcoming game. There is just no way i‚Äôm ever playing a game with this mechanic."
"5009",666508823,"Great game but, I think u should update it.  Add more stuff and things like that."
"5010",666508823,"It is one the most quality game that I played on iOS. It is worth of every cent of it price. Really recommend it.  Since 2015 I finished this game many times and even recent years when I return to it - I'm still enjoy it! P.S. And is it really sad that game didn't get any expansions, DLC or any sequels."
"5011",666575946,"Could not take it anymore. Became to frustrating to use and limited"
"5012",666575946,"The app constantly crashes on both iPads, unusable, why am I paying for something I cannot use?"
"5013",666575946,"Not sure what‚Äôs going on with the app. It keeps crashing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled various times."
"5014",667362389,"Very addictive. Quite challenging."
"5015",667362389,"Me encanta la saga"
"5016",667362389,"Absolutely amazing. Enjoy playing this game. Thank you."
"5017",667579844,"Great"
"5018",667579844,"it‚Äôs a shame i had to wade through a bunch of crap apps in the measurement category before finding this one as this is clearly the only one worth getting. i was unsure about dropping the 2 bucks for it initially but now i‚Äôm glad i did. very well designed, great and extensive use tutorials built right in, works exactly as it says and incredibly accurate. i only hope adding another review bumps it up a bit higher on the search list when people search for measurement apps cause this deserves to be the first, if not the only one that shows up. well worth getting, perfectly designed, works very well. really this exceeds expectations and goes above and beyond in all areas. as a designer myself, i give the team behind this app mad kudos. good work."

"5020",667728512,"I played GoW fire age until It became to fast and glitchy. It was constant new drops and upgrades. Hi not catering to the big spenders(platinum players). When MZ came out with GoW dragon dimension lots of us started playing there because it was like the old GoW. The gameplay was more slow like the original GoW that everyone loved. But now it‚Äôs all about the platinum players and constant new drops. Game full of glitches and lag is crazy bad during events. MZ is losing players by the thousands daily.  We have tried communicating with them but they don‚Äôt seem to care. I won‚Äôt be playing much longer if MZ doesn‚Äôt try to fix all the problems with gameplay. üò°"
"5021",667728512,"I have played for years.  It‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs free to play, but requires you to buy packs to keep current. Every time something is added, glitches in the game follow.  Lag during major events, glitches, no notifications, and cost are big negatives. Every time they add something new, requires buying many packs to achieve. Packs cost for packs is ridiculous at $99 each.  Don‚Äôt recommend game to new players.  Spend money on tangible objects!"
"5022",667728512,"Played this game for years when it wasn‚Äôt all about the money. Now you have to take a loan out from the bank just to compete. Mz is a trash company and only cares about money, not the players at all. Don‚Äôt waste your time folks or hard earned money."

Please do not remove this app each one of ur applications are unique in their own ways  One more thing for the latest update on djay uv made that into a monthly subscription, please make those effects and goodies into a one time investment for the consumers and fans for instance while buying the packs and it will be a one time thing but it turns out to be a monthly subscription it doesn‚Äôt make me feel like wanting to take all that hassle and run a subscription for a hobby that i try to use daily but might use those extra stuff occasionally.

"5053",671464704,"I used to love this game.  Been playing since the very beginning.   Let‚Äôs start with this morning.  I waited about 20 minutes to be matched into a 3v3 ranked game.  When I finally got into a game, I was matched with players that we so bad(or trolls) that it wasn‚Äôt worth playing.   What‚Äôs going on? Is the player base too small for all the game options they offer? It‚Äôs a great game but I can‚Äôt wait that long and then be matched up with lvl players that are too good or to bad.   Please fix this. Get rid of the least popular game options. Hopefully that will offset the reduced player base.  It might reinvigorate your existing players and bring some back into the mix.   Update 9/13/19 I really want to love this game again, but it‚Äôs taking longer and longer to get into a match. And when I do the teams are so  Uneven.  9/18 update  Ugh  I tried to play this morning and it took 15 minutes to get matched."

"5056",671867510,"I love this app. It‚Äôs fun to draw and paint with. I have used this for several years now and it still freezes up and crashes. I really hope that the developers will address this."
"5057",671867510,"Every project crashes the app. No way to use it. Whatever update was installed just made it useless."
"5058",671867510,"This is a great app that I‚Äôve used for many personal projects and even school pieces. I‚Äôve done lots of drawings, paintings, and photo retouches. However, along with the retouches comes a drop in resolution. When importing photos in, the app will lower the pixel count to fit its minimum resolution. It‚Äôs a little inconvenient whether it‚Äôs for retouches or mixed media. So, the only thing I‚Äôd really like to see change in is the option to zoom into photos way closer; until I can see the pixels of an HD photo. This would also mean that the app would have to be able to handle more pixels from the high res photos. This is not an app meant for photos but in the case of art, I‚Äôd like to be able to better incorporate this feature through mixed media. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great app that I‚Äôve been using for a couple years. If you enjoy drawing or even photo editing, I‚Äôd really recommend that you buy this upgrade."

"5062",672002602,"As other reviews mentioned, seems a tiny bit off on a few of the puzzles. The design itself is very ... if you don‚Äôt get it you‚Äôre just sort of flailing without recourse, and the back and forward buttons are super annoying to use to traverse prior puzzles. But I enjoyed it mostly. For $3? Yeah, get it. An interesting look at a different type of word/novel/puzzle game. :)"
"5063",672002602,"The concept of the game is fun and original. The game itself is pretty dull. Not a lot of clever; not a lot of fun. The cute little twists all leave something to be desired, I think because the medium itself‚Äîlike a worse kind of crossword‚Äîis sorely lacking. The plot, which is really the only thing worth keeping on for, isn't worth keeping on for at all; it's a heavy-handed, childish take on a dystopian government, the sort of thing a teen comes up with after reading 1984. The characters are shallow, the Evil Government is boring, and the one attempt at tugging your heartstrings manages to be simultaneously melodramatic and boring.   This is not a good game, for all it was created by a great guy."
"5064",672002602,". . . but I cant solve puzzles with absolutely no context, writers. Subculturia?! Really? It just devolved into an exercise in futility and interrupted the story. Unsatisfied with a game I was so curious about for so long. I love a good dystopian story, but the gameplay was disappointing."
"5065",672150402,"Best mobile strategy game. DO NOT INSTALL if you have things to do at work. You will loose your job, be homeless living behind a public library or anywhere with free WiFi."
"5066",672150402,"It‚Äôs a throw away strategy game like all the others; however you get matched against players that treat it like a high stakes game of Risk. So instead of a nice quick match I get paired up against orientals that map out the attack, use slow troops and then delay the end of their attack for no reason except to spite me because I have defeated their poor logic.

"5068",672175251,"So I paid a one time fee for the app before downloading it. Cool  Then the app tells me in order to unlock the rest of the recipes I have to pay again Ehh,  But I did it  NOW the app is telling me I have to pay a monthly fee to use the meal planning feature  3rd strike Whoever said this app ‚ÄúNickle and dimes‚Äù you was 100% correct  Not worth it, the recipes are average too (in my opinion)  But to be fair I do like the layout of the app, and how intuitive and convenient the shopping feature list is"
"5069",672175251,"I thought I was buying a tracker, where I could input what I am eating with guidance to eat the paleo way.  Instead it‚Äôs just a bunch of recipes predetermined for you unless you want to pay AGAIN!  I‚Äôm disappointed for sure."

"5071",672828590,"You know this game is rigged when your ball goes in the complete wrong direction than how it was hit. Getting fed up with these rigged games, class actions need to be considered against all of these that CHEAT. I‚Äôm recording games and the discrepancies. Just FYI. For proof of foul play."
"5072",672828590,"Could be fun but, after short training, there is nowhere to practice and perfect you skills. Start playing and you go against higher skilled players. Example: As a new  just downloaded player, I played just two days, got to Level 8. I tried to play today, and get matched up against Level 97? This is every game I play, go against much much more skilled levels. Higher skilled players know more of what they are doing, I am still fumbling with how to do things...Doesn‚Äôt seem quite fair. Also, I‚Äôve earned coin that I can‚Äôt figure out what to do with it. To upgrade to better clubs, balls, etc, you need to spend real $. Why do that when I don‚Äôt know how best to use them??"

"5083",673673795,"The""Buy Pro"" nag is REALLY IRRITATING! Lowering review because of this.   Changed to feet in iPhone settings. Worked for a little bit then changed itself back.   I can't fix a room so now I'm trying to delete it. How do I do that?!!!  Learning curve is steep. Edits are not natural. Rooms attach at wrong place and couldn't figure out how to fix it. Very frustrating."
"5084",673673795,"Not sure how to use it, but can see very real world possibilities"
"5085",673673795,"I really like the idea of this app.  Measure a room and then create a 3d model using pictures of the actual room.  Reason I can‚Äôt give it more than 2 stars right now are: * Learning curve.  Tough to figure out how things work without spending a lot of time figuring it out * 3D picture map stops working half way through.  Starts off really fast and then just stops collecting pictures and I end up with an unusable 3D model.  Maybe not enough memory being allocated for the rendering of the pictures?  I would rather have a full room at less resolution than 6 square feet of useless high quality floor pictures. * Wish it was a little more accurate in measuring.  I don‚Äôt expect it to ever replace my trusty laser measurer but it is sometime off by more than a foot.  Also never gets room height correct."

Like, when I go to change the skin, I‚Äôll tap the picture and the little thing will pop up, but it‚Äôs invisible. And it doesn‚Äôt show up when you select the skin, it‚Äôll just keep the skin you had previously on. Which I guess wouldn‚Äôt be THAT bad, but you have to watch an ad Every. Single. Time you save/export it. I can deal with some ads, that‚Äôs understandable, it‚Äôs just every single time can get annoying. Also, you REALLY need some more child safe precautions here. I haven‚Äôt seen anything really bad yet, but in other reviews I‚Äôve seen, it can get bad. Maybe also add in a way so where you can report stuff? It‚Äôs mostly children that will use this app, so please pay more attention to that. It‚Äôs a really big issue. But, besides that, this is a really good app"

"5108",679753195,"The new format started cute and fun, but I have pretty much lost interest because some sets are almost impossible. You buy 50 packs in a row on A 1:8 and you get none??? Very very disappointed. And that's happened more than once. Then you end up with 20 dups of the same base and no way to trade them up like other topps apps. Just to frustrating.  Update: same odds issue persists in the 18/19 release.   Update: Kick 20 is another epic letdown. Having thousand of EPL cards to trade ... but you can‚Äôt trade them. No explanation on why that is, though we all know topps lost the rights.  That totally stinks. Ok, no new cards but not allowed to trade old ones???  I really pitty the fools that spent real money on those.   The trade feed is drying up.  This app might be into a slow death spiral."

"5122",680366065,"Engaging, beautifully designed, very challenging puzzle and logic game.  Fascinating plot, if not a bit twisted.  You should definitely buy this game!"
"5123",680366065,"I gave it 4 stars so I did quite like it despite what I am going to write.  First, gorgeously done with regard to the linking of narrative and movement. Best part of the game. But I use the word ‚Äúgame‚Äù guardedly (which I suspect the authors might agree with). If you are looking for The Room level puzzles, this is not the place. Some clever mechanics but not overly challenging.  Second, the audio is wonderfully done and adds a wonderful richness to the experience.  Lastly, the ending is weak. I am not sure if there is more than 1 ending so I was going to go through it again. But the one I got was less than satisfying. There are plenty of common tropes that could have worked better.  So in summary, a as game it is so-so, as an experience it is excellent."
"5124",680366065,"This game is amazing and you should get it. Review done. üòÅ  Need more?  I LOVE these kinds of games and play as many as I can.  This game entranced me like no other game has been able to do. The storytelling is great and gameplay is the most unique I‚Äôve ever played.  The puzzles were the perfect level of difficulty.   Enough gushing. Just play it."
"5125",680733772,"This game is great stuff but there‚Äôs a map that always lags out for me plz fix this but otherwise this app is a great üëçüèº game and the graphics are absolutely amazing this game must have a great graphic artist I hope this game will be the best game on the whole App Store but again please fix this lag"
"5126",680733772,"I got this game for my Apple TV because it looked interesting and I was bored, plus I had the controller so why not? It didn‚Äôt take long for me to realize that it plays and works EXACTLY like Contest of Champions, the RNG factor of obtaining heroes the ‚Äúquests‚Äù that require energy and single round one on one combat that is punch kick to build your power until you can use a skill that actually relates to the character and what they are known for. The fact that I can own 4 versions of the same chapter because of how many stars it has and the fact I can‚Äôt promote a two star to a three star, I just have to hope my next crystal, I mean orb, gives me the higher star version of the character I want. Quest exploration, quest completion, chapter and act completion rewards, iso-8 to level up your character.... oops I mean Ichor, that comes in 75, 125 and higher values to provide more xp. I do not like this set up at all, in fact I rage quit MCOC after I idiotically spent $100 trying to get a specific 4 star character because I could let rank high enough in PvP Tournaments to earn it, and got nothing but 2 and 3 star rat feces characters.... I‚Äôm older and wiser now and have no real investment in these characters so that part is fine, but I don‚Äôt actually like the game play.... its ridiculous that Zeus slaps you about a bit before he‚Äôs even capable of chunking some lightning at you. And when it happens you just mash a button... no combos like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter (‚¨áÔ∏è‚ÜòÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è) just hit Y and it does the special attack for you... no skill or practice needed just button mash and block on time. I prefer the game play in Marvel Future Fight, where skips are always available for you to use, even if they have a cool down. Anyway, I will say I like the ‚Äúgraphics‚Äù for this better because they aren‚Äôt afraid of a little skin, no matter who you like to look at. That being said, if you like the game style of Marvel‚Äôs Contest of Champions, or you are familiar with it, when you play this you‚Äôll see it is literally just a new skin for that exact very game, I forgot to mention class bonuses, and colors, it‚Äôs literally a photo copy Of that game down to the minute detail... oddly enough from a different developer: Gameloft vs Kabam, did someone get fired and go work for Gameloft?). If you like that game, which I don‚Äôt, then you‚Äôll like this."

I choose to stick to clean language, and the ‚ÄúG‚Äù bomb at the end (along with a few other instances) puts drag on the overall experience.  A lot of major films do this‚Äîa lot of writers feel that it adds potency to a moment to drop profanity. I do understand that my preference differs from that of others, and I respect the right of others to express themselves how they choose.  That said, and aside from the profanity, R√©publique deserves all the success it can stand, and Camoflaj and Logan games deserve a thick paycheck and kudos.  Well done, except for the kitchen sink!"
"5171",687888390,"I actually enjoyed this game. And I liked just as much when I had a few years back."
"5172",687888390,"Hey developers!!! I LOVE this game! Played through episode 1, and have absolutely loved it. Didn‚Äôt have any problems, that is, until I tried to start up episode 2. It let me watch the short clip, but the moment I click on the camera to move from the phone to the rest of the game, it quits. I don‚Äôt lose my progress, but I haven‚Äôt been able to progress any further. Again, love the game, and I‚Äôll change my review to a 5 star as soon as the bug has been fixed. Thanks for creating such an awesome game. Please, please, PLEASE fix this."
"5173",688285246,"Bought this one a while back and completed it once. Picked it back up recently and I can honestly say that I have no idea why I put it down. The combat is challenging but not overdone, the story is genuinely enjoyable and, well I just liked the game."
"5174",688285246,"I‚Äôm in love"
"5175",688285246,"This is a fun J-RPG with a lot of humor and many pop/video game references.  If you wanna play a turn based RPG that doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously, give this a go!"
"5176",688319243,"Handy app for creating collages and other graphic designs.  I‚Äôm giving it 5 stars only because developers (very helpful) tell me landscape mode (for iPad use) is in the works.  Especially love that my videos keep the audio when attached to a collage.  I upgraded for one-time fee to support developers and because I hate subscriptions."
"5177",688319243,"This app used to be awesome but since the updates it crashes during editing constantly.  This NEEDS to be fixed immediately. I‚Äôm on an iPhone XS Max OS 12.4  I would recommend it, but until it stops crashing, I am unsure why I am paying for it."
"5178",688319243,"Your compression (that‚Äôs new) is killing the quality of photo. Also when you save, it takes like 15 seconds now for the app to become responsive."
"5179",688831692,"Love this app...I use it on my iPhone with all the great feature but decided to download it on my iPad and thought I was getting the same thing or even more feature ...NO... I was sadly mistaken. The app on the iPad had less feature and cost $5.99 compared to what I paid for the phone version which was $3.99. Please add more features or at least what your phone version have. I REALLY WANT THIS UPDATED ASAP"
"5180",688831692,"I absolutely love Facetune! I‚Äôve used it to edit everything from fashion shots to landscape photography, and the results are phenomenal every time!  One of my favorite things about Facetune is the control it gives you over every tool. Many apps these days have a sort of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù function that tries to apply it for you, resulting in over- or under-application more often than not. Facetune, on the other hand, lets you hand-select where to apply any tool, as well as the strength, which allows for more natural-looking edits that, honestly, look better. Overall, this is well-worth the money and I would recommend!"
"5181",688831692,"I buy the app with all these features, they update it and remove all the neat features that made me want to buy it. I want a refund!"
"5182",688983474,"132üòé"
"5183",688983474,"finally took this test for the 1st time ever & my last...i thought the questions would be about the world/history/science/match etc... & that i would probably get a low score..so answered them honestly, no paper/pen/checking online...scored 134üò±üò±üò±... should have taken this at night when my 9month old baby is in bed but overall i am very happy with the results...highly recommended...thanks!!!"
"5184",688983474,"It was genuinely easy at first and then really difficult towards the end."
"5185",689165391,"Love the no ads and learning portion of the app but don‚Äôt think LGBT needs to be shoved down my 4 year olds throat. I need to watch a littler closer when she‚Äôs on this app because when she should be innocently learning she‚Äôs instead asking questions that her little mind isn‚Äôt yet ready for."
"5186",689165391,"Keeping an extremely active four year old grandchild when you are over seventy can be quite a challenge. He loves HOPSTER and the programs are very good. We watch it together as we take a much needed break, several times a day."

"5192",689859603,"Great app"
"5193",689859603,"Love this app. Have made several little shows and always get wonderful compliments from my friends and family on them."
"5194",689936776,"I think this is a good game, but I think it should be free. There‚Äôs not that much to do but knock things over and build our own town using the toys they already have. It‚Äôs not worth buying this game."
"5195",689936776,"#1 it‚Äôs a pretty small map.  #2 you can‚Äôt build very much.  #3 you don‚Äôt have a very good view when your in the car so you can‚Äôt see were your going.  #4 when you touch the trash can to delete stuff it zooms in so you can‚Äôt see very much.  #5 not much to do it‚Äôs just kinda boring.  #6 needs better controls.  But other than those things the animation is pretty good"
"5196",689936776,"Needs a lot of work and please let me design my own house and car maybe demolition derbies"

"5200",690602681,"For some reason the JD doesn‚Äôt load anything when I download it or reinstall it. It used to work perfectly, but it‚Äôs been over a month now. Dissatisfied with that app."
"5201",690602681,"Ordered using the App twice in the last few weeks , buying three items.  Easy to use and fast.  And great sale items.  (England uk)"
"5202",690602681,"Great app."
"5203",690802539,"Would be a great app if the sound worked."
"5204",690802539,"I was hoping to have my son practice listening to sounds but it‚Äôs not working. I hope you could fix this. Seems like the intention in creating this app is great but the app itself crashes."
"5205",690802539,"It seems like a good idea but I wish it was a big better. My ENL student gets confused when he slices a letter and the game says a letter that‚Äôs different from what he sliced. I agree. It‚Äôs good, but could be better."
"5206",690852527,"I started playing your game Cascade several years back I loved it . but when it ask me to watch a movie for different rewards I would watch the movie  , then after I watch the movie the frame froze up and I would have to exit the game to get it to unfreeze. And no reward.  So I quit playing for a long time. I just started up again playing. But the same problem would happen over and over again. It‚Äôs to bad Cascade was my favorite game."
"5207",690852527,"I‚Äôve played this game for years and have loved it. Over the past couple of months, though, the game makes me load new content and then load my progress (separately) EVERY TIME I load the game. This means I have to waste time several times a day. It also won‚Äôt load if I‚Äôm not on great WiFi. I‚Äôve started migrating to other games to play because of this. Fix it, and I‚Äôll be back..."
"5208",690852527,"I‚Äôve played this game for years and I am currently on level 1598. It has always been slow to load but  I have excepted this. But now the game is lagging and it can take several minutes to complete one move that would usually take seconds. The only way to get around this is to exit game and go back in which means that you lose your progress on that level.  At this time it is unplayable"
"5209",691102150,"This game is like temple run but not really and I like this game because this is so much fun to play"
"5210",691102150,"There was a finish platform at 7:28 and it then didn't record that I beat my old record of 6:20"
"5211",691102150,"The swipe controls while responsive take time. Which is good for early levels in classic but is terrible for later ones as the speed is increased The tap controls are absolutely terrible. Tapping one side of the screen should send you that side but if you miss the absolute side you are sent flipping. Simply put the tap controls are too unforgiving with switching lanes The computer version is the definitive version as the controls are solid and it works for people who left and right handed perfectly I would have thought that with the CPU version we would not have crappy controls in the phone version. Advice make an update where tapping both sides of the screen flips the map not the center and give complete lane switching to tapping one side of the screen."
"5212",691121579,"Doesn‚Äôt even block ads that take you to different sites. You‚Äôll try to click on a video to watch it and  another tab opens up talking about non-sense. Waste of money does not work"

"5215",691797987,"I have been using this app a lot for school while doing my work great app. I want to see it for the Apple Watch and Fitbit"
"5216",691797987,"Missing some key feature for no reason compared to the Android version. Two most notable are the ability to re-arrange your queue and the Equalizer. I also constantly experience crashing after a few weeks of use. Clearing the cache doesn't fix it; I always have to uninstall and reinstall the app. In CarPlay it's unusable. The nav doesn't even show up about 80%+ of the time. If you tap where a nav item should be you get an error message about ""(null)."" (I don't remember the exact message but that's part of it), there's no way to view the queue, no way to shuffle or repeat, no way to thumbs up or down, and when you select a playlist - on the rare occasion the nav works - the playlist fails to load if it has more than a couple handfuls of songs. Basically you have to use the app on your phone if you're going to use Play Music because it doesn't work in CarPlay and when it does it's so limited you can't do what you wanted to do anyway."
"5217",691797987,"I‚Äôm starting to dislike this app more and more. You can‚Äôt easily organize things and more importantly, songs keep getting deleted from my library without my knowledge. I‚Äôm sick of it. I don‚Äôt know how many songs I‚Äôm missing now. I‚Äôm switching to Spotify or something"
"5218",692412579,"Bonus levels are too hard to win.   It‚Äôs impossible to earn bonuses for building the town."
"5219",692412579,"I enjoy the game and enjoy the side games in Arendelle.  But, when it comes to Elsa‚Äôs special games it is really frustrating. I won‚Äôt use any of my power ups nor waste my extra lives because the developers have made those games impossible to complete.  I love trying the games but when you make it to level 4 and lose and have to start at the beginning, makes me not want to play them."
"5220",692412579,"This game is sooo much less annoying than candy crush!  It‚Äôs the same basic idea, but it‚Äôs way better!  Love it!"
"5221",692669501,"The game charged me 49.99 and then tried to charge me 99.99 and I quickly closed it to prevent it from charging all that money I contacted their service and they asked to sell items and keep gems and shards and crystals for deductions and that was never done I contacted and they came up with their excuse that they couldn‚Äôt give me the refund because I used a castle pack which I sold and then got one from another purchase and they said that because I used one it counted as used on their part seriously they just took 49.99 out of my card and made a excuse to keep it."
"5222",692669501,"-1 star simply pay to win -3 stars can no longer connect to the server regardless of WiFi of data  can‚Äôt play if I can‚Äôt connect to the server"
"5223",692669501,"Now I love this game but I have two suggestions to make it better. 1.  I think it would be nice to be able to clear your save and start again but you are able to go back as if you were on a different device. 2. I think it would be awesome if you could trade heroes, gems, coins, honor badges, shards, and more with other people. This would add an extra element to the rest of the game so I and other players could enjoy it even more.  Please implement these ideas into the game in the future.  Thank you, and goodbye."

"5225",693045097,"Can‚Äôt wait to see the sequel from you guys, and also thank you for constantly updating and improving this one."
"5226",693045097,"Imaginative story, I guess, but it‚Äôs too hard to interact with the game. It looks pretty good, but doesn‚Äôt play well. Sometimes I‚Äôve tried things that don‚Äôt work but the game hints indicate that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to do. Challenge is about identifying obscure things like a conveyer belt in a dark room. Gave up. Lots better games, I'm sorry to say."
"5227",693689912,"I am a child using this app.I use this app at school and home for homework.

A suggestion is after you do it you can try to redo it and it could tell you your before and after but IXL  please make this horrible app better. And my mom also agrees but it‚Äôs the only app we can find.if it was 1to5 I can‚Äôt but it‚Äôs a absolute 0  Ps this will probably make your child rage quit"
"5230",694047660,"Simple to use. Caters for everything you'll need to do. Good report templates too. Took a while for me to get the hang of it but after I did, it's been a breeze.   Only shortcoming, if it could be considered that is that there is no Mac version although there is a PC version.  The app has recently moved to a subscription model for synchronization across this devices. Before now, I could synchronize across my devices - iPhone and iPad but since I now had to pay I decided to stick with using it only on my iPhone, which I‚Äôd most likely have around and about me anyways. Yesterday, after updating the app the day before, I recorded my transactions by clicking on the daily reminder that pops up if you haven‚Äôt entered any record that day. Surprise of all surprise, today I open the app to find ALL my records gone - no wallets, no expenses, no income, absolutely nothing! Worse of all, I have no back up of years of records due to their recent subscription model to back up online.  Now, I have to find another budgetting app."
"5231",694047660,"The app is easy to use and very challenging convenient.  Wish there were more options foe expense categories."
"5232",694047660,"I tried a lot of budget and planning apps and thought there was nothing there that had everything i needed.  I had to settle with a couple of apps and was already using it for two months.  But it was really frustrating me and it was not making my budgeting easy. So i looked and found this! It had everything i needed.  The only thing I didnt like was the fact that I didnt know that I had to pay extra for some of the functions I needed.  But they are not expensive, so it was fine for me.  After purchasing the ones i needed, i only spent a little less than five dollars. And i love the app!  It‚Äôs helping me budget, plan, and save money in the end!"

Same with 19 and 20. I wish level 20 looked like level 19 except with a broken roller coaster crumbling apart at the start of the level, why? Because they don‚Äôt look the same.

So basically I spent 2.99 for a weapon that I could only use for one level, and that I‚Äôm being forced to buy more if I want to keep using it, and that just feels like a rip off.

"5280",699687299,"Good value for the price. Got several days worth out of it."
"5281",700227648,"A very good game (even though I‚Äôm terrible at it üòã)  I recently starting playing sunrise mode and it is very nice, but I do have one suggestion. Making the sound you get when crashing something less jarring, it is very intense after the calm music of the game-mode. Changing the death music as well would be nice. Maybe the sound of magi a wind chimes to represent the sparks or something like that for the death sound could be nice, and the post-death music could possibly just be the same soundtrack that plays when you are flying in that world. This would make the experience more calming without the jolt of a crash sound to interrupt the zen."
"5282",700227648,"I just bought it and was disappointed to reveal that it doesn‚Äôt support iPhone X screen. I would give it 5 stars if it was supported."
"5283",700227648,"Please release an update for iPhone X."
"5284",700440156,"I really like this app. The scoring and assessment process is very quick and easy. I really like being able to email the results to myself."
"5285",700440156,"I am so excited to get the full version of this assessment.  Other evaluation tools... (won't mention any names... but you all know what I'm talking about) are over qualifying and do not show the student's progress.  This app will let you adjust norms to fit your populations is very helpful with demonstrating progress. You will be impressed at the ease of administration. And...For the price, you can't beat it."
"5286",700440156,"I am enjoying this app quite a bit. I like the automatic notation of phonological processes, and I love the option of choosing the norms that you want to follow. It has become my preferred articulation assessment tool.  I do have a couple of issues, though.  One, it only sometimes emails the results when I instruct it to do so. Sometimes it emails several days later. The other issue is with the assessment report. I certainly don‚Äôt turn in the report, but I do print it and use it for my records. It is very long with lots of wasted space on the report. Please refer to the report on the Articulation Assessment Toolkit. That report is very well organized and it is much easier to read than the report generated by this app. It looks professional as well, for the folks who may choose to submit it."

"5293",700653178,"But later almost impossible to level up your troops. As the enemy difficulty get higher. The rewards don‚Äôt. My teams level is 16, 17, and 18. A team of all 13s can wipe my team out. You get plenty of money of the levels, but hardly any books to level-up your troops, or stars for weapons. It‚Äôs now just a grind to get the ‚Äúscrap‚Äù rewards to move forwards."
"5294",700653178,"Very amazing and funny Thanks alot I have always search the game like thisüå∫üôè"
"5295",700653178,"I wanted to like this game, I really did. Its fun when you first start but very a quickly you progress to a point where the game gets difficult. I mean after maybe a few hours of playing. This is a pay to win game. You can recruit new troops, but any good ones can't be bought with currency that is more abundant, no they cost 1k+ of the special in game currancy that you need to buy. Oh yeah, you can try to grind and save but did I mention the pay wall you hit after a few hours? Don't waste your time with this. I'm so tired of greedy developers. I understand you have to make a living but this is just terrible."

But when I try to play, the screen is so far titled to one side and it makes it quite impossible to steer. I‚Äôve tried to recalibrate the tilt in the settings but nothing seems to work. Please fix this glitch and the game will be so much better."
"5323",708196645,"I think the bad things about this game is that the controls stink, there is a lot of backtracking, and the game is way to short. Other than that, the bosses, characters, plot lines, and music is amazing! Zelda fans, this is where you should be!"

"5325",708196645,"Game won‚Äôt save, game has numerous glitches that the developers seem to ignore, I‚Äôm currently a legend but stuck on the island of whispers so I started the game from the beginning and just now I started playing and noticed all of my progress and items are gone again!!! Ok for your kids but that‚Äôs about it. Thanks for nothing."
"5326",708379313,"I can‚Äôt make a group permanent, it makes me add the speakers individually each time. And the volume buttons on my phone only control one speaker not the entire group so to adjust volume I have to go into the app and drag the slider. Also the volume buttons on my phone only control one speaker rather than the entire group, forcing me to use the slider volume control in the app itself. Very inconvenient. I would not recommend this, there are better systems available especially for the premium price of Bose."
"5327",708379313,"It would be nice to add a sleep timer."
"5328",708379313,"I have 4 SoundTouch 10's and one SoundTouch 300. I love using this app, but at the same time, I experience some frustrations with it. It really could use some fixes and enhancements:  1. When using SoundTouch to access my Deezer account, and referencing My Library, it does NOT alphabetize the list. I have long lists of Artists and Albums. I have to read through the entire list to find what I am looking for, so it takes a while. That's quite inconvenient. The separate Deezer app does alphabetize these same lists; the SoundTouch app just needs to do that, too. 2. When playing an album with the Deezer service, after a while I can no longer user the left arrow to return to the list of songs on the album. I have to go to the artist's page, then find the album again. 3. When selecting a speaker for SoundTouch to use, I would like the ability to rearrange the order of the speakers (I have 5) so that they would be listed in the app in the order I want. One of my preferences would be to place my primary speaker (SoundTouch 30)  as the first one listed, so it is the first one to appear when I go to the speaker panels.  If I can do it this way, I won't have to swipe through the list to reach my primary speaker every time I'm turning it on for switching music. 4. While swiping through the list of speakers, the app often jumps back to the first speaker in the list, fighting my efforts to choose a speaker other than the first one. 5. When playing on multiple synchronized speakers, and I return to the listing of speakers in the group, sometimes the volume slider for one of the speakers appears in the wrong position. When this happens, the slider is positioned much lower than what is the actual setting. 6. I would like to have more presets. An idea I have for implementing this, using current hardware, is to allow pressing two number keys on the speaker. For example, additional presets could be 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 22, etc. I'm assuming this could be accomplished in the software/firmware. 7. I can't find a way to submit product enhancement suggestions and bug reports to Bose. The mechanism may exist, but I can't find it. The Feedback section was updated with more questions, and the ability to enter text comments. However, the text area allows only a few sentences, then cuts off the rest (I tried to paste in 7 issues and suggestions, with explanations for each one.) Most companies have an email address or web page for this. If I could find a means to do that, I wouldn't be posting these problems and suggestions in the App Store review. 8. While playing music using the Deezer service, I was in the Feedback area in the app, and entering the comments. I had to switch to another app to check my notes. When I returned, the feedback page was gone, and I was left with the Deezer page, but with the top of the page missing: no buttons, and no Deezer name. I had to close and reopen the app to fix it. 9. I would like the option to select the music first and then the speakers second. Currently, if I want to play some music through multiple speakers, I have to first select one speaker, then select the music, then go back to the list of speakers and add the additional speakers to the streaming. Therefore, I would like the option to select the music, then select the speaker or speakers. That would be much more convenient. It would be fine to keep the existing method as an alternative."
"5329",708388097,"I absolutely adore and love this game, however, ever since a most recent update (a couple years ago) I have not seen a single other player on the multiplayer... It really upsets me because I always loved working with completely anonymous people that worked with me and despite so little communication we could know whether someone was agreeing, trying to figure out what you mean, or disagreeing and feeling that their way is better.  The teamwork in this game was amazing, but doing everything alone is not only more difficult, but quite boring... I know it's several years after it stopped working but I really, really hope you guys can update and fix it, please!!"

"5335",709003148,"When I first got this app, the majority of the comics that you could read were free, one would pay to get premium if they wanted to read a week ahead of people who didn‚Äôt.  AND, all of the completed series were FREE!  Since their most recent update (12/1/2018) they have started to charge for reading the previously completed comics.  At this point, since you would have to pay a monthly to re-read comics, you may as well just buy a Japanese comic book that you can write notes (such as translations) INSIDE the comic and it becomes a really fun textbook.  ‰ΩïÊïÖÁÑ°Êñô„Å†„Å£„Åü„Çµ„Éº„Éì„Çπ„ÅÆÁÇ∫„Å´‰ªä„ÅØÈáëÊâï„Çè„Å™„ÅÑ„Å®„ÅÑ„Åë„Å™„ÅÑ„ÅÆÔºüÈ¶¨Èπø„Åò„ÇÉ„Å≠„Äú„ÅÆÔºü  „Åì„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Éó„É™Âç≥Ê∂à„Åó„ÄÇ"

"5375",718043190,"In the latest version of Fantastical 2 for iPhone, Version 2.11 (864), when you tap on an Event, the font size for the Title and the Notes shrinks down to half of the original size. (This problem was not present in any previous versions.) I sure hope this is a bug, because I have to squint now, to read the Title and the Notes. When you edit the Event, the font size jumps back to the normal size again, but I shouldn‚Äôt have to edit each Event, every time I want to read it. Also, when you go to the Fantastical 2 ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù section and select ‚ÄúTips and Tricks,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions,‚Äù the font size for all of that information is even SMALLER that the size I mentioned above. I have been using Fantastical for years. It has been my favorite app. I hope this isn‚Äôt supposed to be a ‚Äúfeature,‚Äù because it ruined the app for me.  I looked in the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù for Fantastical 2, thinking that perhaps there was a new user-selectable setting for the font size, but there was not. I‚Äôm sure that this must be a result of Flexibits adding support for Apple‚Äôs system-wide fonts in iOS, but it has been implemented poorly. I hope someone will fix this issue.

"5390",719401490,"I redownload the game was play through it from the beginning when in battle or when I go to menu I can not see any options. I can not see what I pressing until I click on it and it takes me to items or skills. It‚Äôs annoying when I am in battle and can‚Äôt see what I doing need help. If you can fix this that would be great."

"5392",719829352,"Then please tell me when I register .WHY DO YOU ASK FOR ARE E-MAIL ADDRESS , as u say sigh up or e-mail . But as soon I fill up sigh up and password . You demand a E-mail or no play ball. You sound like google . You say u r safe and private. I don‚Äôt want to give u a e-mail so then you don‚Äôt let me use fire chat . Can you pls answer."

"5394",719829352,"As a Floridian and it being hurricane season (Dorian, Sept 2, 2019) here and the only app I can find that doesn't require data or internet and I can't even register to use the app. It gives me an error as soon as I open the app. Even deleted and downloaded again. Gives me service unavailable (503). Given the unpredictability of hurricanes, it'd be comforting to have an app allowing me to communicate with family and friends should anything happen."
"5395",719972451,"Please add the ability to add favorites, so users can easily find the restaurant they want to order from. It would also be nice to have a feedback option from within the app."

"5399",720068876,"This game is pretty good , also if you google skateboard decks , Santa Cruz decks etc .. screen shot them and put them in the custom photo deck :) you can have any deck"
"5400",720068876,"Illusion labs, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve finished the game and all but you really need to give people a chance to play other maps without buying them. People who have done everything on backyard and don‚Äôt to pay to progress make the game boring and repetitive. Allow people to get a new map once they‚Äôve completed all challenges on the previous map. Thanks bye."
"5401",720656825,"if u have played any of the broken sword games, i think this one was probably the best...... both part 1 and part 2 were great.... would definitely get the next entry in the series... this game is a great value at full price.... it is a fraction of what these games would be on pc or 3ds! great job developers, great story, great artwork..... a cinematic point and click masterpiece!!!"

"5412",721639879,"Just did an update because my son has been playing and there are pop up ads after every crash. If this is 4+ you probably shouldn‚Äôt have dating pop ups.  Ridiculous amounts of pop ups. We‚Äôre probably deleting if it doesn‚Äôt change. It would be 5 star if it wasn‚Äôt for that."
"5413",722217471,"Love this game!"
"5414",722217471,"I played this a couple years ago but deleted it for taking so long to move up the levels. I‚Äôm playing again because a lot of new things are available but it‚Äôs still slow in moving up levels!"
"5415",722217471,"I have played this game for over a year. I was satisfied until recently. My game will not load past 61%. I attempted to troubleshoot myself by reading forums for advice. I decided it was time to ask for support. I emailed and when I finally got a response I was told the error had been fixed and to reinstall. I did as asked. I emailed again to let the company know that didn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs been two days and G5 games has yet to email back. I now haven‚Äôt been able to play for a week. Now even if I do get fixed I will be unable to complete the AirShip quest."

"5422",723795263,"This game used to be great. Now it‚Äôs so buggy. The questions are incomplete and therefore unanswerable. I get error codes constantly. I know I‚Äôm not the first person to raise these issues. What the hell is the hold up on addressing these issues? People have been complaining for weeks and there have been several updates and the issues still exist. For a paid app it isn‚Äôt worth the money or frustration. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the free version either. The ads are more frustrating than the issues I‚Äôve raised and they exist in the ad based app as well. Long time user deleting this app. Bye bye."

Update 9/19/19: latest app update is so bad you would believe it‚Äôs a brand new game created by green amateurs. Ridiculous. I‚Äôve spent tons of time and money in the app I loved it that much. Now questions aren‚Äôt complete, so your answer will be wrong 3 out of 4 times. Questions submitted by followers with the wrong answer are voted in, so there‚Äôs another question you‚Äôll get wrong, if you answer it right. Lastly, you don‚Äôt have a clue who your playing. It may say your playing X and then in your list of games, that player is now J. If you‚Äôve played X in 5 games already it will say neither of you have played before. Do you need more examples?

Lame."
"5444",725222149,"Developers will not update or fix bugs.  The game is riddled with cheaters who have hacked the game.  Cheaters shoot through walls, rocks, hills, and mountains.  Cheaters have unlimited special ammo.  Cheaters have increased their tank speeds so they move like race cars.  Cheaters have altered their internet connection so they lag in the game making it impossible to shoot them.  Don‚Äôt waste your time or money."

"5471",730091131,"This app does exactly what I want it to do. It isn‚Äôt perfect but it‚Äôs very close. It never crashed for me on my iPhone 6 or iPhone X. Exporting the video was never a problem. The editor part can be a little taxing at times, but that‚Äôs ok because I minimal editing here. I just make my green screen scenes here and edit with iMovie. If people have a problem with green fringes, it can help to work on your lighting. Have some side/fill lights on the subject to drown out any green that might be there."
"5472",730091131,"Even with this 2019 update (which is a great improvement) I‚Äôve notice some serious crashing with less than a 100 frames now. Use to get more frames than that before it crashed before; so I have to start a new project (to be safe) after 50+ frames or so. Very annoying for a great product.  PLEASE FIX (w/o erasing everything like that last 3 updates or so)."
"5473",730148796,"Best. App. Ever. Developer responded promptly when we had a few initial set up questions. We set it up effortlessly with both interior and exterior lights and two light strips. Connected a stereo outside on Halloween night. Our house was the scariest in the neighborhood by far! Loved the extra package with additional noises, it was worth the extra $. Thank you for a great app and great communication!"
"5474",730148796,"The audio does not work after the last few updates. I tested on and IPad and I phone X.  Very disappointing as part of the effect is the audio."
"5475",730148796,"This app is rather lame. For starters, i recognize some of these sounds from YouTube, so not all that original. Second, you can‚Äôt make any of these loop indefinitely. I was hoping there was a heart beat mode, and there is, but the color isn‚Äôt just red, it changes with each beat. Who wants that?  In general, these Hue apps fall far short of actually being cool. The light sequences aren‚Äôt all that coordinated and there nothing here you can actually use for anything more than novelty."
"5476",730712409,"I use this mostly taking macro photos of bugs and plants. Close ups of many different items. This is by far the best macro camera in the App Store. IMHO!"
"5477",730712409,"ProCam provides a multitude of options which suit almost every situation. I have tried many iPhone photography apps and Procam is the one which works best for me. Couple that with long-term support and meaningful updates and it‚Äôs a no brainer."
"5478",730712409,"This is bug and I have reported it, this is a paid app and they need to fix it. I will change my rating once the bug has been corrected. Not happy at all!  Side note: it doesn‚Äôt save your shutter speed or ISO settings switching to video mode requires you to reset those two controls."

It‚Äôs so long that she can almost sit on it so I‚Äôve been buying and trying tons of apps to try getting her more comfortable with the idea of a haircut.  I was really excited about this app when I first saw it because my daughter could actually put her own face on there.  I‚Äôm not so happy about it now because the growing serum or whatever it‚Äôs called only lets you get the hair shoulder-length.  Her hair is super long so I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll freak her out seeing herself with such short hair.    Secondly, the styling tools and accessories are all geared towards boys.  There‚Äôs no brush, styling tools, or accessories/extras that are remotely girly.  There‚Äôs only a mustache, fake nose, bow tie, and a blue pin.    The last update was a year ago so clearly this app isn‚Äôt really a priority to the developer anymore.  PLEASE update the app to include girls too!!"

"5489",731041554,"The concept of the game is to basically move your finger around the screen to make the fish swim. It's so simple to use that even the youngest iPad fan will be entertained. The fish explores a variety of fun, colorful scenes. It has saved us from many public outburst from a bored toddler. The only downfall is that the game is very short lived, so for an older child, they'll likely lose interest after 10-15 minutes. Recommend this for ages 1-4."

"5509",735128536,"Love this game. It's one of the few I do not offload. So, the game's very relaxing but requires precision. I couldn't have imagine putting those adjectives in the same sentence prior to playing GoL. It starts out easy but definitely becomes more challenging as one moves through the levels. There are four of five chapters with 25 levels. Even though I wish there were more ""chapters"" (I don't know what to call them), there's a lot to do. I've played through a few times, coming back to it every few months. It is still challenging at the upper levels. My only complaint is the weird Firefly hint deal which is not a component to enjoying the game. Buy it & encourage creativity.  Makers: Hint button. Meh. I used up all of my little bugs in one try because I didn't figure the workings of fast enough. Of course, if this is your intention, cool, I'll just think faster!"
"5510",735128536,"Can‚Äôt believe such an amazing game and the developers forgot about it, 2 years without an update, no new levels, no nothing... this is one of those games I really enjoyed playing, passed it I a couple of hours 2 years ago and I‚Äôm still wanting more from it. You have it guys, please, is it possible to have more levels to play ?"

"5519",735945527,"So I love this game and I loved it for a long time Om Nom is SOOOOO cute and it got even better when I started unlocking things that cost money randomly for free! For example, no ads! For like a month or so I had ZERO ADS! But that all changed when I connected to school WiFi (this iPad is new) and first thing when playing a pop-up appeared. I hoped it was just a glitch that got through but no, it kept on appearing. Then I was hoping that it was just a new ad they added, but then ones I had gotten over a month ago started appearing. I was so angry! My last hope is that it was only on school WiFi but when I got home... AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD! So I am SUPER ANGRY at ZeptoLab UK Limited and if you‚Äôre a developer please respond to this! But overall four stars a pretty good game just drowned by ads. Thank you for reading my super long review and hope you have that super of a day thank you!  Update: It turns out I am realizing what the problem is (probably). I don‚Äôt need your help anymore but will tell you how to remove ads! If this doesn‚Äôt work then I am wrong and I am not 100% sure this will work, but if you go to settings>screen time>content restrictions>web content or something like that>allowed websites only and you go to cut the rope it should work with no ads! Hooray! No more ads! But when surfing the web you will have to turn it off or allow the websites you want to visit. But it will still by a 99% chance work! Have a good day. Edit: Also, you can‚Äôt watch videos with that setting."
"5520",735945527,"The Best."
"5521",736179781,"The messages always show the message of things are quiet. Never showing my messages, other than that it‚Äôs great. Just have to view my messages on the ol Xbone"
"5522",736179781,"Always without a doubt this app is bad. Every time I open it, replaying a clip Grey bar at the top of the screen no scrubbing at all or done to exit. If I press where these things should be it works. Sending messages, sometimes keyboard covers text field as well as messages just don‚Äôt send. After about 3 or 4 try agains it works for some reason. Searching things works similarly, searching a gamertag for example the same gamertag takes a few searches to pop up. I‚Äôve tried deleting and re-downloading multiple times to no avail. At this rate for me the app has more negatives than positive so much so I wrote a review. Simply put it needs way more bug fixes."
"5523",736179781,"Can you please allow me to use the app in both portrait and landscape, it‚Äôs very annoying to have to constantly orient my iPad differently for this specific app."
"5524",736683061,"I‚Äôve come back to this game to play more times than I can count. I‚Äôve never actually finished the game until this day, and I can confidently say that it will always be one of my favorites to play. The story makes you figure itself out with all of its mystery and the emotion involved in such a simply built game is so strong. I love it."
"5525",736683061,"Very unique.  It consumed me completely."
"5526",736683061,"The game is amazing I‚Äôm just making a review in hopes that it will be updated to fit the newer models of iPhone, on the XS the notch blocks location / top of the screen. Should be relatively easy to fix since The Ensign, which is my favorite mobile game, works perfectly fine with a smaller resolution and fits on any device."
"5527",736741821,"I love that I can just start somewhere, anywhere. The first timer is 5 minutes so I pick something small and feel accomplished right away. Then I just keep choosing other small chunks and take the built in break times.  The reason for taking away 1 Star is because an audible feature when the break or work time is up would take it to the next level."
"5528",736741821,"This app is sooo good. Take it from me. If your like me and get really scared to do something that takes awhile, you should download this app, it splits it up from 5 min to another 20 and keeps going and you can chose to take a break. I was cleaning my room for like an hour and I thought it was just like 30 min it‚Äôs amazing. Did I mention that you could pick a reward! Just download this app"
"5529",736741821,"Found it very effective and helpful so far.  Nothing you don‚Äôt need, everything you do... except the ability to set reminders for specific days, not just same time every day. Mainly just need it for weekends.  With this, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars."
"5530",737006024,"I don‚Äôt like this game I mean I do but you should‚Äôve added Thanos to the game and because I don‚Äôt want To collect gold bricks to unlock the next level is because it‚Äôs aggravating and hard so please update this game."

The camera view doesn‚Äôt go that far out either so it‚Äôs hard to tell which way you‚Äôre going unless you look at the map constantly. You also can‚Äôt set way points down unless it‚Äôs part of a mission you‚Äôre following.   Also the planting of the seeds takes forever through the stages. It would be nice if it could be a little faster. Or if not that. Then it would grow while you‚Äôre offline or something. And then when you come back it‚Äôll be ready.

It‚Äôs very easy to use, especially with the barcode scanning feature. There are generally books that I can‚Äôt find, and I wish there was a way to submit those for review and have the reading level get added to them. If they‚Äôre not in the database I can‚Äôt even add them to my library (within the app). It‚Äôs nice that there is a decoder page to match up the various reading level scales, since not all books are rated on all the scales. Overall this app is still very helpful even with the drawbacks listed."

"5564",741293420,"They stopped asking for more money so I moved it up to 3 stars.   I have been using this app for a long time and paid for it in the beginning. Below, you can read my original glowing review.  However, the developers have done virtually nothing since then to improve the app and I have found it to be very unstable, frequently crashing and losing my annotations.  I was happy to see an update pop up for it a few days ago, however instead of improving it this update just makes the app harass me to pay for a subscription to use their new updated version of the app.  This is ridiculous, especially since I already paid for this app!  If you want split screen in a PDF reader, get easy annotate.  For other stuff, go with any app that doesn't crash constantly and doesn't try to get more money from you after you already paid for their product.  If they want to switch to a subscription model, fine, but give a free subscription to the people who bought your app when you were just getting started.  If you won't do that, you have no integrity and deserve to crash and burn!  I have been using the free version of this app which is a reader only for quite a while because it is by far the fastest I have seen.  Meanwhile I have hunted everywhere for split screen PDF apps.  I have side by side which is nice but can't annotate.  I have Easy Annotate which has great potential but which I find slow and temperamental as well as having issues with annotating text in languages that put some characters above and below others.  Recently I learned that this app had added a spit screen view.  I decided to get it and am very impressed.  As a PDF viewer, annotating app, this is the best I have used.  The highlight tool works great in any language I have tried.  Split screen is excellent and easy to use.  File management is functional and easy to navigate.  This is not a media player, browser, Swiss Army knife but it is a great pdf app.  Why only 4 stars then?  There are a few minor things that could be improved.   1. Simplify the highlighter color selection.  I don't need a million color choices.  I do need about 5 good distinct colors that can be easily changed.  The implementation is not terrible, but would be much better if everything but a simple selection of preferred colors was under a secondary menu. 2. Any time you are annotating, the undo, redo buttons should be visible.  Right now, they are often not. 3. The file outline and bookmarks need to be accessible in split screen mode. 4. The underline feature looks excellent, however it is not in the same menu as the highlight option or as easy to use.  It would be really nice if those two options and their color selections were together and if you could underline as easily as you can highlight. Thanks for a great app.  I will be recommending it to many people and will love it even more if you can implement these suggestions."

"5574",743974925,"I purchased PDF Expert: PDF Editor in January, 2018 for $9.99 and have the iTunes purchase receipt.  I used the package occasionally to edit or redact PDFs, and it worked very well.   About a month ago, I opened the package and it wouldn‚Äôt work. When I tried to edit or redact, it offered me a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù teaser leading to a $50/year subscription.   I tried ‚Äúrestore purchases‚Äù which didn‚Äôt work, then contacted Readdle. We‚Äôve been back and forth on this for 3 weeks, but their final message on the topic appears to be ‚ÄúScrew you.‚Äù  It is unimaginable to me that a company would ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù a software package (named PDF EDITOR), removing its core capability, and try to get me to pay an outrageous upcharge to restore the functionality that I ALREADY PAID FOR. This is the most customer-hostile money grab that I‚Äôve seen in a long time. While I really liked the software, I now hate this company, I‚Äôll never buy anything from them again and I‚Äôll do everything I can to discourage anyone else from doing so."

"5576",744189889,"I usually don't write reviews, but this app is absolutely fantastic! So much functionality, a wealth of information and very intuitive to use."
"5577",744189889,"This app is really nicely put together. It is nice looking, has lots of ski resorts in Europe, and has accurate weather predictions. However, in the ""weather"" section, you can only see the weather for Austria. Still, you can see accurate weather predictions of each resort, but for the price, they should fix this. Also, some titles are in German even if you have the app in English."
"5578",744851208,"If you do your research and scour the internet (or the App Store Page) for reviews on this game, you‚Äôll see that most of the reviews label the game as hard. That‚Äôs a complete lie. This game isn‚Äôt hard... it‚Äôs slow.  None of the Kairosoft games are hard. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúlose‚Äù in these games. You just earn far less than you spend in this one. Structures cost upwards of a hundred dollars and you only earn 100 or 200 IF you win a race... and sometimes you won‚Äôt.   The given allowance is spent quickly on new horses and training structures. It‚Äôs not reliable unless you‚Äôre content with saving a lot (of money).  Maintenance costs about 100+ early game and it‚Äôs a constant cycle, so if you don‚Äôt win at least once before the next cycle, you‚Äôll be in the negatives. In addition, items cost upwards of 100 as well. Prices rise the more items you buy.  And of course there‚Äôs the obvious concern: horse lifespans. A horse is done by year four. Their stats decrease so they‚Äôll lose the race ‚Äî and if you don‚Äôt make first place, you get less than $100. Races can‚Äôt be scheduled rapidly either. So you don‚Äôt get paid rapidly ‚Äî only in $100 chunks once per month.  People coming to your ranch spend about $10-20 and only come when you‚Äôve won ‚Äî if you lose your streak, you lose your only source of constant income.  Selling a horse gives you about $1000. But then you spend that $1000 on another horse.  Therefore, in order to progress, you must manage your funds carefully‚Äî meaning months or even years without spending anything on any major progression. The secondary currency, coins, can‚Äôt be spent often since you have to discover an upgrade before buying it.  Races are fun but become mediocre after hours of them. Even when you win. Since horses are temporary and you don‚Äôt unlock breeding until late game, you have to level up your horse faster than the previous one or you‚Äôll just be stuck. You‚Äôll have hit a wall.  The three stars I rate here are basically fueled by my love of horses and the sales price of $0.99, which were barely enough to keep me interested. No wonder the $0.99 sale has stayed past December (winter sales). I was drawn in by that sale. But don‚Äôt be fooled ‚Äî unless you like progressing at a crawl or you love horses enough to be okay with many, many races before you progress."
"5579",744851208,"I love Kairosoft, and have maybe eight of their other games, and this one doesn‚Äôt really even compare to the others it‚Äôs so bad. It‚Äôs extremely simplistic and moves very slowly, after a few hours I‚Äôm ready to give up on it. Seriously it‚Äôs like they gave this project to an intern to manage."

I have had to ask for a bit of help here and there from the developer to input certain things and the return replies were quick and detailed, often with a pic or two.  Quite helpful for me to get back to work.  And this is all before the new expanded version.  Like it wasn‚Äôt magnificent before..."
"5583",744882019,"Ernest you are a saint for making this app. Thx"
"5584",745729888,"I really love this game because it's based on one of my favorite shows and I'm an autistic kid who loves that show because UmiCar is so cute. Unfortunately, that show got cancelled last year in 2015 for unknown reasons, but it was still very popular afterward. If you can get the show to come back with a new fifth season, I will be happy. Plus, I would love it if you make a new iOS game where you actually care for and play with UmiCar. You can ""feed"" him math fuel, caress and tickle him, give him a wash, put him to sleep with a lullaby, and play exciting math minigames with him! Oh, and that's not all; you can even dress him up in cool hats and costumes! Wouldn't that be fun? And one more thing, add coins that help you unlock new toys and costumes for UmiCar. So, what are ya waiting for?! Get to work and do all those things to make me happy!  P.S. Apple has confirmed that iOS 11 will not run 32-bit apps. Because this is a 32-bit app, could you please upgrade it to a 64-bit, adding new cars, decals, and BGM to the game?"

"5593",748048441,"I would‚Äôve considered buying the app for what any other game - either on mobile or on other devices, or even in person - costs.  But I am so turned off by the fact that they want this ASTRONOMICAL amount of money for it.   What the heck is this?!? I‚Äôve never even seen any game, especially a word game, have the audacity to charge that amount.     Give me maybe a $20 App Store gift card along with it & I‚Äôd consider.   Why on earth would someone pay that, rather than to get maybe 5-7 full games or apps for that price!?  I‚Äôve seen it all now."
"5594",748048441,"You can play the first set for free, then have to pay $3 for one level or $32 for all the levels. The game is different and fun for a little while. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth anything beyond the first set though. Bonza is much better and has lots of free levels."
"5595",748048441,"I really liked this game. However, $32 for the rest of the levels, even with the hints and no ads, is ridiculous! I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."
"5596",748057890,"So idk how they make these games so pointless and fun but I have been playing do over 10 years and I‚Äôm still playing them"
"5597",748057890,"This game was not worth 3.99! It only has a few things you can do, it is a repeating process. It‚Äôs come to the point where it‚Äôs boring and I‚Äôve only had it for 24 hours.  I want my money back!!!!!!"

"5606",749078962,"I have paid and tried all of the weather apps and Weather Live is the best of them all. It tops my former favorite NOAA.  Just one thing...we live in Yuma Arizona which gets an average of three inches of rain a year.

"5614",749118884,"Ads? I understand. But now it just freeze at the starting screen with introductions to new features and cannot be closed. I can only tap on ads or paying to fully upgrade it. Come on people, it‚Äôs shameless to launch an app that cannot work and ask for money. Shameless!"
"5615",749118884,"Thank u for telling us all the answer I‚Äôm really good at math now!"
"5616",749118884,"Bought the Pro version where it said no ads, yet here we are"

"5618",749124884,"Constant ads, popups, begging me to upgrade. Not a clock, you‚Äôre downloading a salesman. I deleted it. After I wrote about all the annoying ads and begging me to upgrade, developer wrote that I could avoid the annoying ads by paying to upgrade üòÇ Annoying customers into buying is not a longterm strategy."
"5619",749124884,"The alarms just don‚Äôt go off. Your phone needs to be unlocked! DO NOT USE THIS."
"5620",749125114,"I just made a new alarm and when it goes off the flashlight also flashes. I found no way to turn this off."
"5621",749125114,"Nice looking and feels solid.  But if your routine involves time zone changes, this is NOT for you.  I traveled to NYC for a few days and needed it to wake me up early in the morning to catch a flight. It did. Only an hour after.  Turns out, it didn't pick up time zone change after three days and still thought I was in the time zone before the trip. And there was no indication of its internal clock. When I snoozed it after the alarm went off at 4:15, it said it would sound again in 5 min at 4:20. Yet the phone clock is already 5:15.  That's practically garbage for me. Uninstalled immediately since I don't want to accidentally use it again."
"5622",749125114,"Yesterday installed and this morning woke me up very smoothly !"

"5628",749133301,"I have to admit that I am bit of a weather geek. I used to use WU but I wasn‚Äôt satisfied anymore for several reasons. When a good friend of mine that works for NOAA told me about this app, I went and downloaded it. Then I figured for a few bucks it was worth paying for the extras. I was wrong!  You would think that NOAA would have the latest and greatest technology and the best accuracy. If they do, they sure don‚Äôt put it in this app. I can be watching the storm coming across the Chesapeake Bay and the app shows a 0% chance of rain.   The app is really so bad that I had to add WU back to my phone so I can compare the two . I expect more from this app."
"5629",749133753,"Maybe it‚Äôs me or my laptop but I can‚Äôt stop the never ending ads from popping up on the bottom of my screen. It‚Äôs extremely annoying. I don‚Äôt know why NOAA would allow such a thing."
"5630",749133753,"First time using it and 2 minutes in, a pop up add for Home Advisor takes up the entire screen. Give me a chance to figure out the app before you try to sell me something. Not the greatest design."
"5631",749133753,"I randomly downloaded this one day because I wanted to check how the weather was going to be that day. Know I use it everyday. Especially when I‚Äôm at work. It‚Äôs helps so much because when it starts raining I always check for how long it‚Äôs going to be for and it‚Äôs so accurate. I love it and I recommend it to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have it."
"5632",749969909,"This is crap and is Serato made this app shame on them.  Do not buy it‚Äôs a waste of money no way to play remotely there‚Äôs no start and stop"
"5633",749969909,"The title of the app says""Remote"" so where is the stop/start button?. Holding down that queue button don't do Jack for me.  I'm not trying to mix with this,, just want to start a queued up song away from the rig.  Get on this please."
"5634",749969909,"I spent $4.99 for this?? Smh!! Why is there no play and pause button?? That makes 0 sense.. Also what good is it to be able to go up and down in the crates if you can‚Äôt seen what your doing when your away from the rig.. I really wish I would of seen the comments before I spent the money on it.. I would be a lot happier if it just had them two features over all the effects and loops and all that. All is app needs is the Q points a start and stop/pause button and to see your tracks and crates. But it‚Äôs been over like 3 years so I don‚Äôt see you all doing anything about it.. smh."
"5635",754105884,"Downloaded on iphonex. Does not work at all. Simply gives an era message that it cant access photos. I don't want it to access photos just the camera. Complete waste of money."

"5643",757228497,"It is so fun and easy to do me and my friends love playing it and we love multiplayer!!!"
"5644",757843896,"This is perfect for teaching children cursive. I have my kids use it with the Apple Pencil so the skill will transfer over to real life writing with pen and paper, and it does. The instructions are straightforward and simple enough I didn‚Äôt have to explain to my five-year-old‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt need my help at all. And the animations are dope. They remind me of those bubble things you buy for your desk for people to play with or old Windows screensavers. They are interactive and oddly satisfying."
"5645",757843896,"This app seems to think cursive letters are just print letters with tails. I completely messes up k, b, x and others, which will TOTALLY CONFUSE YOUR CHILD! App should show all the letters so teachers and adults can know what they are getting into. None of the letters with ascenders even have loops for ascenders. This is not simply a matter of ‚Äúmy version of cursive is different than yours.‚Äù This is fundamentally being too lazy to make actual cursive."
"5646",757843896,"This app is very glitchy. It started off okay, and the effects are really nice, but once we got to the letter b it would not allow us to continue tracing the letter. It was like it did not sense the touch halfway through the letter. We tried several other letters and it does the same thing. It is a great concept, if only it would work properly.  We even got the paid version so we‚Äôre out $5 for a non-working app."
"5647",760018895,"Where are directions"
"5648",760018895,"The calculator displays numerous underlines on the calculator keyboard that are incorrect.  The application needs to be updated to be compatible with the current iOS.

"5650",760295036,"Add more weapons"
"5651",760295036,"The app is amazing it is so realistic! I could use more weapons though for the three dollar price it only comes with a few. The creators should be at least dropping a new weapon every month to fuel the fans."
"5652",760295036,"A very good game but like other review‚Äôs say please update or make new games"
"5653",760645916,"i wish i could rate this 5 stars because this game is really fun and really addicting but there‚Äôs a bug. whenever i (and apparently other people, judging by the reviews) play one round, when it usually goes back to the character map, it only shows the characters. it doesn‚Äôt show the option to change characters, collect prizes, or start a new round. i have to completely exit the app and restart it just to play one round. it‚Äôs really annoying and honestly making me want to not play the game."
"5654",760645916,"I give this game a 3 stars.The art style is cool and a nice set of characters.Im giving this app a 3 because there‚Äôs really nothing to do it‚Äôs kinda like subway surfers.üòå"

"5656",761363261,"I am oddly in love with this game. I originally got it because I saw it would work with my Apple Watch. Turns out there are some bugs that prevent it from actually working with the watch, but I love it anyways. Also, please include more game options with the next update, and a way to view the items needed for the mini-quests each pet has with the towns people. Thanks!"

"5669",765224318,"Nice app but won't be supported in IOS 11, don't buy and don't pay for IAP"
"5670",765224318,"Apple says this app will not be supported in the future unless it receives upgrades. To the app sponsors please do so!"

It‚Äôs a shame they never fixed this glaring glitch. But look on the bright side: the pop-up ads still work great!  STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED!   UPDATE 5: It's now September 2016. Yes, the game is still off of my new iPhone 6s Plus. I'm reading more current reviews that have expressed the same frustration I expressed over a year ago with this game. Sad that the developers won't listen to the reviews and make the appropriate improvements to the game. Will check back in another year to see if improvements have been implemented. Out.  UPDATE 4: It's now one year later since my last review, and the game is still deleted off of my iPhone. Looks like more recent reviews are echoing what I stated in my original reviews from a couple years ago. Sad.  UPDATE 3: The game still has glitches where you get hung up on an obstacle and can't get off of it which causes you to lose your life and have to start all over at the beginning. Not sure why the developer will not address this issue. I did see that the developer was pretty quick to install ads and things like that, so I don't know why they won't fix the gameplay bugs. As soon as I finish typing this, I'm deleting the app from my phone. Do not buy and download less you like buggy gameplay that's very frustrating and a lot of ads.   DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED!  UPDATE 2: As others have pointed out, I also have been experiencing bugs in the game where I get hung up on one of the obstacles. When this happens, you cannot move off of the obstacle and you have to wait until the timer runs out and you die. This is very frustrating when you gotten so far in the game and then can't move anymore because you're stuck on an obstacle.  The developer has still not addressed the issue of having to always restart back at the very beginning when you die. This combined with the bugs is making this game very frustrating. I'm on the verge of deleting this game from my iPhone. I'm changing my final analysis to:  NOT RECOMMENDED  UPDATE: This game is still fun to play; however, it is too difficult. I've been playing for the last couple of weeks and still cannot get past the third level. It's very, very frustrating when you die and have to go all way back to the beginning. If this issue is not addressed in an update, I will be deleting this game from my iPhone for good. Not worth the frustration, the aggravation, the waste of time, and the lack of a sense of accomplishment.  This game is very fun to play and very creative. The soundtrack is also enjoyable as are the graphics. I hope the developer continues to develop this game and make it more complex by adding more levels, more obstacles, more power ups, and more overall challenge. Great job so far!  Highly recommended."
"5709",770177884,"Love it! But it hasn't been upd8ed in 2yrs. I had 2 delete it due 2 that annoying pop-up message ""This app/game may slow down your iDevice & may not work in future upd8s."" Hope the developer is not MIA & that said developer will upd8 so it's compatible with iOS11."
"5710",770903376,"Fun game, even when you find yourself getting 100, because you learn about something you don‚Äôt know. I just wish notifications were shown when someone else played and it‚Äôs my turn."
"5711",770903376,"The text is now too small, at least on the iPhone X. Please fix."
"5712",770903376,"We enjoy the game, but I do wish that rounds 1-3 weren't multiple choice. However, it does help the kids with their answers. We did buy the two bonus packs, but for some reason they never worked and had to be refunded. It was disappointing."

"5717",774620933,"Great one"
"5718",774620933,"It looks like this app is no longer being updated which is a huge disappointment. Because after testing many different video subtitle apps, this seems like the best out there. My only critique is subtitles should be added based on the where the movie player indicator is, instead of having to write the in and out points when inserting a subtitle."
"5719",774875399,"This is my favorite board game so I was excited to find out there was an app!! I love playing it but it only gives me single player. The 2 player mode and rank button are not highlighted for me to click on. I‚Äôd love to play others! If I could play someone other than the computer I‚Äôd give it 5 stars"
"5720",774875399,"Perfect blend of luck and strategy in a 2-player game. In fact, it‚Äôs my current favorite real-world board game now when traveling with my wife. This digital version is an exact port of the game, and makes for fun while on the run!"
"5721",774875399,"This is my favorite game right now. Lots of strategy required, some luck involved, really fun to play due to the often highly non-linear progression of play (a single critical move can have a huge impact on the overall balance of power). I wish there were an undo button to fix errant taps, but otherwise this is just like the (super fun) board game, and relatively quick to play."
"5722",775201158,"Why am I being charged for this app ? I haven‚Äôt opened it and it doesn‚Äôt say anything it costs any money for app .  Tried to call the number and just get nobody available . It used a card I longer even have anymore. How does that happen?"
"5723",775201158,"Crashes immediately upon launch"
"5724",775201158,"I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on but every time I open this app, it‚Äôs automatically closes. I‚Äôm up to date on my iPhone and apps. I like the app but what good does it do me if it never stays open?"
"5725",775402833,"Your game is thrash it doesn‚Äôt let you take cards out of deck"

"5727",775402833,"I love wwe my team is RKOmart a lot of my people are lazy sure but it‚Äôs still fun I have 2 cataclysm and 1 summerslam 19 fusion get the game!!!!! Oh and I‚Äôm the owner of the team and my favorite cards are My neon Randy Orton and Summerslam 19 Shelton Benjamin!"
"5728",775737172,"This app needs a Product designer with a focus on Customer Experience.   I have been writing a History book packed  dates and headers. This requires only 3 levels of hierarchy and the appropriate spacing between the headers and between the body to create the right visual relationship so that it‚Äôs scannable.  However there is just one very large distance for the line height,  between all of the headers. There is no way to adjust the gap height, between headers H1, H2, H3 etc... or body.    It‚Äôs always a double return amount of space. I don‚Äôt know what you call it in Markup. But I just want the character size to be different, with a simple return to the next line. I don‚Äôt need a giant double spaced gap between each header.   If I don‚Äôt separate with a double return, then the body gets grouped into the header.  A simple 1 return doesn‚Äôt have any effect. In the editor it looks like it‚Äôs a new line, but I you go to the publish view all the text runs together as if it‚Äôs part of the header. It‚Äôs the Same with all the H‚Äôs. I managed to make it kind of work with H3 and H4. If I could paste their format into H2 and H3, maybe I could get some use from this.  The other problem is return doesn‚Äôt return. It‚Äôs really a pin to go through and add a double space to every line. If I don‚Äôt then it groups all the text into header. The Only way to get the body back down to body size is the space and double return, and then there are all these giant gaps between every date and location. Which is about every 8-20 lines. Probably no big deal for a developer. But for someone whose trying to write content, not code. It‚Äôs a real pain.  The other problem, is the *preview button* keeps going away and there is no way to pull it up except poke around on the top of the screen. So every time I want to check if it‚Äôs formatted correctly I have to tap around to try to find the hidden button. Of coarse then my curser has selected some other line of text and things start popping off, and then the whole page starts scrolling to the top loosing my place.  This really ruins the experience for me, because now, when the button finally appears, I‚Äôm buried somewhere in the middle of 18,000 -30,000 words. Trying to find my way back is a real pain =(. It makes it impossible to concentrate on what I‚Äôm actually trying to do, >write.    The #1 goal I have is to write and markup my sections so the dates and titles are easily scannable. I didn‚Äôt buy the software so I could ‚Äúplay‚Äù with the cool apps features.   I know how difficult it is build an app. But I feel like the Users goals are left out the build process here and instead all the energy went into engineering and implementing  ‚Äúfeatures for developers‚Äù.  I guess it‚Äôs not for long form writers. I don‚Äôt know what I can use to format this project. I feel like email or notes works the best, but they just can‚Äôt handle that much text.  I give 3 stars just because there is so much potential in this app and I really hope they can hire some UX help to figure out what writers want to do (not just devs). And there is a lot of thoughtfulness in it, so I‚Äôm hopeful basic formatting will improve.  But for me it‚Äôs currently not even as useful as the notes app. Which breaks my heart. Because I know how hard it is to build something like this."
"5729",775737172,"Love this app and use it everyday, from publishing to WP to journaling, jotting down random thoughts to compiling lists (I need to stop neglecting Things 3).  One very minor complaint / question about the interface: is it just me or is the cursor not blue as is being advertised in pictures and in writing? Obviously this isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker or anything, but was kinda let down to see it was just the usual, boring grey. Oh well!"
"5730",775737172,"I needed this for my songs"
"5731",775888026,"I love this game - I play it over and over again. I really hope they make more levels."
"5732",775888026,"Watching shapes made from shadows, making tricks with the light is perhaps mankind‚Äôs oldest games. This updates a caveman past time to challenging, creative modern art. Highly addictive, highly recommended."

"5734",776132132,"I don‚Äôt usually do reviews but I‚Äôm highly upset. I lost all my progress due to this new update and now I have to start all the way from ground zero. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the game is great but I really don‚Äôt wanna have to start over plus I actually had purchases that I‚Äôve made and they‚Äôre all gone too.

"5737",776865453,"This game is so much I love how you can do some much to the drivers. I have been play for 2 weeks and I like how the drivers crash. And all of the ways to help your car in the pit stop. Overall it‚Äôs a great game"
"5738",776865453,"Ummm... yes please! And it‚Äôs good to boot? Reminds me of old racing games on PSX where you had to grind your way to the top!"
"5739",776865453,"This game is an excellent Motorsport management game, however I do think it needs the feature to train drivers and upgrade their skills. Maybe 3-4 races and one of their skills will go up 2-3 points."

Out of all the apps in the AppStore I‚Äôve liked this one the best and have learned the fastest and easiest. I like how you can customize it to either pinyin or symbols or both based on your needs. Because this allows me to turn off pinyin unlike other apps it‚Äôs forcing me to actually learn the characters! I also like how there‚Äôs exp and achievements so that it makes it seem like a game"
"5743",777310222,"With this app, the user can download files either from local and cloud based resources and have access to content in most any file format except for proprietary Apple eBooks.  PDF files and Word files load readily without any cumbersome conversions.  The interface is well defined and file management is a breeze.  Annotating texts works intuitively and searching is a snap.  Getting started is quick and easy and once the user becomes familiar with basic functionality, it may be the only reader worth using."

Now I thought maybe because it was the free version, maybe it was time to upgrade it to $3.99 version so I‚Äôve purchased it and tried editing again.   But no, absolutely nothing is working anymore.    I‚Äôm so frustrated, I‚Äôve been trying to contact this developer but there is no option for it.   I want my money back and for it to work again."

We called to ask our tickets be resent, but the representative said they were unable to resend tickets, and we could request a refund instead. So we submitted the refund request and proceeded to purchase a second set of tickets (because we still needed to make the trip). A week later, we receive notice that the company cannot issue a refund because our inbox being full was not their problem. So essentially, they could neither issue a refund nor resend our tickets? What kind of company fails to keep a log of tickets issued? Imagine your airline or train telling you, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt get your tickets? Not our problem! We can‚Äôt resend your tickets OR give you a refund, sorry!‚Äù What a disgrace to customer service.

The second time will be easier because I‚Äôll know the moves, props, get more reps. You need a chair or plyosoft box for step ups & mat for planks & side planks. Try it for a week, you‚Äôll like it.

I‚Äôd like to see some more ifx and some kaoss controls... it‚Äôs 10x better on iOS than switch if you‚Äôre wondering, touch controls make more sense, things flow. Switch feels odd with a controller, and switch has no extra gadgets or ifx at all. Gadget reminds me a lot of FL studio as far as workspace and flow, very easy to copy patterns, move and edit patterns. The built in gadgets could get you through plenty of songs, but some of the purchase gadgets are well worth it and compliment the available gadgets. I‚Äôd highly recommend this, I use it more than Cubasis or GarageBand."

Half the time I have to go back and recheck before finishing my tweet. Tweetbot and Twitterrific have this function all ready build in. If your going to make this client successful I suggest you make sure the client is to pair with your rivals cause alot of users are already a custom to things when have them.

"5853",794960248,"I have replayed it several times because it‚Äôs just beautiful to look at and explore.  All of the little details just make it.  I love the music too, it‚Äôs soothing and fits into each scene, complementing it rather than being a distraction.  This is art in game form.  I do sometimes wish it were a bit longer and that there was a way to explore more freely, but it‚Äôs still a little gem.  Highly recommended, I really hope to see more from this developer someday."

"5869",796959534,"UPDATED UPDATE: This developer proves that his feature-rich approach to inputting text is brilliant. But Nintype still fails to properly interpret many common words. (This technology, pioneered by IBM and eventually migrated to iOS in the long-discontinued Shapewriter, should have been perfected by now!)  UPDATED REVIEW... Very pleased to see this remarkable keyboard finally updated! It now seems more accurate, perhaps even much more accurate! But I must refresh my memory to recall all of its many features! Thanks to the developer for returning to fix his creation. This is one of those apps that you are thrilled to discover, yet are constantly frustrated by it. Every keyboard should have at least a fraction of its clever features. But they don't. Unfortunately, Nintype is unable to fulfill its most basic requirement. After many trials, it seems unable to reliably interpret gesture text-entry, even after giving it time to train itself. A shame!"
"5870",796959534,"Been using this since it first came out. It‚Äôs an off and on off again relationship honestly. Before I stopped using the keyboard because of the constant crashes and memory leaks associated with such an advanced keyboard. But it‚Äôs been well worth it. Texting and even doing essays with this style of keyboard is amazing and satisfying. It‚Äôs realist gratifying once you get the swing of things.   Newest update has made Nintype more stable than ever with almost no crashes ever. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time the keyboard would crash at all.   Now the only complaint and a very minute one at that, is that the little mini game that comes with nintype is almost unplayable. It‚Äôs very glitchy and holding the spacebar to charge the bump to the next word doesn‚Äôt really work correctly anymore.   Ultimately though that‚Äôs really a dumb and minor issue to have, but it‚Äôs a good example of how great this keyboard truly is. If this is the only issue now then it just shows how awesome nintype has become. Texting, and writing notes on your phone especially in landscape mode is a breeze and it‚Äôs amazing truly how fast you can eventually type with this keyboard. Not to mention the haptic feedback and themes you can customize and apply just adds even more content to an already amazing keyboard. Seriously a good job. Can‚Äôt ever go back to a regular touch keyboard again."
"5871",796959534,"Out of all the keyboards that are currently out there, this is by far the best keyboard. It brings something new to the table and requires you to put some effort into learning how to use it, but once you do it‚Äôs a breeze. It looks awesome and actually feels like a smart keyboard. Once you get the hang of it, typing feels effortless and smooth. The biggest problem is after a while the keyboard is constantly restarting, making it unusable. This I believe is more on Apple than the developer because this problem has affected every 3rd party keyboard I have used. It‚Äôs disappointing because I love this keyboard but until Apple fixes its sh*tty platform I won‚Äôt be able to use it consistently. At this rate, I‚Äôm just going to switch to Android given how iOS hasn‚Äôt had a substantial update since Steve passed."

Rest assured it won‚Äôt be for the next however many systems you jump to that have gas planets with no fuel.   This game is not difficult; it‚Äôs punishing. There is no ‚Äúplaying it safe‚Äù or ‚Äúliving to fight another day‚Äù.

"5893",803346990,"This game is terrible. Not worth the money. It was only two dollars but not worth that. The hockey game is a shootout not a game and there is no rhyme or reason where the puck is gonna go. The skating race has a clitch that once the race is over the game doesn‚Äôt realize the race is over and you can‚Äôt move on to the next competition.  The graphics are terrible.

"5903",804379658,"This app hangs-up all the time.  I mean every minute it lags for 10 or 15 seconds.  My impression is The developers are far more concerned about pushing content at me than making the game work."

"5905",804637783,"This is the only iOS app for which I have paid, and I am glad I did. I use it daily, and regularly in about 10 languages. PROS: The translations are so good, and the Copy and Paste function works so well, that recipients in Chat sometimes do not realize I am not a native speaker. The app handles long blocks of text well. CONS: Speech to Text and Speech to Speech do not work reliably; sometimes they do not work at all, while others produce an ‚ÄúInternet connection too slow‚Äù message, even though it runs at over 100 Mbps. Much of the time I get nonsense for dictated speech. WISHLIST: 1. Having several choices for single words would be good, as words can have several senses. However, the app almost always gets it right. 2. A list longer than the 4 previous ‚ÄúRecently Used‚Äù languages would be a timesaver, or the option to select a longer list. (I just suggested this to the developers.)"

"5908",804641004,"This app is not friendly for people who are using the free version. Pop ups after a short while make it unusable. Do not give your money to developers who are in the business of lying."

The only increase in difficulty is that the enemies get slightly more frequent, and you will eventually make a mistake. Probably due to boredom. 3 stars because this game has no flaws (it functions as designed) except that it's more of a demo than a full game."

"5922",805869467,"I love this game!! However only one problem. I wanted to edit the wolf skin and tamed wolf skin. They were both locked. So that basically meant that I had to go on community, find skins, and edit them that way."

"5926",806223188,"Too many of these games have really inadequate instructions. I got really frustrated and had to google some of them.

My scores go up and down."
"5927",806223188,"There was a recent upgrade and now right after I play a game I don‚Äôt get the screen which lets you see your progress in meeting goals.

"5931",807411101,"This is worse then other games."
"5932",808108897,"I love this game but it needs work. It would be much funner if you could pick the injuries for the pets, it would also be funner if you had to find out the injury with vet tools. And it needs more animals, it gets boring doing the same animals over and over again. But overall this game is pretty fun."
"5933",808108897,"My very young niece purchased this game by accident and I would like to get my money back. I‚Äôve been looking for a way to cancel the purchase or at the very least communicate with someone about this but can‚Äôt seem to find the report a problem button. Please help."
"5934",808108897,"I love this game. It was very fun"
"5935",808296431,"I Like it allot there‚Äôs so much to do in story mode. But the thing with creative mode is there should be bosses ,creative mode trinkets and npc‚Äôs"
"5936",808296431,"I played Crashlands and enjoyed it a lot until this morning when playing the tundra level and warped back to savannah to find that all of my buildings and pets are completely gone and the map reset and all of my exploring is gone.  I registered and have been saving my game often, to no avail apparently.  So, I recommend the game if you want to play and suddenly have all of your progress disappear about 75% of the way through the game, but otherwise could not due to the disappointment."
"5937",808296431,"I am currently on my third play through of the game and I love it so much! The jokes never get old I always find something new on every play through even though I‚Äôve had this game since launch and it keeps getting better but just please don‚Äôt abandon the game. It has such potential but know that I‚Äôm done ranting I‚Äôll actually give suggestions. Make it so that creatures can attack through walls even though it‚Äôs fun it‚Äôs to easy to whack things like glidopods through walls. Add a local multiplayer function and please not like the couch Co op sure it‚Äôs fun to play as juice box but it‚Äôs much more fun to play as flux and have the ability to be constantly getting stronger also add a utility slot so that you can put something like a harvest bomb in there and don‚Äôt have to switch it to a normal slot. Also please expand on pets in stead of just growing or evolving them make it so that you can make them gear. And that‚Äôs it thanks for making such amazing games and I hope that if you read this wich you probably didn‚Äôt you take some off the suggestions anyway that‚Äôs it."
"5938",808794344,"Don‚Äôt bother."
"5939",808794344,"Have been loving the Olympics, though watching in Hawaii, everything is over by the time we get it. I end up watching a lot of double coverage, it‚Äôs in reruns when we get it. Love the curling and biathlon , speed skating, short track , well everything, have loved seeing the respect between participants, it‚Äôs heartwarming. Real sportsmanship!"
"5940",808794344,"Half the time the content won‚Äôt load. The schedule is laughable. In this age of technology, it‚Äôs pretty sad that this app is such a major fail."
"5941",810405576,"I love this game!  I have all my students buy it to help with their note reading.  I especially love that tenor clef was recently added.  The only thing it‚Äôs missing now is a setting to combine some or all of the clefs in one game to practice switching between them in real time (like for advanced cellists who have to read bass, tenor and treble clef fluidly; or violists who frequently switch between alto and treble clef).  Maybe make this upgrade at some point in the future?  I would even pay a higher price for a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù version that has this feature.  In any case, thanks to the developers for the awesome app!"
"5942",810405576,"This is amazing. Any bad reviews don‚Äôt make sense. This game is great. My piano teacher recommends this and it‚Äôs fun. No ads all education for the piano. This is ligit."
"5943",810405576,"Fun and helpful for a violinist who dabbles with occasional viola parts. I wish notes on ledger lines came while it is still slow so I could get used to what they look like."
"5944",811397653,"Simple fun. The music in this game is awesome. The song that plays during the actual dungeon run, should it ever be played by a real heavy metal band, it would be an anthem.  I have opened this game just to listen to that song before. :-)"
"5945",811397653,"Shouldn‚Äôt even come up in a ‚Äúmatch 3‚Äù search. The difficult mental shift to these...alternative...marching mechanics makes the game unfun."
"5946",811397653,"This game has been a bigger headache than any other match 3 game I‚Äôve ever played. Some would say that‚Äôs good, and I definitely think that has its place, but I think this game would really benefit from an easy mode. Some people like perpetual ramping-up difficulty, but every now and again I just want to have some mindless fun and wreck shop in a dungeon. A zen mode unlocked after the main campaign could be an alternative. At this rate, I feel like I‚Äôm going to reach a point where this game becomes too frustrating to be fun to play."
"5947",813330182,"While there is a certain playstyle the game loves, it still gives you an huge array of ways to play your way. There are different ways to interact with most everything, and you can't become dependent on one factor alone to win, unless you're willing to accept a near endless chaotic campaign. Deep, fun, kind feeling as you interact with various organizations, endless character and the best art style and strategy, this game is the best on the App Store.  Still, its long and not worth a buy if you plan to update, definitely amazing. As close to beyond perfect as any GS on here."
"5948",813330182,"Love this game! Perfect strategy game for iOS. Also fun with the real time battle stuff. If you like Civs on computer, this is a perfect, mobile, dumbed-down version. Can we get it updated tho??? I can‚Äôt play and I‚Äôm sad."
"5949",813330182,"Probably the best strategy game I've played on the phone. Reminiscent of the total war games for PC but with its differences. Game hasn't crashed and I haven't run into any bugs. Super fun and I definitely recommend.  Will raise back to 5 stars when it is updated for new iOS"
"5950",814323051,"Like that it‚Äôs challenging, but would have liked a tutorial on some sort of basics of bridge structure having no experience with any sort of physics, kinda a dummy üòÖüòÖüòÖ. Otherwise, good challenging game."
"5951",814323051,"This so far is the least fun out of an otherwise enjoyable series. The limits on materials take away from the creativity of the other games and the addition of in-app purchases is a disappointment. Gameplay is also less enjoyable. The units crossing the bridge move incredibly slow making the design/testing process too cumbersome."
"5952",814323051,"I don‚Äôt know about other people it‚Äôs just the screaming when the bridge brakes into two or just collapses when they die they scream and I find it very annoying so ether get rid of it or try to make it less annoying but I‚Äôll still play it"

"5958",814656403,"App can be fun and addictive but there have been too many times when I have cooked food for hours only for it not to show up on my counter. Storm8, 2 six hour recipes for French dip sandwiches should equal 900 sandwiches, not 200. Done."
"5959",814977594,"I bought this game thinking it was going to be fun. Turns out this game isn‚Äôt fun and is a waste of your money I don‚Äôt recommend buying this game. I would like my money back if there is someone to talk to about this that would be awesome thanks."

"5965",815218412,"I can‚Äôt help but notice that this apps program does not encompass my iPhones full screen, it does not fill the whole screen and leaves a half inch of blackness on bottom and top. I assume this is because this is an older app and you haven‚Äôt made any updates for the newer phones. If you‚Äôd be so kind I‚Äôd like to see an update but other than that it‚Äôs a fantastic app to use for vocabulary. This app does a great job at explaining what something means and it makes it fun."

"5970",816202468,"Best game in the world"
"5971",816283225,"I got this game a few weeks ago but it is AMAZING. I have so much fun in not so fun situations. But there was a graphic glitch where the second skin of barnarnas hand is a placeholder instead of the chicken leg this is really annoying me so if you can fix it that would be GREAT thanks!!"
"5972",816283225,"It‚Äôs seriously out of control. When starting out, you‚Äôll be lucky to play for 15 seconds between 30 second ad breaks. As the title says, I had 6 30-second ad breaks in the 5 minutes I had the app open. Could be decent to play on the train, but I doubt I‚Äôll ever open the app again. It‚Äôs absolutely shameful that this was an ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Choice"" app."
"5973",816283225,"So the games fun, so fun that I decided that I wanted to support the game by buying the pro tour thing it was 99cents, it came with 1k gold 100 free gold claw things, not sure what that is, a character, unlimited access to the pro tour game mode, and it would remove ads. I bought it got the character, 1k gold, and unlimited access to the pro tour mode. I still get ads and I have no clue what the 100 gold claw things were, tbh I don‚Äôt really care about the gold claw thing, but I hate that it didn‚Äôt remove ads it‚Äôs stupid I paid the 99 cents so the ads should be removed, that‚Äôs the only issue I have. Games fun, besides getting scammed, it‚Äôs only 99 cents so I don‚Äôt really care but it‚Äôs scummy nonetheless. 3/5"
"5974",816821851,"I had several apps that was able to remove.  Ytools has a superior look and feel"
"5975",816821851,"I have several measurement apps on my phone, but I've gone through a couple dozen to find the best for particular purposes.  This one is the best in its class by far and worth paying for.   I work with a lot of small items and I'm bad at judging their size by sight or knowing how big something is by its description, this solves those issues quickly.  I especially love that I can quickly toggle between metric and imperial measurements.  I've made use of some of its other features too, but the measurement tool is fantastic on its own.  I also appreciate the not white background."
"5976",816821851,"So many other apps have the same tools but this one has some very useful apps all I'm one place, easy to access, easy to use."

"5984",819627009,"I‚Äôm a pharmacist who used to use this app as an alternative to more expensive drug information databases. It was helpful for when I‚Äôm away from my computer and with patients or when people asked me questions when I‚Äôm not at work.  A recent bug that other users have mentioned has rendered the app useless. It works fine when you download it at first. When the app updates once, it gets stuck on the last drug that was searched. The only way to look up a new drug is to delete the app and re-download. There‚Äôs also a bug where all headings within the drug‚Äôs page pull up the same information. Currently, information for the ‚Äúdosing and indications‚Äù tab pulls up when you open all other tabs. The interactions database appears to work fine.  IBM needs to fix this before they lose all their users. I‚Äôm upgrading to a better database."
"5985",819627009,"This app is stuck on one medication. No matter which drug I click on, the same medication comes up each time. This makes the app a useless was of time and money. Please fix this!"

"5998",822701037,"The game has a nice concept, was challenging enough at times, but short-lived and super frustrating at the end. The entire game was kinda easy, but then at the orange level everything was super difficult and near impossible to finish. I‚Äôm not even sure some of the levels there were actually possible to finish. So I gave up after 100+ tries and looked up a walkthrough to see what would happen at the end. Guess what? It‚Äôs an empty orange room with absolutely nothing in sight. So don‚Äôt waste your time trying to beat the orange level, you‚Äôll hardly be rewarded. The insane difficulty on the last level just seemed to be an excuse to lengthen the already super short game."
"5999",822701037,"Man, this game is just amazing. The combination of frustrating and fun is amazing. And I especially love the ‚ÄúOrange Levels‚Äù. I can say that I have beaten the orange levels, and the ending is a bit anti-climatic. Either way, I love the game."
"6000",822701037,"Amazing game like I‚Äôve never written one of thes before but I loved the game sm that I took time outta my day to write one... one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played if not the best... would recommend playing with headphones tho"
"6001",822797943,"I think it is a great way to write."
"6002",822797943,"I can‚Äôt even type a sentence without losing my train of thought with the auto insert. I would like to use this app again. I‚Äôm not sure what the latest update has done but I would like it to go back to the previous version. :("

"6011",823518885,"I could not move or mine anything! And there are no other players, I hate this!!!"
"6012",823518885,"Bruh when I first got dis game I thought it would be soooo much fun but the truth is this is worse than any other app I‚Äôve ever seen. I rather spend 7 dollars on Minecraft than play this garbage do not download plz if u waste ur time downloading this garbage than ur weird."
"6013",823804745,"this app is overall good but it is filled to the brim with players who beg for endgame items when they should get them their self and the people who drop items for them and defend them are as bad if not worse some of the beggars are really rude and swear at people who kill them for begging i used wired explosives to kill a beggar and he got mad and swore at me i joined an all items map and killed the owner with explosives for trying to attract beggars he left so i got disconnected then he swore at me in this apps chat that is why i remove 2 stars"
"6014",823804745,"This app is awesome whoever made this app needs to be promoted to anything I got cool stuff I was a newborns annoying and cool stuff from anywhere"
"6015",823804745,"It is an amazing app for Terraria and it worked fine but until the new 1.3 update for Terraria mobile it doesn't work anymore. I also can't use the Terraria multiplayer section because I can only use local but not online. If you are able to, make an updated version for 1.3 edition on mobile. Would appreciate it!!!"
"6016",823869162,"Okay I love this game I built so many airplanes like b-17, b-24, b-26, MD-11,Boeing 737, and Dc-3. I built WW2 ships and bombers like  T2 tanker, USS Iowa, A-26, A6m Zero, he-111, USS   Montana, and BF-109. Great game."
"6017",823869162,"In a plane building app, I suppose there‚Äôs always more you can add, really though, the only changes I‚Äôd like would be: 1-More Weapons 2-Website in-app  It‚Äôs not too difficult to just use the website, it would just be nice if it had its own app or part in the app. A lot of the accessibility is on the PC but there should at least be an account manager in-app."
"6018",823869162,"I used to have this game on my little kindle fire as a kid and it was great but now I got on and then got a text so I texted back and when I got back on it crashed, so I loaded the game again and it was just the grey loading screen and it wouldn‚Äôt change. Anyone know how to fix that?"
"6019",824281761,"When is sago mini big city gonna come out as standalone? You should also update the app. It‚Äôs June and it‚Äôs not Halloween anymore. Halloween is in 4 months."
"6020",824281761,"My two year old loves this game, I just wish it didn‚Äôt have holiday themes. We don‚Äôt celebrate and since it‚Äôs December now I would expect the Halloween theme to be gone, but I guess not. ü§î"

"6022",824305459,"Games is fun! I used to play on Computer! Nothing to but in the store nothing to do other than serve 6 people a day. Sad thing is the developers of this game have no regard to all the other complaints left years ago! I‚Äôm upset because I expected more...... not about the $.99!"
"6023",824305459,"I played this in Coolmath often in school before the website got blocked by my district. This game is unique. I can‚Äôt find other games like this, but if there are games like this then I know they will never have the same style and look as these games. Papa‚Äôs Freezeria was definitely the first Papa game I ever played. Downloading and playing this brought back a feeling of nostalgia and I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôll keep playing for a long time. Nothing beats the first Papa game you play."

"6025",824421012,"This is beyond any other ‚Äúart filter‚Äù app out there! The filters are subtle and keep the integrity of any photo. Totally worth the money!"
"6026",824421012,"Loved this app but was not opening on my iPhone X. The develop a team reached out to me and suggested deleting the app and re-downloading it. I did that and all is good  A few months later I am trying the same remedy as the app no longer opens."
"6027",824421012,"You have to try it and keep it!"
"6028",825089659,"I love to play FoE and figured this app would run better that the free version of regular Photon.......Nope I was wrong! Would love to get my money back but of course that's a waste of breath! I give it no rating because it didn't work at all for what I wanted it for. Oh that's right I have to give it a star just to send this review...SMH!"

"6030",825089659,"The screen freezes whenever the device is rotated while in flash mode."

"6032",826523703,"Too many ads"
"6033",826523703,"Let me start with love and say I‚Äôm addicted to this game....BUT, and this is a big BUT, the connection issues and how you get screwed out of coins(and messes up your win record)when you re-connect is a big disappointment, and it happens at the worst of times it seems. You could take a shot with plenty of time left, make the shot, then there‚Äôs a connection issue, then you get reconnected, and it‚Äôs like your shot never happened and you‚Äôre opponent is shooting now. Come on guys, this has gone on for TOO long! For that you‚Äôre getting a 2 stars review ;("

"6036",826921329,"The features are nice and easy,I would recommend possibly more shading options. App is good fun"
"6037",828005193,"I used to love this game but like other apps, with time it‚Äôs become more about getting players‚Äô money. I‚Äôm pretty sure the level 2 items are much more expensive than they were before. I had to start over bc I‚Äôm on a whole new account so I was able to see some differences. The customers lose their patience much faster and everything takes longer to make food which obviously makes it hard to serve customers with 5 hearts. By the time I even get the food item to an appliance to start making it, the customer is down a heart. It definitely wasn‚Äôt like this before because I would not have played it so much, nor would I have bothered to re-downloaded it. There also weren‚Äôt any ads before but I guess I understand those. However, if I‚Äôm gonna be forced to sit through a video, it seems like I could at least get some kind of in-game currency. I wish this game would go back to normal but I also wish they would give more supplies or just kinda do away with that limitation."
"6038",828005193,"I‚Äôve played this game since 2016 and with all the changes it is so different me and my sister used to love bragging to each other about levels now it so different üòê"

"6040",828392046,"My daughter loves this.  Its incredible how well this teaches phonetic (and sight) reading.  It definitely requires parental guidance though; do not send kids off to play this by themselves.  This program builds up new skills and sight words FAST, often using sight words that the student hasn‚Äôt seen as the answer (it‚Äôs a good thing; students figure them out by process of elimination and are never shown two new words at once and are required to recall or sound out multiple previously seen words ).  By comparison, ABCmouse seems galacially paced.  Most kids will do better if an adult is there to help them walk through the words when they forget a skill or get confused."
"6041",828392046,"I recently purchased and wouldn‚Äôt allow me to download, what a let down."
"6042",828392046,"My son was in Pre-K and we wanted a fun app that would get him ready for school. Tried a bunch of the others including ABC Mouse and he gave up on them easily. He loved this one. Both him and his brother challenged each other to get stars and build the spaceships. After one year he is reading ‚ÄúLevel 2‚Äù books on his own as he heads into Kindergarten and a huge part of that is due to this app."
"6043",828578246,"The latest update has unfortunately  undone much of my progress. Developers have ignored my requests for help."
"6044",828578246,"Did the update. Went to answer a call game resets faster now.  Lost current play.  Don‚Äôt use coins in game play unless you going to play continually.  Game will reset."
"6045",828578246,"Since the last update, I find gummy really not as much fun.  Seems if you spend some money to buy coins or rewards they are make the game easier.  If you don‚Äôt spend money, they won‚Äôt let you win at all.  It was my favorite game till this last update üò¢"

"6051",829587759,"Enjoying it so far. I need to become comfortable with Spanish. Not bilingual but able to at least take a stab at casual conversation. The app is easy and kind of fun."
"6052",829739720,"I have in app ratings turned off but it asked anyway. This rating is based upon the blatant disrespect for my wishes."
"6053",829739720,"Not optimized for iPhone X and probably some other iPhones as well, missing features and poor maintenance from the developer."

"6063",830544402,"So much fun. Intense moments. Worth every penny."
"6064",830708155,"Unfortunately this app does not contain the tools that I needed, and so I deleted it and replaced it with another app.  It is not a bad app - it just doesn‚Äôt have the abilities I want in a calendar."
"6065",830708155,"I make a change in my google calendar and it can take hours for it to reflect in Fantastical. This never used to happen."
"6066",830708155,"This app needs a total reworking towards an intuitive UE: There is no monthly calendar as such, which means you can't see groups or patterns of exact entries ‚Äî the native iPad monthly calendar is near perfect; the Fantastical bars on the weekly view are laughable ‚Äî who knows what they communicate; and, empty days don't show in the laborious dot/agenda list, adding to the confusion. (Outlook has this just right.) It's an app that fails at being quick and intuitive. Use the iPad calendar and use Reminders, and you will have a better calendar experience and save your money. (But, Fantastical does have a terrific widget!)"

"6070",833756002,"This game goes Stu"
"6071",833756002,"If you have angry issues and you like to get all of the golden stars then I don‚Äôt suggest you playing this game, trust me after beating five stages my iPad had two cracks in it. Again DON‚ÄôT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE ANGRY ISSUES but if you have a lot of patience then go ahead!"
"6072",833756002,"The game is really entertaining and it‚Äôs just challenging enough! My little cousins love it and my grandma loves it!"
"6073",833951143,"Eg. I took the Zoltan ship which has a special shield that stops teleportation. 3 times in a row I was destroyed in the second sector by boarding parties that just ignore the shield and stomp my wimpy crew. No strategy or skill could prevent the wipe out.  It‚Äôs not a bad game if RNG is your thing.  I just do not equate a game overwhelmingly dependent on RNG luck to a good strategic challenge, however. The interface is well designed and easy to interact with & use.  Good graphics.  Reply ability with different ships is dependent on unlocks which are heavily dependent on RNG.   Do you feel lucky punk? Do you?  If you‚Äôre looking to save money flip a coin.  Get heads 5 times in a row you WIN! Otherwise you loose.  Thats FTL in a nutshell."
"6074",833951143,"For the most part the only reason people are bashing this game is because it‚Äôs too hard. The reason of the game is to play through many times, develop a strategy, form a plan to finally beat the game. When you do beat the game after losing 40 times it‚Äôs amazing and worth while. If you could save the game and continue it would get old way to fast and your actions would not have consequences. Yes it‚Äôs hard, but totally worth it."
"6075",833951143,"Great game but no updates for 2+ years. That means it doesn‚Äôt fit the screen sizes of a lot of modern devices like the iPad Pro 11‚Äù."
"6076",833958016,"It says the game is free but after the first chapter you have to pay for the rest. Don‚Äôt lead us on then hit us with money, just make the game a paid game!"
"6077",833958016,"I love this game but I‚Äôm 13 and I got no money so I can‚Äôt play anymore than the first episode."
"6078",833958016,"This is one of the few games that I couldn‚Äôt wait to finish it. The only issue I have was that I need to have a chapter 10.Maybe they stop at 9 because that‚Äôs how they want us to remember. To remember that our love story truly never finishes and it‚Äôs up to us to continue it."
"6079",834246564,"The reason why it‚Äôs boring is because most of the stuff is ‚ÄúIn App Purchase‚Äù so basically we can‚Äôt finish up our ‚Äúclients‚Äù. It‚Äôs not fair because my cousin has this game and she has LG. I have an iPhone but her games and tools are unlocked! I don‚Äôt know why apps make specific things for specific devices. It‚Äôs sad, there is too much ads and pop ups. This game sometimes freezes and glitches. It was fun at first until I saw that all the most needed items were locked. If I was TabTale I would make less ads and no items locked. TabTale, if you are reading this your games are interesting but needs a little fixing...ALOT!üôÑ"

"6089",834715612,"I have beaten the game today ,I am not the touch the screen type of games gal yet I have immensely enjoyed this one . Upon my previous PlayStation games experience especially silent hill this game was amazing ,nice graphics and story line ,morbid creepy themes . One last say to the game developers .i wouldn‚Äôt say it is a silent hill rip off yet I would say it‚Äôs a spitting image of it . Even the way the avatar moves .,melee weapons ,the mannequins. Good job looking forward to meet the developers on the PlayStation games market soon"
"6090",834715612,"This game is not jump scares, but it has a great setting, music, voice acting and cut scenes. It was done incredibly well despite not the most user friendly game controls. It has manual saves, so it feels like a bit of a throwback and it really did create a sense of fear that many movies and games haven't done since some of the classics. It's done phenomenally well and a no brainer if you want a legitimate horror video game experience, imho."
"6091",834854351,"The free Scanbot is good but not necessarily better than other free scanners. In fact, there are other free scanners that can do more than Scanbot. All the locked features are available on Scanbot Pro for $70. However, even those premium features are free in other free scanners, so whenever there is a limitation in one scanner, I simply move to the next scanner that does offer that feature for free.   Most free scanners have limitations, but, as long as I move from one free scanner to the next, I basically get to use the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù features.  I hope Scanbot Pro can reasonably reduce the price in half, because with the availability of free apps and in-app purchases, few people would pay monthly for a scanner."
"6092",834854351,"Fantastic App, super easy to use, very common sense navigation and no convoluted processes. I‚Äôve tried many different scanning apps to gather my information and eliminate paperwork but none are like this one.  I can‚Äôt recommend abetter app out there and would encourage anyone to grab this one!"
"6093",834854351,"The scan quality of music with my iPad Pro is terrible. When i take a photo of music it is just fine."
"6094",834993441,"At first I loved this game, but as I have progressed it has nothing to offer. I have amassed and spent over 50,000,000 gold and it‚Äôs pointless. I have all of the wands and all of the hats and armors. I am at level 111 in the endless dungeons and nothing changes. No matter how much attack power I add, the tougher enemies still take just as long to defeat, regardless of the wand I‚Äôm using and the weaker ones blow over like dust bunnies.   Like I said, it started out great, but it could offer more."
"6095",834993441,"This game should be a üò± because it is the best game ever it has scary monsters like this emoji üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èthis game is educational and it is super addictive if you don‚Äôt like the game I will ü§¨üëøüë∫on you so yeah it is the best"
"6096",834993441,"I enjoy the game, but it is quite difficult for the kids I work with. They are dyslexic and have a hard time finding words so quickly without dying right away. The kids love killing the monsters!  I would love to see an option where you can either have no timer or that the timer can be  set to be slowed down. MG"

"6103",835731296,"This app is now the best ever, I love it! I had to wait for awhile for this to happen, but now everything‚Äôs perfect!  And they have a new feature where the music scrolls for you at your own pace, I strongly recommend this app!"

"6112",836464625,"THANK YOU to the creators for making this app! Just WOW! Anatomy and foreshortening are two of the hardest subjects to master, and this app addresses both masterfully! Being able to pose however you want and add realistic lighting makes drawing accurately sooo much easier. Looove it so much, bought the bundle. It's a must for visual artists! Thank you!üôèüèΩ"
"6113",836464625,"Update: man thanks so much for removing the background for the models, this really helps out so much!!  Such an awesome app in both versions. I use this a lot and would like to see other things added like the ability to have the option to bring in another pose model or two so you can have a duo set atleast like for posing a fight scene ect. And perhaps even props/accessories  to use like sword, pistol, chair, stump ect. and a creature model version of this would be awesome as well. Hope to see much more!!"
"6114",836464625,"I love this app a lot can‚Äôt ask for much more.  You get everything you need to create awesome poses in which you can screen shot and use for references while drawing rather digitally or non-digitally.  The only thing I would be awesome for this app is to adjust body weight not just by muscle mass, but also by body fat.  One other thing would be to add in some props like:  weapons, furniture, cell phones, computers, and drinking mugs. However the app is fine without these but the other pose apps are pushing these extra options."

I never experienced any issues with shipping, ordering, or customer service. I definitely recommend this company for everything in your home."

"6121",838455884,"I really do but I wish you don‚Äôt fall when you walk or turn and I want these characters to have Faces so please update those 2 things I said please please update please please"
"6122",838455884,"It‚Äôs so bad. Waste of money. Every time you move an inch you fall over. You can‚Äôt do anything you just sit there and wait to fall"
"6123",838455884,"Pls update the game again"
"6124",838500730,"I‚Äôve always loved the show!!!....and I really love this game...it‚Äôs rightfully addicting and it‚Äôs honestly very fun..."
"6125",838500730,"downloaded this game yesterday. i played for an hour and this game crashed every five minutes on the dot. it wouldn‚Äôt save much of my progress before crashing so i always had to start over.  besides the crashing, this game is insane. to complete a quest i have to wait 4 to 8 hours. keep in mind, i‚Äôve only been playing for an hour. shouldn‚Äôt i still be doing 10 - 30 minute quest?  the thing that really made me decide to uninstall was the fact that the developers don‚Äôt care about the quality of the game anymore. the last time i saw them reply to one of these comments was a year ago. if they don‚Äôt care about their game then why should i?  i recommend downloading the ‚ÄòSimpsons tapped out‚Äô game instead. unlike family guy, the Simpsons developers still care about the quality of their game."
"6126",838500730,"Who actually plays this anymore? People who probably can afford to spend $50. an event. So now you have a quick event(5th anniversary-part 5). What that means is to spend money quickly, because it‚Äôs impossible to get both characters without doing so. And even so, you would have to spend clams to speed it up, because they only give you a few chances to watch ad‚Äôs before it stops letting you. The underwear rack for 199 clams is a ripoff, it only gives you 2-4 underwear‚Äôs every 12 hours! You need 40 for one item, and 60 for another. That basically saying, they only allows you to get one at a time, that would take more than the 5-6 days of the quick event to complete it."

"6132",839210443,"I love the game! It is very fun entertaining and you look forward to finish everything! The only problem I have is most of the time when I get off the game it won‚Äôt save my progress üò≠... other than that I am very happy and satisfied with the work put into the game."
"6133",839301889,"Jupiter Jump is a masterpiece of modern entertainment. I have sunk hours and hours into jumping through these green gates, and I don‚Äôt regret a second of it.

"6134",839301889,"This is an amazing app! I look forward to possible new updates. (No, people, the fact that it is obviously not jupiter DOES NOT BOTHER ME. I don‚Äôt know why it bothers you!)"

"6138",839599050,"i was at 200k per swipe with everything bet high at price and the game literally reset!! it put me back at $1. Is this apart of the game or something?! It took so long for me to get there!!!!!"
"6139",839897809,"Honestly way better than most high school teachers. They know what they‚Äôre doing. This app has helped me in math so much"
"6140",839897809,"This app really has helped me with my struggle! I‚Äôm no math whizz and probably might not be for the next couple years, but I‚Äôll be able to understand certain things since the tutors are kind, supportive, and positive throughout!"
"6141",839897809,"I am a student and tutor myself. I have struggled with the current math I am in and catching up to my class. So when my dad found this app I was relieved. The tutors give me the confidence to attempt work on the classroom. I am very pleased with my experiences so far! Definitely would recommend!"

"6148",840811083,"This games seems interesting, and it is, for five minutes, after which it gets very boring. This is certainly not worth three dollars, I would criticize its lack of content if it was free."
"6149",840811083,"This game is a must buy. I wonder if they would make a second game soon it's that good."
"6150",840811083,"Got bored in about 10 minutes. I enjoy the concept and I think the app was made well but I don't think it's worth $2.99 when there really isn't room for further content.   I also hate the timed feature. It makes it less a puzzle and more of a speed test. You're not really thinking about it as much as having quick reflexes and hope for the best.  If it was not timed or offered a timeless feature I'd enjoy it more, but still doubt that I'd play it more than an hour or 2.   In its defense I was hoping it'd be a bit more closer to Einstein's 5 houses riddle so maybe I just disappointed myself when it wasn't along those lines as much as I'd hoped."
"6151",840919914,"I hate it I won‚Äôt even let me play, if I could give it zero stars I def would!"
"6152",840919914,"It keeps on crashing"
"6153",840919914,"Great game. Should be 5 stars. But the ads are so unfairly invasive. The game will start and mid-swipe an ad pops up and tricks your thumb into clicking on it. Then the Audio ads start and illuminates my office with embarrassing noise. Can I please pay money for an ad free version? This is just awful and unplayable. Every time an audio ad pops up, I‚Äôll add to this scathing review. One popped up"
"6154",841098932,"This game is amazing"

"6156",841098932,"Am I blind or is there no way to redeem codes on iOS?! The store page says we can, but I can‚Äôt find any in app. I had to go to my Android device (thankfully I still have it!) in order to redeem some new codes. What is going on?"
"6157",841118013,"I loved this app when I first downloaded it but now when I watch a show it stops and says show unavailable. Please fix these problems!"

"6165",842503500,"- Can't see previous order details in app - No customer reviews - No free returns - No ""buy the look"" option for           coordinating/matching items - Needs better filtering for searches - Wishlist items don't stay with account. For      example, I deleted and reinstalled the app       because of a technical issue. Logged     back in and all of my saved items were        lost."
"6166",842617644,"I have played a lot of 1942/Strikers type games, but This one is one of the best!! I mean, WOW!  Stunning Graphics, great music, and easy movement control. I also enjoy the fact that once purchased, there are no in app extra purchases. It‚Äôs all there. The whole game. Now, you have to play to earn in game coins to upgrade your fighters, but to me, that‚Äôs the fun in it. Very well made game. I will have this on my phone for a good long time!"
"6167",842617644,"Amazing amount of content and depth for the price tag...if you are even just a causal fan of shooters like this...pick it up!!"
"6168",842617644,"The developers certainly did a nice job with this, but it is beyond limited. There are only a bunch of levels that you‚Äôll complete very quickly and it ends with a message that the game is over and you can except challenges to play with others. The only thing is NO ONE IS THERE TO PLAY A CHALLENGE WITH!    This is not what I expected or what I paid for. I wish this was not the case.  Apple needs to REMOVE THIS APP FROM THE APP STORE and I would like a REFUND MY MONEY."

"6180",845918296,"This game is very fun and I am still playing. I have ideas the first idea is if you lose zombies you could watch an ad and get em back.

Also it is really frustrating when the players don‚Äôt go for the ball or when a defender jumps up in the air and the other player won‚Äôt jump. And is it me or do your hearts go down way to fast it like I have a full set of hearts 10 minutes of playing they are gone"
"6196",847985808,"So I love this game. But I have one problem with it. Not enough to do. You attack, train troops, attack again, train more troops... it just keeps going. Any ideas for more to do?

"6204",848218959,"I know a lot of the other reviews said their were too many adds, but for me their are none! The game is absolutely perfect! Except for one thing. Why have levels? You already have points."

"6211",849095637,"I used to love this game and I wanted to play it again, but the controls make it impossible to play. I'll try to jump and it's like Thomas sticks and hits an invisible wall. It's too frustrating to play if you can't play it properly. I'm sad, this game is great with functioning controls. :( Also, screen formatting is super weird on the iPhone X, but I can't find any way to change it."
"6212",849095637,"Wow! I want it on all devices now! The game is great because the quality is very good and the levels and the story are well made!  And I can‚Äôt believe it took only 3 people to make this AMAZING game!  I‚Äôm a big fan of Thomas Was Alone!"
"6213",849095637,"This is one of the best games that I‚Äôve played in a while. I love the minimalist graphics and narration; I think that this game speaks to the storytelling capabilities of games. This game is definitely worth more than the $5 it costs."

"6218",849732663,"This app does with most only promise to do but never deliver.  It is a key tool in my every day work flow.  It is worth the time and effort to learn how it works and how to best use it so that it fits into your daily flow.

"6224",850417475,"The majority of the time, this game is enjoyable.  I like how there are several ways to earn powerups throughout. However, I don‚Äôt appreciate the game deciding that I want to use the lollipop hammer and boom it just uses it for me.  I go to make a move and there it is in play.  I didn‚Äôt want that!  Maybe ask before putting in play ‚ÄúDo you want to use this powerup?‚Äù Just like you do when I quit the game. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù Which is annoying as all get out!  Yes I clicked quit for a reason.  I am angry about this.  I work at earning those silly powerups because I will not spend money on any of my games.  Nope!  So it‚Äôs frustrating that y‚Äôall decide for me when to use them.  I‚Äôd give one star but I do like the option of videos to earn powerups and moves. ***The game keeps asking if I want to sign in Facebook so that they can share MY information.  That is unacceptable! I‚Äôm already logged in to keep my progress stored.  There is no reason they need to share my info.  I may be uninstalling this app."
"6225",850417475,"Update to this review: September 19 Your in game apps are double charging people. I made a single 3.99 purchase on 8/18. I received a bill for 2 purchases of 3.99. I have reported this to the apple store. Fix your game.  I really loved this game and played it every day. I loved the quests and the daily spins. Now it is impossible to earn rewards. You recently put in the ability to watch ads to earn boosters and/or gain lives. I was ready to stay with the game because I could finally win levels. Suddenly those are gone. I still hate the Mr. Toffee game. My best hope to clear a board is when the other players either actively participate or ignore the board. For days now another player has blocked my path. You have ruined a great game. Return the challenges and nix the Mr. Toffee."

So, apparently you have my money, but I don‚Äôt have what I paid for."

Since this is the first time I have used adobe spark video, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could not only visually see my text of the affirmations, but could record them in my own voice, was lovely music in the background. Oh JOY!! Thank you for creating this app to help me create a beautiful life!"
"6242",852555131,"I thought iMovie was great but new found app Spark Video is over the top. The features are great with a user-friendly interface. Try it and have fun with it."
"6243",852555131,"Just started using this app. I‚Äôm already addicted to how easy it is."
"6244",852801905,"Please provide English support"
"6245",852801905,"Great app!"
"6246",852801905,"Very nice!"
"6247",852912420,"Is a good game all in all, however my account got hacked because of my yahoo email account and now I can‚Äôt even access to it, is there a way in which I can possibly access to that account without the email? Or is it possible for me to transfer that account to another email without using my Facebook account, it was linked to it but it asked me for an email so I wonder if there is a possibility to recover that account. I will be waiting for your response."
"6248",852912420,"Solid well thought through game. Not stingy like many these days."
"6249",852912420,"Picked up the game to see about the Vampire Lord now I can‚Äôt stop playing"
"6250",853246110,"As other reviewers have suggested, this game is poorly balanced. I don‚Äôt have a problem with the AI, because I think it would be easier to beat if the game were designed better. The biggest problem seems to be the suspect cards that give Jack extra sandglasses, which prematurely ends the game. The detectives have 6 turns to find Jack, but if he picks up a card that gives him 2 sandglasses on the first turn and another that also gives him 2 sandglasses on the second turn, that‚Äôs game over. That‚Äôs not the AI being clever‚ÄîI can win in 2 turns doing that if I‚Äôm playing as Jack, too! Playing as Jack on any difficulty is way easier than playing as Sherlock on the easiest setting. It‚Äôs no fun when your AI opponent has the game mechanics working in their favor and you never get the full 6 turns to do your best. The suspect cards should be reworked or just removed entirely."
"6251",853246110,"I read this comment above several times before downloading and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Solid game, definitely a good puzzle, but I think it would receive a 5th star from me if I had the ability to ‚Äúundo‚Äù and go back to select a different action if I change my mind once I select the action I‚Äôm gonna do."
"6252",853246110,"Fun game, but is unstable with latest iOS."
"6253",853706620,"What game are you guys playing? This is terrible. It won‚Äôt do anything and there is no explanation of what in the world the game is about. I hate that I paid for nothing. Would be nice if the game actually did something. First board and nothing happens no matter where I tap. I want a refund!"
"6254",853706620,"Another one of these extremely incomprehensible games with too much animation, zero logic & designed merely to frustrate The player into complete madness ! Every game should start off insanely easy to give The player The encouragement to continue to The levels where playing actually begins, instead of immediately urging them to quit. $10 already forgotten, deleting this monstrosity right now!"
"6255",853706620,"It‚Äôs a good game!"
"6256",853834250,"A silly game of chance that, despite having ads before every level (and sometimes after), has a lives limit and charges outrageous rates for power ups.   Keep hunting for that whale."
"6257",853834250,"This is Peggle, but with EA's grimy hands all over the product. As a Peggle lover from the Pop Cap only days, I was excited to have Peggle on my phone to play anywhere I wanted, and for a while overlooked the Candy Crush like elements of the mobile version.  I un-installed at level 38. I had been trying to beat this level for a day, and had to wait for my lives to restock to try again. Three lives in, and I finally cleared every orange peg. Excited to move onto the next level, the game had informed me I failed because I didn't score enough points.  That isn't only ""difficulty for difficulty's sake"", which I can handle because it makes the eventual victory sweeter, but when you combine that with a lives system that encourages me to spend actual money, I'm out. I not only have to clear orange pegs, difficult enough, but now I have to make sure to have enough points too?   Pop Cap made the best small, addicting games and I basically threw money at them to get their gaming version of drugs. Now, with EA, I can't uninstall fast enough."
"6258",853834250,"EA makes really good games. Unfortunately, they are also an unconscionably greedy company."

It allows me to pick this season and my team but then it kicks me completely off the game which is getting frustrating. But I would also love to see a new mode like my career."
"6271",857555369,"This is a FANTASTIC game, and if you've never played it yet, you should most definitely grab it. I snagged the early access version on Steam and WOW! SO. MUCH. HAS. BEEN. ADDED!!! It's almost like a sequel (well, ATM, it's basically a Wayward Souls 1.5)!!!  I REALLY hope your team is able to add all of this new content to the iPhone build. Seeing as how we've all been playing the iPhone version for, what, 5 years now... I'm pretty sure that most all of us have gotten accustomed to the touchscreen controls. Even after playing with a controller on my laptop for over 6 months now, it still doesn't feel EXACTLY right, and I don't think there's anything that could be done to make it so.   Anyway.... if you're an Action RPG fan, or a sucker for sadistically difficult games :;: GET THIS. NOW!!  The touchscreen controls are spot on perfect, and I do believe they have MFi support as well (I don't know, the current version has an OS requirement too high for my iPhone 5, which is the only device that fits in my MOGA controller - so I couldn't tell you).   Out of between 5-10 THOUSAND games (Im too scared to check it out, but I've been using the AppStore for 10 years now, and there were multiple months when I spent close to $1,000) that I've downloaded from the AppStore, this is one of maybe 30 that I have made sure to ALWAYS have available to play on one of my iDevices. It's an iOS classic, and if I wasn't so emotionally attached to Secret of Mana, it'd be my #1 favorite ARPG available.   To the devs:;: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE include your mobile customers when you officially release all of the new content!! Raise the price! I'd very gladly gift this game to quite a few people that share base-reality with me, even if I knew they weren't going to enjoy it. I also have a few very close friends in other countries I would love to share it with on Steam - so once it goes live after it's early access, you can count on me buying them copies as well, regardless of wether or not the new content is brought over to mobile. You all deserve every single sale you get and then some. THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS MAGNIFICENT GAME!"
"6272",857555369,"This game freaking amazing.  It is a crime that it doesn‚Äôt get more exposure.  The gameplay is tough at first but as you play you‚Äôll see how finely tuned this game is to much your skills.  And above all, this game has more heart than anything I‚Äôve seen since Shovel Knight."
"6273",857555369,"This is still my favorite game on ios and I Uninstalled it after waiting for years for the ""paladin"" update that never came.  What happened???"

"6275",859204347,"This game is a true beauty but can we please have like bombing events that happen on the map like since it‚Äôs a war game I‚Äôd add realism to the battlefield like no people just planes bomb and have the chance to do damage"

"6284",860454499,"I just have to say, this is a good game overall. But the name has a typo ""Mud Booger"". Great physic and I give it four out of five stars."
"6285",860454499,"You don't even go mudding so why is it called mud bogger? It's a stupid game not worth it. They would have to pay me to play it."

"6289",860822992,"I love this game sooooooo much I tune into this game everyday it‚Äôs so amazing. I have been playing this game for a couple of years and I have come so far. I remember not having barely anything now I have everything I ever wanted in the game 2 cars, 9 houses, 3 working places and more. You can‚Äôt think so small minded save and spend at the same time it‚Äôs so fun, and I have never at all bought K-stars,money, or energy. Just to see how much I‚Äôve improved in the game is amazing you just have to do lots and stay focused. Like when you have the show your style events participate in those they are so fun and a good way to get a bunch of K-stars. I just really love this game and if you are thinking about getting it you better because you don‚Äôt want to miss a second of this amazing game."
"6290",860822992,"I would if I could like everyone else who is dissatisfied with a product give this game a zero star but sadly I can‚Äôt. I used to think highly of this game but now my opinion has changed due to poor customer service. I‚Äôve been paying for a Bronze VIP membership for about nine months now and never had any problems until the new update. Recently I haven‚Äôt been receiving all of my k-stars in the daily gift box and of course I brought the problem to Glu support. I told them that if they didn‚Äôt fix the situation I‚Äôd threaten to cancel my membership but that didn‚Äôt fix my situation. I spoke to two different people over the course of four days to have the first person tell me to make a new complaint ticket and the second person ask me twice if I was still not receiving the k-stars and how long had this problem been going on. I hate to say this but I had a feeling I knew it was going to be a waste of time. Glu games you just lost a customer."
"6291",860822992,"Classy.  Anyway, what‚Äôs going on with the Now Kollection consists of what I‚Äôm already wearing, and when I navigate to it, I wind up at a blank page I can‚Äôt close, or it just crashes the app? This has gone untreated for two days or more.  More universal concerns: no reliable way to change operating systems. As everyone reading this is likely aware, iOS goes through periods of being enraging or unusable. Since this game also exists on Android, I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt play the same account on Android sometimes while iOS has one of those several-month-long user-hostility tantrums. Maybe fix this right away too.  Not as important to me because I‚Äôm dull and basic: only two genders and only one body type for each. Disappointing in 2018 (UPDATE: it‚Äôs now mid-2019 and the closest thing to a solution is that some of the dresses for female characters falsely simulate the gentle hint of modest curves) especially when female characters can have the same clothes as (voluptuous and body-positive) Kim Kardashian but have to remain stick-thin no matter what. Strange comparison to incessantly bludgeon the user with.  UPDATE: The UX has somehow found a way to be MORE of a nightmare? If you‚Äôre a loyal player like I am, you probably have a lot of clothes and accessories. When taking part in contests like Show Your Style, it would be nice to have a few quality-of-life improvements to make organization a lot easier (read: it is essential that drastic changes be made immediately). There used to be a grey tag on clothes that you had just submitted that let you know at a glance what you would have to wait a couple days to use again. That tag has been missing from the past two Show Your Style contests. The tag is not enough to keep navigating the vast and cumbersome sufficiently user-friendly, but removing it was a stupid mistake and it needs to come back before I log back into the game in a few minutes. Also, an undo button cannot be implemented quickly enough (refer to imvu to see how it‚Äôs done), because as you navigate, the game misinterprets a TON of touch screen dragging as taps. Also, Accessories and Miscellany absolutely must, as soon as possible, be further subdivided into earrings, necklaces, rings, left wrist, right wrist, et cetera. Lastly (FOR NOW), let‚Äôs have one of those elevator thingies on the side of long, scrolling menus, that let you easily tell how far down a too-long list you‚Äôve navigated. Like... every app with a long list of characters or cards or whatever has one of these things. Microsoft Word has utilized this feature for decades and the fact that the Kardashian game doesn‚Äôt have one is felt like a gunshot in your shoulder.  So fix these mistakes like quick. Like literally before tomorrow. Then we can talk about other no-brainer quality-of-life necessities this game has somehow SURVIVED FIVE YEARS without providing.  (To be clear, nobody should be taking part in Show Your Style until the UX is fixed. I know I won‚Äôt, and I also know that I‚Äôve spent quite a bit of money to take part in Show Your Style, so I genuinely hope that a good boycott acts as a game-fixing gadfly to these greedy developers.)  UPDATE: Need more of a warning that there‚Äôs a special event on than a vague, solitary, and missable push notification that merely mentioned that Fashion Week is happening. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure that the push came hours after the event had started. Why not let us know a few days in advance that an event is coming up? Or, like the games that are doing this right are doing, a week or more in advance?"
"6292",861891048,"I used to use this app until it became so ridiculous, offering things that I don‚Äôt need, trying to force you to upgrade to VIP by removing more features, fake profiles are everywhere in this app even you can get banned by anyone who can report you without you doing anything wrong, it‚Äôs just getting so annoying and becoming a horrible experience."

"6294",861891048,"Do not download!  I have had this app for 6 months now. Didn‚Äôt use it a lot until this last week. More spam and fake accounts than real ones. Yes some are real but a lot of fake accounts. They want me to invest in bitcoin or download Skype to extort you.  My favorite yet they add you and say nothing."
"6295",862303071,"I played this for quite awhile and suddenly it started all over then I tried to start to play it several times again and it kept starting back at the beginning again... I really enjoyed it while it was working. I sent messages but no response."

The game is easily grindable (not a word lol) and if you play enough, you can level easily. That is until you hit the 50‚Äôs. However, I think it would be fun to add a story mode to each character to play through. A side mission of course. Doesn‚Äôt have to be long, just a bonus for Awakening the character. Also, add speed options when auto continue is on, like they have in Brave Frontier. That would be really helpful. I‚Äôve managed to awaken 3 characters in a short period of time.

"6344",868123351,"Fun game but hard to score a goal. I think penalty kicks should be added to make the game not so repetitive because if there aren't penalty kicks then the golden goal period keeps going on and I highly suggest adding penalty kicks"
"6345",868123351,"The game is fun to play, but the system is a bit whack. You pretty much can't score a goal point blank.  The only goals I can score so far out of three matches are rebound goals, where you put the ball in the net after the goalie has blocked it."

"6362",869869881,"This game snatches your attention from the start! The artwork in every scene is amazing. This was the best game I have ever played on a cell phone!! I love puzzle games and to find out in the end that my choices actually affected the outcome, I was pleasantly surprised!! I plan to tell anyone who‚Äôs willing to listen about this game!! Thank you so much developers for the awesome experience that you so wonderfully provided!! Please make more games! PLEASE!!!"
"6363",869869881,"This was a very interesting point click adventure. It is not a difficult as some other click point adventures as I have done but the storyline was more interesting and deep.

I will tell anyone and everyone to use this app. I am a fan. And this from a person that is not a computer person. Don‚Äôt fall for the bad reviews.

Like food places, rest stops, and the gas station have like that inside part with food and whatever, it would be awesome to add that stuff, also police, signs like yeld, stop, keep left,ETC. That‚Äôd be awesome! I‚Äôm a bored ten year old like others on here, but I haven‚Äôt played this game in years!

"6381",871694174,"So I‚Äôve bought nearly all of the Toca life apps and I‚Äôm very impressed. I love playing doll house type games on my phone, and Toca has made the best games as far as I can tell. I got Toca life: world, and it‚Äôs the best idea, to combine all of the apps into one. But, then I went to the police station and it‚Äôs still the same old police station from this app. I think it needs a remodel, or maybe a new, larger police station in Toca world. Like maybe more prison cells, and possibly a cell that has an escape tunnel in it. Also maybe more officers and more colorful, crazy criminals. In another play house app, players could wash and design the police car, then take it out for a spin and capture a criminal. THAT WOULD BE SOOO COOL. I was also thinking you could create a fire department, and a house that caught on fire so kids could then rescue people from the building and put out the fire. And maybe the classic cat in a tree could be in that app too. I hope you take a look at these suggestions, cuz I‚Äôve been thinking bout them for a lonnnggg time. THANKS, bye."

"6384",871809581,"I love this game but now I don‚Äôt play it anymore because you‚Äôre made to watch an ad before every single replay attempt. I spend more time watching ads than playing the game and it‚Äôs just not even worth it anymore. Maybe if they did an ad every 5 games or so it wouldn‚Äôt be so obnoxious?"
"6385",872424895,"I remember a vid of an early version of this game where the rx7 rotary went brap brap brap but when I downloaded the game is sounded nothing like I expected which kinda made me like the game less but here is a suggestion of a car u should add it‚Äôs a green rx3 call MUTANT"

"6388",873008064,"This would be great for presentations if it had an auto restart -- when countdown hits zero, vibrate 2 times then restart the counter. Useful for other activities, like gym, where you want to move from task to task. Would also be nice if it could set time in seconds. Add those 2 features and I'd give it 5 stars."

"6395",874845056,"The game is great. The graphics are fantastic. But I personally think you guys should make ones with bike and scooters and add whole skate parks like Woodward skaters edge"
"6396",874845056,"This is the best mobile skate game out hands down. It‚Äôs the most control over the board once you figure it out. But my only qualm is, why aren‚Äôt they continuing with this and making more levels. The levels they have are cool, but that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no further to go. I feel like they could be capitalizing on this app big time. But maybe the creators have moved on."
"6397",875063456,"This app is so great. It has helped me so much and I just got it! The rewards and cool graphics really add to the learning experience and makes me want to play more."
"6398",875063456,"I love this game and find it extremely helpful!  That said, I would love if we could have an option to have the daily training session be more than five games; it doesn‚Äôt seem like a hard thing to implement at all."
"6399",875063456,"This app is invigorating! Sharpens the mind but does not dull the blade with an exuberant amount of work. Purchasing the app has increased my desire to do more than the daily exercises to practice areas I need strength!"

However, after upgrading to iOS 10.3 today, I got an alert on the screen that this app would stop working with the next iOS upadate if the developers don't upgrade this app. So, I would request the app developers to kindly upgrade this useful app."

"6415",876054082,"The app from 5 years ago is still superior to this app.  It seems with every update they remove more and more features.  Now projects don‚Äôt update throughout the game.  The app looks cooler, it just doesn‚Äôt have near the features of its competitors."
"6416",876054082,"I see what they tried to do with the NEW UPDATE, create a fantasy/fun looking app while also being as INFORMATIONAL as possible but its so TRASH.  It moves SLOWER THAN ANY OTHER APP ON MY PHONE. TOUCH REGISTRATION is SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED. and FUNCTIONALITY MAKES NO SENSE (ex: why cant i make a 2 for 1 trade and decide who im dropping, to make space for the two players, all on the same screen? And why does it not automatically update scores while im playing someone? I constantly have to refresh to get the new score)  If NOTHING GETS BETTER between now and end of season, I‚Äôll switch to ESPN app or SLEEPER app."

I‚Äôve downloaded it deleted it re-downloaded it turn off my phone turned back on tried it on Wi-Fi and LTE it just will not let me get to the campaign or any of the buttons. Which is very sad because I absolutely loved the game recently lost dollars"
"6474",880971164,"Overall great game. Smooth textures, good controls, just amazing feel. I have been a huge fan of assassin's Creed ever since two came out. I love this game I do but I escorted Leonardo Da Vinci to safety got the second challenge for the mission and I was happy then it said connection error. I was connected to WiFi I tried to retry several times and just had to back out of the mission to the Animus. It has happened on a few missions and I do love the game it's just those issues."

"6482",881270303,"I love XCOM but playing on an XR and with the latest iOS, I am finding it buggy to the point of being unplayable. I am on the second mission and have found that I cannot move a solider or get him to do anything.

"6483",881270303,"I was so excited to play this game as I was a huge fan of xcom 2 on my Xbox one but man I can‚Äôt even get past the first level after the tutorial because of the buggy controls. My main complaint is the cursor elevation simply does now work. My touch screen doesn‚Äôt recognize the command (two fingers swiping or pulling down) and I end up sitting a swiping for 5 minutes trying to get my soldier to either climb up or climb down from his post. It‚Äôs really disheartening since I was eager to play it on my new phone and have a genuine console style game that I could play while having downtime offshore."

"6500",882248810,"Although I‚Äôm spoiled by ‚ÄúLittle Crane‚Äù, this is no where close - maybe a 99 cents app.  It‚Äôs one-dimensional and somewhat boring.  No big deal. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
"6501",882248810,"This is a game for children and adults alike.  From the minute I began playing it, I couldn't put it down.  So many levels with progressive difficulty; yet not difficult enough to make me want to quit. The graphics are excellent, and I really enjoy this physics-based type of game.  It's fun, challenging, and I highly recommend for kids from 5 to 105!  A great departure from all the mindless, thoughtless other stuff that's out there.  Great job!"

"6509",882507985,"A nice game, but the last update took out clan chat."
"6510",882507985,"Dragon mania legends is the best mobile game I‚Äôve ever played, there‚Äôs nothing I would change about it! But I do have an idea for a new feature. You should put in wether. Like, every so often it would rain then clear up after a while. The sky would become grey and maybe some thunder if the player had sound on. But you would also have the option to turn wether off in settings. And the rain would vary from island to island, like the main grassy one would be normal rain, the sand one would have no rain, just grey sky, the swamp/marsh one would be slightly foggy with rain, and polar rock would snow, etc. (sorry I don‚Äôt know all the names of the islands) maybe you could also add day and night to, with the option to turn it off, where it would include sunrise and set, day and night. And at night the dragons habitats would slightly light up to produce light. And maybe certain decorations would produce light at night.  I know this all probably won‚Äôt happen but if you read it all then thanks! And I hope you like the idea :)"

"6513",882931712,"THIS STUPID APP IS CRAP DONT BUY IT IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY IT IS UNFAIR AND UNREASONABLE"
"6514",883144212,"I really liked this game. For me it somehow had a big realm atmosphere for such a relatively small game, perhaps due to nice music, a smattering of decent sound effects, smooth 3D travel, a quick travel map, great graphics, and a good dose of subtle humor in many of the descriptions (kinda reminded me of some old text adventures). I found the puzzles to be well varied, pretty logical, and mostly intuitive. A couple extra slider puzzles, yes, but didn‚Äôt mind them til I got to the end. Honestly, that one was about as much fun as putting together a jigsaw puzzle with the same picture on both sides. Other than that, only got stumped a couple times, but pushed through without the hints and felt pretty satisfied when I finished, except for the lack of closure with the end story. No matter; after all, I wasn‚Äôt reading a novel, just playing a short, entertaining puzzle game, and I‚Äôm glad I did."
"6515",883144212,"I did not find that there were to many sliding puzzles in this game. I found a diversity of fetching items to unlock doors and mechanical sliding puzzles. There were mazes and other types of puzzles dispersed throughout the games. It was worth a buck and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The last puzzle was an absolute nightmare but it was so satisfying to solve. I recommend this game for puzzle adventure enthusiasts."
"6516",883144212,"It was great to begin with, then I got further into the game and found more and more 'bugs.' I got stuck on the ""26"" puzzle. Finally got to the clue that told me which two numbers to plug in where and found out the clue was wrong after working on the puzzle for quite some time. Ok, fine. Kept going and got to the maze puzzle. Here you had to use the tilt shift of your device to complete the puzzle, and no matter what I did I could not get this to work. The balls absolutely did NOT go in the direction my device was tilted whatsoever. I even tried locking and unlocking the orientation. After trying and ultimately getting annoyed I quit and deleted the game unfinished."
"6517",883179733,"I don't usually take out time to review apps but I've been using this app for all my finances and I've got to say I've never been happier. Simple and easy to use.   Thank You Qi Wang :D"

"6524",883393043,"Yea the graphics are cool, but apparently most of the ppl leaving reviews have LOTS of money to spare. This game is absolutely ridiculous how they literally make it impossible to win tournaments unless you spend real money. It takes FOREVER to upgrade cars unless, again, you spend real money. And I love how adding a new part gives you a few extra PR in regular game play, but in tournaments you have to install 2-3 parts just to get ONE more PR. NOTHING BUT A MONEY TRAP!!!"
"6525",883393043,"It‚Äôs a slap in the face of NFS fans to call this game ‚ÄúNo Limits‚Äù when absolutely everything you do it dictated by several currency‚Äôs and your  ability or lack there of to earn them.   You need gas.  You need gold.  You need performance points  You need cash!   You need blueprints   You need to wait for this and that..  The gameplay is awesome, but there are many many limitations in this game. What a JOKE."
"6526",884009993,"I‚Äôve used this app multiple times before and it‚Äôs always been absolutely amazing! I recently downloaded it again but this time, I can‚Äôt sign in at all. So I‚Äôve tried making a new account but once I try to put in a username, it pops up with Error Unknown. So I tried making a video without signing in but some of the landscape pictures I put into it, gets pushed to the side so that there‚Äôs a black space next to the photo instead of the photo being fully there on the screen. I know this app is awesome and I absolutely love it! It‚Äôs just that the recent bugs have been a real bummer and ruining the reputation of this app. So please fix this as soon as possible. Thanks!"

"6531",884023735,"I had been struggling to find a suitable program to transfer my data to my phone with no success. I was in a rather odd situation, where I had data on one phone from four months ago and past that, and data on the other phone from those four months until now.

"6542",885823239,"I‚Äôve lost out on many items because they were stuck in chests. The problem I‚Äôm having now that I‚Äôm gettin really tired of is even when you kill all the enemies, the next checkpoint won‚Äôt clear for you to go through. So you wasted energy and a personal co-op person because of the glitchy missions. I‚Äôm the type that doesn‚Äôt spend my real money on games so the fact that this game is almost unplayable sometimes is annoying. Also, during raid, when you let your fighter freelance fight, he will be almost finish eliminating all the enemies and then stop and go to attacking the elements of the map. Fix the AI in raid PLEASE. It‚Äôs awful and I can‚Äôt trust it. Also freelance fighting in trial of elements is buggy because your character constantly wants to try and fight the enemies THROUGH the stairs. Yeah, if you guys could fix all that please, that‚Äôd be great."
"6543",885823239,"This is the worst game I‚Äôve ever played in my phone. Every single time I tried to do anything, the tutorial forces you to try the next part or aspect of the game.  I cannot check or level any equipment, I cannot change weapons, and I cannot do anything I want to do.   This is not the first game in the series and it is not the first game of this type.

"6551",886212870,"I loved these games. I loved the old school feel of them and the general noir atmosphere I felt as I was playing. They were fun to play, and sometimes frustrating, but overall I loved getting to know the characters and feeling inside of their world."
"6552",886212870,"I knew this game felt familiar. It's exactly like one of their other games I didn't care for, Shiva. Oy. The game plays by itself. It doesn't need you. So much dialog and virtually no play time, unless you think playtime is being instructed of your next clue or location to go to and going there only to be in another pointless dialog for 20 minutes. There is nothing fun here. It's not cutesy, it's not interesting, the female doesn't speak in a way of normal speech flows. You're pointing, you're clicking, you're being led to each next screen and just doing what you're told. Not quite an adventure game. From my perspective it's Shiva in another form and someone will need to sit Shiva for me after this game is over."

"6560",886697025,"I‚Äôve had this app for years. It‚Äôs a really well-designed concept and useful tool for artists. But at this point it is long overdue for an update with its content 3D models. By comparison apps like Daz3D (likely used in the design of this app.), and its muscle definition and joint movement has long since passed the model‚Äôs capabilities in this app. The models have very unnatural joint bends in any thing resembling real athletic or dance poses, for example.  Please update!! I would easily give this app 5 Stars, with new and improved models with more realistic flexibility and joint and muscle definition."
"6561",886697025,"A very useful tool. It takes a bit of time to figure out how to accurately maneuver the poses. I‚Äôm a Sculptor and I simply love that I can twirl around the figure to any angle, even if the graphics are a little oversimplified.

"6571",887947640,"Let‚Äôs get the big topic out of the way. This game is a money milking machine. Natural Motion or the big dogs up top known as Zynga are some of the worst in the mobile gaming market. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it aligns up perfectly with its competition being NFS no limits and Asphalt 9. Both of which are just as bad in terms of ‚Äúmilking it‚Äù.  So let‚Äôs go into detail as to why I‚Äôm leaving this 2 star review. I doubt it‚Äôll matter but here it goes. I was a hardcore player for several months. I enjoyed the game a lot and I had a great crew. That was until Natural Motion started shoving more paid events into the game. As time went on most of my crew mates grew tired of having to pay to complete certain events. Natural Motion decided to ramp up the difficultly on the free to play events so people are more inclined to spend money.  Practically everything has became a paid event at this point because you‚Äôre either locked out until you buy a certain car or you‚Äôre stuck in an event due to the difficulty increase. Natural Motion believes this is what players want. They believe that this is fair. Speaking of fair let‚Äôs discuss my most recent discussion with their in game support team.  In the past I paid for some fate of the furious cars. Enough of them to complete the ice charger event. I spent a good amount of resources to complete it as well. I won the car and at the time I had it nearly maxed out. Like I said before I was having trouble with my crew. I burnt through all my resources and no one was active enough to help me build them back up. I started losing seasonal milestone cars and then rewards because they were leaving.   Just recently I decided I wanted to start a new save file not taking into account that I should probably write down my previous player ID. When I got through with the tutorial I realized my fate of the furious cars that I paid money for were returned to me (without upgrades S6s or fusions). I went to share this on the official Sub Reddit where someone suggested I ask support about getting my ice charger back as I did pay money to complete the event (had to buy the cars to be able to play in it) seeing as I owned all the cars I used for the event on this new account I figured it was worth a shot.   I contacted support and told them in very clear detail that I had changed save files and would like my ice charger back going over that I had the other cars on my account and I was suggested to bring it up by some other players. Support got back to me with the response of ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt give out free cars as we focus on keeping the game fair for everyone. Keep an eye out for future offers‚Äù <- (this means give us your money)  Anyways to end off with my 2 star review I‚Äôd like to make a statement. This game isn‚Äôt fair what so ever. A good majority of the top players are well known hackers and cheaters yet Natural Motion and Zynga do absolutely nothing about it. They proceed to shove paid events down your throat and raise the difficulty level of events overtime so more people are forced to pay if they want to finish these events. The only thing fair is the fact that most players along with myself are tired of this crap.   If you think Natural Motion or Zynga needs your money do not worry as they‚Äôre already filthy stinking rich."

"6595",890358046,"The input is very intuitive, more so than another notation app I bought for iPad. Unfortunately, after paying for it I discovered too many bugs which have not yet been addressed.  1. Copy and paste function is terrible!  When copying a bar to another bar it doesn‚Äôt put the notes where they were in the copied measure, they get transposed all differently depending on where you touch the screen, so you have to sort of guess where to tap the screen, and if you guessed wrong, which you probably will do most of the time, you have to copy all over again and try to paste in the right spot, which is ridiculous.  PLEASE FIX THIS!!!  2. Playback tool is too limited.  This should be more like a standard playback tool with rewind and fast-forward controls not just play and stop.  Also there should be a way to have it play back in swing like other notation programs can.   3.  The sound is buggy. Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work, and the only way to get it back is for me to restart my iPad. I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that, the sound should be more robust than that.  4.  There are some basic articulation‚Äôs and phrase markings which don‚Äôt exist in this app, such as marcato, falls, and glissando.  I would be happy to write a more positive review if these items could be addressed and if the maker or makers of this software would show more interest in supporting it with more frequent updates as these problems are brought to their attention by users like myself who actually paid for it."
"6596",890358046,"Have been using this app for on the go composing. Very useful once you get comfortable with the input methods. However this needs an update for the new iPad Pros (2018) so the app will display edge to edge. Also with the iPad Pros now supporting midi keyboards, note input via an external midi keyboard would be game changing."
"6597",890358046,"EXPORT FAILS - by any method.  What kind of notating software allows one to use an SATB template but not enter lyrics?  I‚Äôve paid for the whole package, and no lyrics?  Massive shortcoming.  Other shortcomings: 1. Cannot search the help utility by keyword.  Many sub-level menu items hidden under parent items but not listed in tree form in the table of contents.  2. Cannot export Midi ‚Äòparts‚Äô.  3. Cannot export mp3 renderings of Midi.  4. Cannot specify beginning measure number.  5. Copy and paste an expression - THEN BE ABLE TO EDIT THE EXPRESSION, else have to create new every time and unify format, say, if one is creating measure numbers because program lacks item 4 above.  6. Do NOT link song listing to Title property.  If I wish to maintain several revisions, I should not have to edit the Title in order to tell the difference between versions."
"6598",890378044,"I‚Äôve been playing this game for years and love it. I don‚Äôt understand the complaints about buying items. I gain boosters by earning chests and can always eventually win each level without buying anything. It‚Äôs my favorite game!"

These guys must be raking in the money as it is the only way you can play this game in any sort of enjoyable fashion.  Minimum $25 for unlimited lives for only 6 hours.  Minimal turns that make it impossible to pass the levels presented unless you have booster toys.  Rockets that move in the exact opposite direction you need them to go.  Once you do spend money, you magically pass the level you couldn‚Äôt pass prior after multiple attempts. There is absolutely no way this game isn‚Äôt a complete and utter scam.  Don‚Äôt get sucked into it- it‚Äôs a bottomless pit. I hope someone takes them to court over it someday because it‚Äôs complete absurdity that apps can do this to the public."

"6679",892812659,"I have often wanted to play an iOS game that reminds me of one of my SNES favorites from childhood, Uncharted Waters. This fits the bill and more with its steampunk style. Love it!"
"6680",892812659,"So that app has not been update in over a year. Just went to play it and it‚Äôs stuck on ‚ÄúIt would seem...‚Äù for over 5 min. Deleted the app and downloaded it again.   Please fix this since I‚Äôve paid for this app already or a refund would be nice."

"6682",892955084,"This app is ingenious and amazing!   There are so many different roles to play, and whether town or mafia, most of them are entertaining! It‚Äôs incredibly exciting to interact with other people and try to figure out who may be fibbing or concealing information. It‚Äôs imperative not to trust anyone... you don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs going to backstab you in the end! Sometimes, the dynamic of it all can be quite thrilling, almost like a real mystery. While it may be overwhelming to get the hang of at first, Mafia is easy to master once you have the basics down. There are so many complex strategies to put into play no matter what side you‚Äôre given! The game will make you laugh with pleasure of getting away with something, or seriously resolve to better yourself after suffering defeat. And since every set-up and interaction is different, you never know what kind of game you‚Äôre going to get!  I personally appreciate the game so much. I‚Äôve had it for over a year now, and I‚Äôm still learning more with every login. I meet so many people who impress me wildly with their tactics, and since the community is always growing, you‚Äôve never met them all! Overall, the app challenges my mind and entertains me at the same time. What more could you want?  (Well, maybe one request. It‚Äôd be hilarious if there were a Fool chat. Hahaha üòä)"

"6685",893141226,"Low rating for leaving old phones behind. No reason for this. Can't download the latest version, only the last compatible version. Shame on you developers. Used to love this game, but I can't stand staring at the 1 on my App Store that won't go away."

"6698",893448956,"I am playing this game on an iPhone X, and instead of using all the screen space, the app just treat my phone like a 7, and blank out the extra length, making the control very inconvenient. That being said, it‚Äôs a good game with cute graphics and intelligent mechanics. I saw that the dev updates the game a year ago, but can they please update it to fit newer models?"
"6699",893448956,"I really enjoy the artwork and how many different combinations of teams you can have our round. The difficulty curve is just right. Really a great take on tower defense"

It looked promising because of the good reviews and the first screenshot advertises you can choose your allergies!

I have over 20 uncommon food allergies to common ingredients such as carrots, potatoes, chicken/beef, etc... and my feed is mostly foods I put I very disliked. I assume it‚Äôs like this to get you to try to like these foods with good recipes but I need to avoid these foods. I wonder if the developers can add custom foods to the allergen list or an unlimited amount of foods disliked and actually filter the lists so recipes show up without those items. Thank you."

"6771",897446215,"Edit: The business cards turned good. That weren‚Äôt as crisp as I thought they would be but I think that might have been the printing service. I still use Canva and referred family and friends to it. But one thing, like I said I have the subscription but on the website it acts as if I don‚Äôt and tries to charge me for the graphics. So I go to the app for my graphics. I‚Äôve been also having issues editing text on the app as well. I find myself going back and forth between the website and app.  I hope that gets fixed along with the occasional blurriness, other than that, the app would be great.  I use Canva for all my product design. I have a bakes and confections shop and I love the designs I‚Äôve come up with on here. I have the $12.99 subscription so I‚Äôm expecting the product to be consistent. Sometimes when downloading from Canva, the image is blurry which is annoying.  Even when using images and texts from Canva it‚Äôs self, it‚Äôs still blurry. I used a design I made on Canva for my new business cards so we‚Äôll see how clear they print up.

"6791",898838405,"The game crashes when playing in tournament. I walked have won the but it crash 3 times cause me to come in second due to lost rounds. If they fix that would give them a five stars."
"6792",898838405,"21 years of working for the U. S. Army.  This game is the most realistic I've ever been involved in.  I enjoy very much the camaraderie between players.  I try to  battle opponents inthe game every day. Hooah!!!"

"6796",899193797,"iPad is running iOS 12 and every time we open the feelings photo booth, the app shuts down suddenly. It worked fine on the previous version of iOS."
"6797",899193797,"When I was little, I started playing this game but a little crashes developer. Hope you can fix the tiny bug."
"6798",899193797,"This app is very very fun. The best part is the drawing part. It is so fun."
"6799",899247664,"The dang app doesn‚Äôt even work! I can‚Äôt redeem a code because it removes letters"
"6800",899247664,"I just learned about this app today. I used to be really addicted to a game called osu, but couldn‚Äôt play it anymore since now I only have a iPad and phone. But this morning my friend showed me this app which allowed me to get back into Osu beta, I love it since some pc games are getting ported to mobile and you can try it early with this. Love it!"
"6801",899247664,"I didn‚Äôt get an invitation code"
"6802",899277186,"Beautifully rendered app. The interface is easy and the graphics are smooth and look great.        No, this probably won‚Äôt help you with any kind of troubleshooting or simulated engine modification.        Yes! It‚Äôs the best portable app I‚Äôve seen to show someone the basics of what‚Äôs going on when they fire up their car. Plus, if you‚Äôre a gear head, it‚Äôs just fun to look at now and then.       As another reviewer said, I‚Äôd like to see some diesels added including the opposing piston type. Perhaps a gas rotary piston engine. I‚Äôd also like removable layers for distributors/ignition modules, cam/crank position sensors, and spark plug wires.  I‚Äôd even be willing to pay a reasonable amount to add these features to my existing app. I‚Äôll update to 5 if this ever happens!"
"6803",899277186,"Please add the following: turbocharger/supercharger,W formation,16 cylinders and the ability to search for an engine"
"6804",899277186,"I love the game very much so but if we could make turbos and boost pressure a thing I‚Äôd love a dyno tuning set up so I can see how much power is being put out and for the customer and consumer alike I‚Äôd like really high revving engines based on the crankshaft size that would make the game much better and a sweet shifting pattern you Could by for a dollar with the dyno for a dollar üíµ it is my dream to make Custom engines this game reminds me of opening up my own shop"
"6805",899441948,"Does anyone else have the problem that Toto wants to take a bath/shampoo all the time? Very frustrating for the grandkids. I'm using an iPad.  Developers, PLEASE FIX. I have asked before!"
"6806",899441948,"The turtle Toto is charming, and you can take care of him. I like how you click on the egg to hatch him. You can interact with a few things in each room/ floor he is in such as a bed for making Toto sleep, a ice cream maker to feed him, and an area to give him a bath.   There‚Äôs also a item menu at the bottom that you can use too for more interactions with Toto. However, once you go to all of the floors of the house you realize there isn‚Äôt anything new left to do after that."
"6807",899441948,"Just call it Toto‚Äôs tree house. Because I want the giant panda toy to be his punching batterler and please change the stupid music on the radio üìª to be disco music that‚Äôs for any age any size because I love disco music instead of baby music because it is so dumb. And one more thing, invite some friends over to his house even Woody woodpecker because he is so cute. I hate the other games but I am keeping this one.

I attacked the lions and me and my family drank from the pond. The next day, it was even hotter! I found a pond with no water in it! I traveled far and wide to try to find the freshest, cleanest water. After a few hours I finally found some fresh water. Now that I can smell water, me and my family will never have to be thirsty again.                                              THE END!"

"6823",900333528,"This app is good for calorie or carb tracking. It has most of the foods I‚Äôm looking for and it is easy enough to input what I can‚Äôt find in their system. I would love to see an area for recipes and fitness tracking.  Also, it says it‚Äôs connected to my Apple Watch, but I‚Äôm not sure what that feature does."
"6824",900333528,"I love being able to track my dietary intake.  The app let me set my allowable carbs, fats, and proteins as well as my daily points.  So I am able to follow a Keto diet using the app.  The one thing I can‚Äôt do is delete a food after I save it.  This is either a glitch in the app or I just haven‚Äôt been able to find where to go to delete it.  I over came the problem by just setting the serving size to zero so it doesn‚Äôt count."
"6825",900333528,"App is a good replacement for WW at a fraction of the cost but it does require some additional explanations. It also will not sync with other devices but I can live with that. Really don‚Äôt understand the macros and some of the servings and how they are calculated. All is all it does the trick"
"6826",900404152,"This game is very realistic. One thing that stands out from other dev‚Äôs flight sims is that this one has many functional panels. It is more realistic than any other flight simulator I‚Äôve seen on the App Store. I‚Äôll sometimes pretend I‚Äôm the pilot when I‚Äôm on a plane and set in our actual takeoff and landing airports, and it‚Äôs awesome!"

"6837",901500107,"This version of the app does handle setting the privacy for use of microphone and camera so you can‚Äôt create your own flashcards."

"6842",901787752,"I have an IPhone Xs and i cant see my gold. The part where the camera is just blocks that part of the screen. Unfortunate yes, but I‚Äôm still gonna play this a bunch"
"6843",901787752,"Ok I don‚Äôt tend to like games similar to this were you collect hero‚Äôs and then go through multiple levels doing nothing and this game kind of does it but it hides it really well at hides it as a D&D campaign and if your fan of that game you might want to try this one the game does remind you a lot that you can buy stuff with diamonds but your not forced and you get diamonds every once in awhile by level 13 for me I had enough Diamonds to get a story the only thing I want from this game is a bard class that‚Äôs free to help with grinding witch is a downside because you grind a lot but I like it so eh give it a try it‚Äôs fun"
"6844",902026228,"There used to be free options now like every other greedy person out there they have decided your kids can only have a chat or call if you have money! I live below poverty level and this means I can no longer use this app for my kids."
"6845",902026228,"I‚Äôve paid for maybe 3 apps in the past. This app is free but has an in app purchase option to get all the premium videos and calls. Worth every penny. A direct line to Santa. Santa has helped us out even after the holiday season. Sometimes kids need a little help remembering to listen, pick up their toys or to go to bed when they are told. Santa can help encourage them to do that. Even when it‚Äôs not Christmas, kids tend to listen to Ol‚Äô Saint Nick. I love this app, and when it‚Äôs time to renew my premium content purchase for the upcoming holiday season, I won‚Äôt hesitate. If you need a great app that puts you in touch with Santa himself, try our this one and you‚Äôll be good to go."
"6846",902026228,"Love the app!"
"6847",902062673,"32530 shots later I reached the end. 10000+ holes and I‚Äôm bummed that it ended since I was enjoying it so much. Thank you"
"6848",902062673,"This game has been my literal no-brainer game for several years. It‚Äôs small and simple design has kept me coming back for more. The occasional changes in landscape, be it a cactus, a cloud, a color shift, brought an element of satisfaction simply because of their rarity. It was a joy to see something new. A reminder of how pleasant the simple things of life can be.   However, upon reaching hole 10,000 today at 26,476 strokes, something new I did not expect occurred. Hole 10,001 did not generate. Instead I found myself on the shore of an endless ocean. Hmm, I thought. Perhaps it‚Äôs a fluke? So I rebooted the app and there was still no new hole. I hit the ball into the ocean, and the ball vanished beneath the water and did not regenerate again. I no longer have a ball to hit. Nor a hole to shoot for. The game promised infinity, but the game literally ending like this exactly at hole 10,000 seems like it‚Äôs an ending by design. If not, the game has broken at hole 10,001 and I‚Äôd like to keep playing. As far as endings go, I will say this does seem like a very appropriate ending for this simple game."
"6849",902062673,"Supposed to be relaxing but one of the levels (826) was near impossible and completely ruined the par average. Complete garbage."
"6850",902720170,"Great game so far"

"6857",903183877,"Clearly work went into this but it‚Äôs just not fun to play."
"6858",903183877,"This game is great, but whenever I reach a two or three minutes my game crashes."
"6859",903418970,"Okay so I think this game is Annoying because all the baby‚Äôs are BOYS!! And because I think kids like under 7 SHOULD NOT play this game they don‚Äôt need to know about pregnancy!!"
"6860",903418970,"I love it it's adorable"

"6866",903911740,"So in all fairness I haven‚Äôt made anything yet from the app. But I‚Äôm a expert plant-based cook so I know good recipes when I see them. App is also very easy to use. Highly recommend for anyone seeking to be more intentional about what they eat."

"6868",904013027,"Amazing game, super fun to play even solo, but I came across a pretty big glitch regarding the new Alien Presents mission. I don't have Alien Technologies, but I somehow selected the Alien Presents mission and the selection registered and saved. However, now my game crashes whenever I do anything in the ""New Mission"" tab. I can't switch mission to either of the vanilla missions (Doubles and Batteries or the normal presents mission), since that crashes the game, and I can't even hit the X button because that crashes the game too! The deck selection is missing, likely because there are no decks available without buying the expansion, and I can't start an Alien Presents game, since even that crashes the game. Everything else appears to remain functional, and I'm playing my vanilla turn-based games without any problems. I can even start new non-mission games!  Still, I don't want to wait ten days for the mission to expire. Could I have some help getting off this mission?  Edit: LOL I CAN JOIN OTHER ALIEN PRESENTS GAMES AND ONE OF THEM STARTED have fun patching this out"

"6871",904052407,"I was so happy to know and app like this existed, until I finally purchased a ticket through them. I just lost $1500 due to their lack of transparency with their transactions.  The ticket I bought through them, never said that I could not exchange it nor that it had ANY restrictions howsoever. The airline that I flew with told me that my ticket had all kinds of restrictions such ‚Äî I can‚Äôt change my return date because we bought the cheapest option through hopper and that if we wouldn‚Äôt have use hopper, we could have exchange the dates directly with them.   At no point while I was purchasing this ticket I was shown this during the check out process.   We contacted hopper about this issue and they were in no way helpful. We are yet still to see the fine print or where those restrictions where listed when we purchase the tickets with them.  We are taking them to court as this is completely unacceptable and unreasonable not to respond with a positive outcome but to ‚Äúapologize‚Äù.   I have no return ticket due to their lack of transparency. This is a company with no moral integrity."
"6872",904052407,"I was booking a RT flight, all done and attempted to purchase. That is when I started to hate Hopper. Went up to the purchase and window says we recognize you, why not sign in? Okay, so  I clk on the window, now I need to fill out all the same info I have already completed. Then I get the text to confirm it is me. Nothing after I hit the link. I am suddenly back to filling the whole thing out again to sign in. So I faithfully fill it out...again...hit the link on the text...again...and back to the future I go to fill it all out againü§¨ Luckily the THIRD TIME I FILL IT OUT AND THE LINK WORKS.  It was the last time I would have ever used Hopper if it hadn‚Äôt worked that last time. Life is hard enough without having to fill out the same info a total of four times before it works."

"6874",904207373,"Colors need to be updated so people with mild deuteranomaly color blindness can play. At least let us know ahead of starting a game whether we are playing against one other color or two other colors. Sometimes I can‚Äôt tell until I‚Äôve lost that there I was actually playing against two different yellows, for example.  I really like this game, but the update to the daily challenge makes it extremely rare for me to be able to win now, because every game in the challenge is different, and if I misidentify colors in just one, I‚Äôm out.  Sometimes using night mode helps, but not always.  Please consider this type of update for this game: I have noticed another game or two listing this improvement while updating game apps."
"6875",904207373,"Just wish the colors had more contrast. Sometimes the colors are too close to distinguish. Otherwise, great game."
"6876",904207373,"Not a lot has changed other than more videos to annoy you and eat more if your mobile bill each month.  Not into videos that basically cost me to watch every month due to the data consumption they cause."
"6877",904209370,"I have had B612 for at least 3 years and I loved making music videos.  But then it got updated and now they only have one song on the music part and it gets really  annoying listening to the same song over and over again.

"6892",904737541,"It is an amazing Game"
"6893",904737541,"Very clever design, entertaining, great graphics. Most of the levels are challenging but fun. Unfortunately, they drop into the play-to-win model at the later stages, teeing up levels that are impossible to beat without spending cash. I‚Äôm ok with that for a free game, but for one that charges to download, they automatically lose two stars."
"6894",904737541,"Fun."
"6895",904737816,"My progress on my iPad won‚Äôt upload to my phone"
"6896",904737816,"Not only is it challenging, the game maintains it's same humor. The things the characters say are my favorite part of the game. Origins is definitely my favorite out of the series. Love that the game doesn‚Äôt nickel and dime you."
"6897",904737816,"This company can do no wrong!  This game is amongst the best ever done!"
"6898",905121703,"You stop maintaining the game, delete the Crazy Wheel and the gold mine but you can still collect money for add ons. Ridiculous    The least you could do is put the Crazy Wheel and gold mine back."
"6899",905121703,"I have been playing this game for a year now and am in level 16. For the second time now all of my balloons in all of the worlds are gone! The last time this happened it took quite a while, but then all of a sudden they were back. It just happened again and I‚Äôm thinking I should probably just delete this game, but like I said I do like it other than this issue. Has this happened to anyone else and if so what was your solution?"
"6900",905121703,"Game won‚Äôt update after world 21. Called customer service and they said it‚Äôs not them it‚Äôs the developer of the game. Sad sad. Been waiting for the update since December of 2018, don‚Äôt waste you time or money. Sad sad!"
"6901",905488045,"Here is a tip for noobs:  DON‚ÄôT DIE!!!!!!!   Whenever I lose, I go back to the start and loose everything I owned.  This game is so frustrating, and I don‚Äôt know how to get hearts. All the enemies and so hard and never die! If you haven‚Äôt bout this game yet, think about whether or not you are good at video games. If you are, go ahead and get it. If not, keep searching. I heard Swordigo is free."
"6902",905488045,"Such a fun game and a joy to get all the achievements. Will keep you engaged for hours. Wish they would expand it since it‚Äôs been a couple years. Definitely my favorite iPhone platformer"

"6904",905729701,"Thee only bad thing is that they ONLY let you run for so long."

I can tell but it‚Äôs got some problems                                                Pros Nice background (I just really like it)  I like sound affects  I like you have 2 attacks instead of one                                                Cons Some things have no collision  Running button should stay on until you tap it again or your energy runs out  You should make eating like in cat sim  No jump button  Needs more pack members  If you fix these things this could be a great game. Please fix and have a nice day!"
"6906",905729701,"Okay, I love your games! They are the best, and I know you take lots of time and effort to make them, but how about adding more? Every game is basically the same now....but you just play as a different animal and similar things. I think you should have some more unique and realistic features for your games. Maybe you could have it in the Ultimate Lion simulator where you could have up to 15 pride members, since real life lion prides usually have more than 6. And in some of your games you could add it to where your pride, pack, brood, etc members could challenge you, and you‚Äôll have to beat them if you want to keep control over your pride, pack, brood, etc. If not then you‚Äôll be kicked out and you‚Äôll basically have to start over (not level wise, but start over with getting a mate and den). It would also be cool if you had to actually protect your family members. In real life, I‚Äôm sure things would try to attack you. Like in the Ultimate Dragon simulator, you can add it to where a battalion of knights may invade your den and try to kill you and your brood, or maybe you could have thieves try and steal your gold. I also think you should have to protect your territory in some of your games (such as Ultimate Lion, Wolf, Bird, etc). It would be so much more realistic! I‚Äôve played quite and few of your games, and I‚Äôm very impressed, but I do see spots where you can make these games even better! I would really appreciate this if you have taken your time to read this and think about my suggestions. These are just ideas, so don‚Äôt feel pressured or anything!   ‚ÄîThank you!"

"6908",905852173,"Really can't elaborate more than that.  It's a fun game but the Apple TV version is buggy.  It gives a pop-up after Level 5 asking for a review (in poor grammar, at that). Worse, the pop-up covers the screen and there is no way to make it disappear...except perhaps by giving a review in the App Store.  Will find out soon enough, because that's the only reason I'm bothering to give this review.  Pester someone for a review and don't be surprised if you get 3 stars or less.  UPDATE: posted review here and STILL getting a pop-up asking for a review. Downgrading to two-stars"

"6930",907174449,"Bought this for my grandsons fifth birthday after he saw the add on tv.  He was very disappointed that the track advertised required an additional purchase after paying $6.99 for the game.  There are only a couple of tracks open for play.  All the others also require additional purchase. Shame on you Nickelodeon!  He really enjoyed what was open to him but finished it in a couple of hours."
"6931",907210971,"$3.99 only comes with 3 tracks and the others are behind a pay wall placed in front of the kids after they finish a game. 1.99 for each subsequent track. Find something else. At least make this version free if you are going to charge 1.99 to unlock additional tracks."
"6932",907210971,"My kids liked the app. They are 5 &2 and both enjoyed racing. But after paying $4 for and app you can only race on 3 tracks then you have to pay 1.99 each to race on the remaining 4 locked tracks. If I'm gonna pay $4 for an app I expect it to be free to use all of it."
"6933",907210971,"Bought this game for my 3 yo and every time I try opening it it crashes. I want my money back."

"6949",908073488,"The game blends lore and the mechanics perfectly while creating a want for progression each time you make a mistake and end up dying. Something that‚Äôs great to do for a short while and pick up later or get lost in for hours."
"6950",908073488,"Idk what happened but after about 15-20 minutes of play through, the game just crashes. When I open the game back up, it‚Äôs as if I haven‚Äôt played at all and resets my progress. Please fix?? Thank you!"

"6952",908384544,"Interesting story. Different types of puzzles. Great map to get you where you need to go. I would recommend. But, some items can't be selected by picking on team directly, you have to do an edge. But still worth playing the American."
"6953",908384544,"Got this game because I like hidden objects. This game has a lot of bugs on my iPad. A lot of the objects you find you have to press 3-4 times before it registered. One of the puzzles was a three part and it wouldn't switch over to the others. I even reset it and did over and still no luck. Had to hit hint to get it opened. I will finish this game but not very happy with it."
"6954",908384544,"This game was released May 2015 with a free trial then purchase. It had a great rating then so why don't you show it as a re-release. Good thing I checked my purchases. Not very honest Big Fish."

I haven‚Äôt had good luck with twin stick shooters with iPhone usually cause how small this iphone is and yes it does make it more difficult but this game is fantastic it‚Äôs a really well done rogue-lite-like twin stick shooter with gorgeous graphics, magic spells and grenades! what more can you ask for.

"7008",909730184,"First off, I've been playing this game for about an hour nonstop and it's amazing. I love dual-stick shooters and this is among the most beautiful, unique, and polished in all the App Store. I keep thinking Transistor (one of my favorites of all time) in a dual-stick shooter format. This game is so good, they could have asked for a lot more in terms of price; it's a steal. My only complaint (and I hope the devs are reading this) is that the camera is a bit too sensitive to every movement. When you've got to do a lot of dodging, it can be a bit jarring. I think it could be easily smoothed over in an update (it's certainly not a deal breaker nor does it take away from gameplay). Anyway, amazing job, Devs. Thank you for making this amazing game and thanks for bringing it to iOS!  Update: I still adore this amazing shooter but I‚Äôd love to see iPhone XR screen compatibility. Please!"

The graphics are really nice, and nicely animated, but the battles are short, the battlefields are small, and as much of the game consists of reading and making dialog choices as battling. The tactical depth of battle almost makes up for the small battlefield, and short battles...almost.    All in all, it‚Äôs not my cup of tea. I may, or may not finish the story, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt mess with the sequel unless it was on sale for a buck."
"7025",911006986,"This game is an amazing experience"
"7026",911006986,"I loved this game on Mac and now playing through it on hard difficulty on iOS. Unfortunately I encountered this gamebreaking bug: after the first fight in the first war, the gray screen appears with a clickable arrow to go on to the following fight. I spent a long time carefully orchestrating a good strategy that took a good anount of time to plan and play out, maybe 25 minutes. The arrow on the gray screen however wasn‚Äôt clickable and the game essentially was stuck; I tried anything I could think of like rotating the iPhone screen, tapping home button then coming back to the app, tapping and swiping anywhere...to no avail. When i hard exited the app from the OS and restarted it, as knew would happen, the war progress is gone and I need to start from the last auto save; very frustrating after a long, hard fight that had gone well and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to try it again after a while given it seems like it‚Äôll just hang again...  This game is a wonderful work of art and a great accomplishment in terms of game design, artwork, music, and I find it very unfortunate that a few polish issues got by the quality assurance that really interrupt the flow and immersion. I actually encountered this exact bug on the Mac Desktop version, but in that case alt tabbing out and back took care of it. I have a hard time believing this somehow never came up in testing and somehow wasn‚Äôt taken care of. I‚Äôm on iPhone 6 by the way.   My actual rating for this game is more like 4+ stars, but I am currently frustrated at the loss of progress, and it would certainly be 5 stars if bugs like didn‚Äôt appear, as well as some small improvements to the display that I wrote about in a rewiew of BS2: when displaying all armor / str flags in combat, surround enemy flags by a red outline to make them stand out from your own heroes more and make it easier to parse information; add a second buttton that when pressed shows numbers next to the enemy units on the battlefield representing their turn order: 1 for next, 2 for one after that etc. These small quality of life improvements to help display information and the player parse said information that is already available,more easily would make the game more of a pleasure to play, for me personally."

"7030",911115712,"I am really annoyed because I downloaded this for my daughter to watch Paw Patrol and other Nick Jr. episodes while we are traveling or out and about. However, only one episode is unlocked. The others are locked and say we need a subscription which we have Charter and can get Nick Jr on our Charter. I am not sure why they are locked. When I go to fix it, it says grownups need to put the code which I do and then it freezes on that screen. I am completely dissatisfied with this app."
"7031",911115712,"It worked for a while with my cable provider, for a few months it won‚Äôt even send me to a login screen or use my TV provider logged in on my device to access cable information. It just keeps asking if I am a subscriber (which I am). I have troubleshot everything and now I am just annoyed. At least Disney Jr and PBS still work just fine without all this headache."
"7032",911115712,"Nice app!   How soon will we be able to go back and see season 5 episode 1 after it airs.   Same day ?"
"7033",911130812,"Great app to find your shoes love this app"
"7034",911130812,"yeah this app is garbage after i won the raffle they charged me then say ‚Äúthank you for your order and sh*‚Äù then after a few days they said that my order was delayed and then the next day they cancel my order and say it‚Äôs out of stock..if theres a 0star i‚Äôll do it"
"7035",911130812,"App always crashes and never loads when there is a shock drop or quick enough for me to usually get anything good. I also never seem to ever have success on any of the drawings, nor do I get exclusive access on really anything. Just seems odd."
"7036",911156590,"Cool"
"7037",911156590,"I‚Äôve downloaded a few other drawing apps before and this one is the best free one! I should invest in a pen to draw with and I‚Äôve only been using my finger on my phone screen but I haven‚Äôt let that stop me from making super detailed characters. Thanks for such a great free app! My only complaint is I can only zoom out of the largest sized paper so far and it doesn‚Äôt allow me to draw anything too large, I‚Äôve only been able to draw a character full body a couple of times and I couldn‚Äôt get as much detail as I would like, but, no major complaints at all since it‚Äôs free, I only have it on my phone and I don‚Äôt have a stylus lol, so that much is really a personal preference, as well as wanting more texture tools to draw with, but again, it‚Äôs free (I think?) so I‚Äôm content."
"7038",911156590,"It‚Äôs a bit slow I don‚Äôt know how to get the layer off when I‚Äôm drawing otherwise it‚Äôs pretty great!!!"
"7039",911201894,"You buy the game. You play it. No servers, no log-ins, no in-app purchases, no excessive layers of currencies and pay-to-win mechanics. I had nearly forgotten phone games could be this straightforward. I bought this on a whim after the release of ‚ÄúHero‚Äù in Smash Bros. reminded me of the original game (which was called ‚ÄúDragon Warrior‚Äù in the U.S., in case anyone is looking for that game). Very happy with the purchase.  The game itself is very old school. You‚Äôll be doing a lot of grinding, but the touch screen menus make that more tolerable and it‚Äôs a decent enough way to pass the time. Most phone games force you into grinding anyway, but suggest you pay money to skip it. In this one you‚Äôll just have to slash away at slimes until you level up to take on better enemies like the old days. The overworld controls are a little goofy, like all phone d-pads, but they get the job done and finesse is not needed in this kind of game. I like the vertical orientation; it makes it easier to switch in and out of the app to do stuff on your phone without having to turn the whole phone.  The updated graphics and music give the game a cool SNES vibe. I‚Äôd love the option to use the original graphics/music/screen resolution, but I can see how that might be infeasible given the phone layout. In any case, love has clearly been given to this port, and if you like ‚Äò80s JRPGs, this is well worth your $3. I‚Äôll probably play through the series and see if I can convince myself to check out DQ11 for Switch eventually."
"7040",911201894,"First time playing through these classic dragon quest games and thanks to the mobile ports they are easy to grab and go. play for 15mins and stop, go do what ever and come back and pick up right where you left off. The port is self is pretty good to me at least being able to customize the controls location and only once during my play through did i freeze, but because of auto save the game froze or crashed, I closed the game and start up right before that event happened truly a great port."
"7041",911201894,"I‚Äôve never played the DQ series before nor did I want to. Yet after the release of ‚ÄúThe Hero‚Äù in SSBU (smash) I couldn‚Äôt hide the fact that the music and game interested me. I‚Äôve never played the NES version or the other remakes besides this one on IOS. I got to say that this is a game I‚Äôve been missing. It was classic RPG in its finest. I used a YouTube video title ‚Äúhow to beat DQ in 5 mins‚Äù and I don‚Äôt regret it either. I enjoyed my experience so much I became a fan. This is my first time playing the game and I got to say that it is a 5/5. I told my wife that I think I would love DQ more then FF if I played it first. The price is beautiful too. Can‚Äôt beat it. I hope you liked my first review. I‚Äôm on a mission to clear every DQ game on IOS. Check me on the other games review too. Keep track of me. I‚Äôm here.  #firstreview"

And to answer all questions at once, the features and layout of MarcoPolo are centered around easy, fun communication via videos. No other app does it quite as well.

"7084",913943275,"The hifi files on Tidal are noticeably better than the crap on Spotify and I sprang for a subscription as soon as I heard one. Although the catalog is a bit more limited, it contains almost anything if you know how to look. But that‚Äôs not easy, especially if you‚Äôre interested in anything outside of mainstream pop. Like maybe classical. Do a search for Felix Mendelssohn, for example, and it returns about two dozen albums of the ‚Äúclassical moods‚Äù variety, stuff by b-list performers. But search for the Emerson Quartet, and you will find their recording of Mendelssohn‚Äôs octet, and others. You have to search by performer. If you want to compare recordings of a particular composition, you have to make a list of them from some other source. Like maybe Spotify. This really limits Tidal‚Äôs usefulness as a music discovery tool, and although I really like the service, I can‚Äôt give it a higher rating than 3."
"7085",913943275,"Review of Tidal Hifi. This sound quality is great. Not only are you getting lossless audio, you also get proper dynamic range (0-100Db)! This has taken me by surprise. For example, a song suddenly exploded after sounding a little soft. That's how music was mean't to be heard. Even if you choose ""high"" instead of ""HiFi"", you still get the same dynamic range.  One thing I would like is Siri support. This way, I can ask Siri to play a song and she'll play it on Tidal."

"7107",914673497,"This game is fun, but there are quite a few errors. First, the white fire is glitched so you can‚Äôt buy it, the rest of the family is like on top of each other and are literally inside each other, and the enemies glitch so you have difficulty killing them. The next issue is that once you kill all of the bosses and unlock everything, there is really nothing left to do. I‚Äôd love for the map to be much bigger, so it‚Äôll take much longer to explore. What would also be nice is that there are more abilities for the dragons, more colors, armor, and fire colors. It would also be wonderful is being able to be whichever dragon in your family you want.

"7114",915071248,"I never write reviews but I love this game and I haven‚Äôt even played it for long! One problem with it tho is that sometimes the marine life floats in mid air and attacks you but you can‚Äôt get it back. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this game!"

"7116",915071248,"Alushia was a beautiful silver dolphin with white swirls on her, but unlike other dolphins she had colorless eyes they were instead a beautiful silver. She did not have a pod she was abandoned. She was a resourceful strong smart and independent girl herself she could live with out a pod or mate. Not that she was ever given the chance. She was young when she had been abandoned but it had been years and she had grown she become a long slim beautiful dolphin. She was swimming along looking for some dinner when she saw a big shadow... then suddenly she was snatched up! She did not even have the split second she needed to fight or flee or do something! So she waited and thought up a plan or something. Soon she was thrown out of the attacker‚Äôs grasp and into a cage. She swam around with her long slim tail keeping her afloat. Then she heard something in the back of the cage like a clutter of some sort collapsed on the ground then under a pile of trinkets she saw a male about her age he was a spotted dolphin and has large pale blue eyes almost colorless like her own.. not bad looking either but who cares she was trapped in a cage with a klutz and a king crab who thought who could go around sacking dolphins. The dolphin male finally saw her and held his gaze for a little too long.. well buddy boy looks like we‚Äôre in the deep end of the ocean now she said to him in a sarcastic tone. Oh.. umm yes I suppose so I must now regain my soul from looking at the.. wall for some minutes miss he said unsure of himself but sure that his life choices in his life had not gone right but now it was good. Alushia interpreted this from his unsteady facial expression and endless staring at her. Look this is getting annoying with your staring so snap out of it! Although she was annoyed she secretly thought his clueless face and klutz moves were adorable was a shame she was trapped in a cage. I as the narrator think they would be adorable! Anyway... THE CRAB KING WILL SEE YOU NOW! Said a large Orca... yeah well the king crab can try but he ain‚Äôt getting his grubby pinched on me WHAT OF THE EVERS CHILD DOLPHIN! Can you English today mister orca? ENGLISH OF THE YES? (Btw that was not meant to offend anyone at all and I sincerely apologize if it did) they were pushed into the throne rooms and heard a large booming voice coming from a large crab.. OH I SEE I HAVE TWO DOLPHIN THIS BOY HAS BEEN HERE A WHILE HE IS USELESS NO SKILLS AT ALL! BUT CLEARLY DOLPHIN FEMALES ARE THE GOODIES YOU KNOW THEY CAN DO ANYTHING AS I HAVE SEEN FROM WATCHING YOU MISS ALUSHIA! EVEN MAGIC! magic what in the blubbers name are you talking about? HAHA SIMPLETON IS IT YOU WHO CAN WHISPER TO THE WAVES? Umm more like is it you that needs some serious help with your little brain? HAHA YOU ARE FUNNNY! YOU ARE THE OCEAN WEAVER OF THIS DAY AND AGE! The ocean weaver is just a little fish tale.. it‚Äôs just the one animal in the sea that controls the sea and friends to the ocean right? IT IS MY CHILD AND IT IS YOU I HAVE SEEN IF YOU DO NOT SEE TRY IT RIGHT NOW! Umm whatever you old hag of a crab... oceans and sea can you hear me I am the weaver of waves can you see make a wave make a splash as soon as I say all seas smash! Then the ocean went silent no sound came and then she said ALL SEAS SMASH! And a huge wave came and splashed down into the ocean. Sh3 went silent.. I‚Äôm I‚Äôm the the.... YES MY CHILD YOU ARE THE OCEAN WEAVER AND YOU WILL GIVE ME THE HEART OF THE SEA!"

I think you should make an Ultimate Snake Simulator! You could have different types of snakes, different types of venom that would do different things, differnt types of hypnotizing that would make the other animals do different stuff, it could be cool!

"7123",915223450,"I waited years for a Japanese handwriting input app this functional. Recognizes English handwriting pretty well too."
"7124",915223450,"This app is very good at what it does, but it presents a bug when used with the Apple Watch. If your watch is in one language (such as English) and you try to dictate a message in another language (such as Japanese) on your watch, the watch incorrectly interprets your speech in English. This happens despite the fact that the last message you wrote using this app to the same contact on your iPhone was in Japanese.  Normally, the watch interprets speech in the language of the last used keyboard for a specific contact in Apple's Message app. Therefore, in order to get the Apple Watch to interpret your speech in the correct language again, you must go back to your iPhone and select the standard Apple keyboard for the contact in the Message app. This is very inconvenient.  This is the only reason I rate this app with only three stars. If you don't have an Apple Watch, then this app is great."
"7125",915223450,"Good: handles a large character set and the recognition is good. Bad: there is no way to select a character that is not in the list it shows. There is no way to fix incorrect character segmentation. The return key does not register in Javascript web apps."

"7132",915545000,"The kids noticed that the little monster icon had changed right away!  They loved the Halloween themed fun.

Thanks so much for the clever changes,"
"7133",915545000,"My kids love the new Halloween update. So much more to do now ‚ò∫Ô∏è They love how drinking the different potions does different things to the monster (do this by holding it up to the monsters mouth for a few seconds until you see the potion bottle flip upside down.

"7138",915861546,"The only way I scrapbook anymore:)! Great app!!"
"7139",915861546,"(See update below) The app hooks you in by promoting monthly kits and the entire Project Life schtick is to keep current on your scrapping. Great, I‚Äôm behind that 100%. Happy to pay something every month for a monthly kit to use; I‚Äôd even be happy to pay for a year‚Äôs worth of kits in advance. Only problem .... kits are several weeks to a month late. Makes it hard to stay in the moment. However, the developers seem happy to charge an exorbitant amount for cloud storage, many times iCloud or Dropbox rates ... that makes me wonder about where their priorities are.  Update (downgrade): monthly delays are killing this app. I realize that Becky Higgins has gone through professional and personal changes lately but the users have paid money based on what the business owners promised. Trying to be sympathetic but based on her Instagram, she‚Äôs spending her time/energy on other things. If she‚Äôs going to abandon supporting the app, I wish she‚Äôd tell us."
"7140",915861546,"I love love love this app. It is my favorite way to make quick scrapbook pages. HOWEVER, the quality of the soft cover book is severely lacking. The glued binding didn‚Äôt last a day. I have several years worth of albums to print but I am little nervous about wasting my money. I may try to the hardcover next time and hope for the best."

"7142",916130071,"Look it is wayyyyyyy to hard to get all the characters together,the first time I played it was easy,the parents didn‚Äôt come back to pick up their children as fast and I got all the babies to the pool,but I played it a seconds time and...well I was missing one character,the dog,so I waited for him to be dropped off,but another parent came, the pig ,to pick up their child,so I got out of the station and then went back,and I hoped for it to be the dog and his dad/mom, BUT THE FRIKIN PIG CAME BACK!!!!! So I tried again and again AND AGAIN, but the pig CAME BaCk! And I just quit to write this review soooooooo... fix that please,and also I want more locations for the characters to visit like maybe more of the beach the pirate ship is on or something else but I would like to have more places to explore with the characters. But I have to say I am older than three to four years old and I still enjoy the game so kudos to you dr. Panda for keeping me entertained with your games for years,thank you for reading,bye for now."
"7143",916130071,"It‚Äôs actually kinda fun but it could have been a little better if u added more areas in the water park because I actually get kinda bored when just playing in the same areas as always"
"7144",916215494,"Now it‚Äôs a joke.. very shady practice from this/these app developers."
"7145",916215494,"since I can't give it 2.5 stars I'm going with 2.  If I could simply make collections with my favorite Spotify and Soundcloud tracks, that alone would give this app at least 4 stars. Maybe 5, after I've spent enough time with the app to know what rating it deserves. As of now, I can't access anything from Spotify accept for empty playlists. Nothing has synced. I don't know how long it's supposed to take. If it finally does sync my library, I'll change my rating.  At current, I can only give it 2 stars and a monthly subscription isn't even a consideration."
"7146",916215494,"i regret updating this app , why you have to ruin such perfect app"
"7147",916281743,"I found this game preloaded on a phone I bought years ago. I like the game so much I downloaded it onto every new phone I‚Äôve bought. Then last month it started crashing regularly. They updated it within the last week and now I am constantly bombarded with adds that are not immediately skip-able. It just ruins the game. Time to find a new game."
"7148",916281743,"Is anyone having trouble with this game I‚Äôm on 270 and it freezes up on me I have to stop until the next day?????? Please fix this game it is still freezing up after you play 3 games"

After the update I haven‚Äôt been able to endure the white back drop at night. I‚Äôve looked for night mode options on the preferences and see none. Have also looked online for it, no success. It‚Äôs so painful staring at the white contrasting backdrop. Is there really no option for it? That‚Äôs my one major issue, I miss the dark interface. Would gladly recommend the app but please help in that regard. It‚Äôs an awful thing to be stuck with, ruins the experience. Thanks for everything else. It‚Äôs an incredible app in every other way, a mixed media artist‚Äôs dream come true. üíó"

"7154",916540089,"Franz‚Äôs apps are astounding and stunning in every way! I adore Sunny. I‚Äôve never heard anything that actually put me right at the ocean. Put on your headphones or earbuds and you will believe you‚Äôre there! I‚Äôve been struggling with stress and anxiety, and have been trying multiple apps to help. I‚Äôve found my port! When I started listening to Franz‚Äôs apps with the real, full-bodied sounds of nature, the most beautiful music, and looking at the gorgeous, vintage-feeling artwork it took my breath away and my eyes actually welled up as I was instantly filled with peace and calm because it was so beautiful and real!   Thanks to Sunny, I feel as though I‚Äôm actually lazily, lying beachside listening to the waves roll in and out.  Franz, you ARE amazing! Thank you! üôèüèΩ"
"7155",916540089,"One thing I really like about this app is that it allows me to time my sessions. And if I get a phone call in the middle of the session, I can look and see how much time has elapsed so that I can finish my session. None of the other apps will keep track of how much time you have spent for the day. I only use the timer daily count for one day not over the course of a long period of time. I think you have to buy the app for that."
"7156",916585802,"This game is so good just from looking at the title I need it was good I love it so much and have always been a big fan"
"7157",916585802,"Honestly a great game. I also love your channel and hope you can make more games like this one"
"7158",916585802,"I beat the game and it was one of the best wizard app games I played"
"7159",916728593,"They keep releasing updates that have really made effort feel less impactful. And the last update broke the app. It won‚Äôt even load. Find something else"
"7160",916728593,"Over the years, I played Stormfall, Rise of Balur with few accounts. Plarium has updates quite often with too many bugs. Average once a month. Some updates cause more problems than before, and every major updates add new revenue schemes. Worst part of Stormfall is bad connections and request to relogin. Stormfall requires latest hardware with high powered CPU, much memory, and high bandwidth connection. My new iPad 128mb wasn‚Äôt good enough for last update. I had to relogin after almost every click. Frustration is an understatement.  This is after a new owner and multiple major upgrades. Developer wants detailed failure data but it doesn‚Äôt change much afterwards. Even top tier coiners who spend hundreds of dollars per month (thousands in some months)doesn‚Äôt always get best customer service either.  Another unfair thing about Stormfall is there are lots of Russian federation players who can buy game currency at less than 1/10th of EU or US players. They can buy more troops for cheaps and kill your league easier.  Why do I still play? Many good players left but few players I have developed relationships with are good. Otherwise I would have quit too. When my game mates are gone then I‚Äôll be gone too."
"7161",916728593,"This game has become exclusively about who is willing to pour money into the game versus the game used to be about work and reward as well as team comradery. The Tower feature is an unnecessary addition and really is not enjoyed by those who play the game. Once again it rolls back to money-anyone who buys their way in/out and around advancement glitches within the game is a happy camper. They are always the strongest and capable of rushing 70-80% of their fellow players. The face that they receive VIP status for both playing/spending just reinforces that the game developers are more worried about financial gain than member retention. I really wish everything in this game -as far as ranking /needs/ and building strength did not revolve around paying for 3/4 of it. At this point over 1/2 of 20 leagues I played with have already abandoned their castles and quit playing all together. For the average person looking for a way to relax and enjoy a game -I wouldn‚Äôt recommend SF, but if you are above average economically with a competitive trait and have money to burn-then I would recommend this game. The spenders seem to love it!"
"7162",916741290,"Elegant and easy to use interface, but it lacks important attributes. The best way I can describe it is: simplicity at the expense of key features.   I would suggest the following:  1. Incorporate Face ID. Currently, it feels as though my financial information is exposed.   2. Make the widget customizable and interactive. Currently, the widget feels like a shortcut to the app. It shows information I don‚Äôt need or want to display while my phone is locked. Also, the widget should be interactive in a way that users can enter new transactions directly from the widget.   3. Remove the constant request to subscribe to your newsletter every single time a budget is created. Leave it in the settings as an option or a one time pop up when the app is first installed. Currently it feels very forced.  I absolutely love how beautiful and easy to understand this app is.  Thank you for the opportunity to use your app and provide feedback."
"7163",916741290,"The app is slick and looks great. It‚Äôs easy to use and only gets easier the more you use it.   The only gripe I have with it is how finicky and hard it is to swipe on the main screen. Swiping right or left both have the function of switching through your budgets, or if you start your swipe closer to the edge of the phone it‚Äôll go to all your budgets or your expenses. It‚Äôs a little hard to operate.  Other than that, it‚Äôs really clean and simple. One thing to note is that it does not link to you bank account and automatically track your expenses. However, I prefer this more because automated expense tracking often messes up or categorizes incorrectly. That‚Äôs just something to keep in mind."

It‚Äôs on, it‚Äôs off, and my finger on the button has little to do with the result. I spent an hour one day trying to get her in place, then closed the game in disgust. Next time I reopened, the ballerina went to her place within minutes, and I had nothing to do with it. Frustrating. If not for all the other notes I‚Äôd think it a glitch. As is, I don‚Äôt know what to think.  But buy then all, anyway. They‚Äôre perfectly splendid games.

We gather the information to help us make a decision when we add a new or change our current provider. If your bank is voted for, we will definitely consider that."
"7204",918780702,"July 4th update was bad but the newest update is just the same, if not WORSE. The balls get stuck in the portals no matter how many you shoot inside of them, each emotions power, when activated glitches and doesn‚Äôt actually work. Currently just unlocked fear at level 203 and his power literally falls right off the screen and the orb is wasted. I‚Äôve played this game for over a year and it‚Äôs the worst it‚Äôs ever been, so sad. The new update makes this game nearly impossible to play now. Successfully at least."
"7205",918780702,"This is a very fun game for many ages. I got through 18 levels in a day because I love this game sooooo much. If you are looking for a fun,interactive, addictive game to play get this one!üòÄ"
"7206",918780702,"I used to be on a super high level. But I stopped playing. I recently started again at level 1.... I‚Äôm now where Fear is.

I will stop spending my $ on this game and delete it soon if it‚Äôs not fixed ASAP."

"7211",918902604,"My friends and I love playing this game, but there should be a mode where you can play with more than 2 players. You might even have a sort of free-for-all where your ship can travel to the other person‚Äôs screen and you can move and fight from there while you control from your device. It would be EPIC. Maybe even an online multiplayer version where you can fight with others around the world and have a customized ship. (Kind of like agar.io, but you try to get kills‚Äînot eat others) And then have a campaign sort of version where you fly through levels and maybe obstacles and then have enemy ships that aren‚Äôt just the three types in ‚Äúdefend‚Äù: circle, triangle, square. Have like boss levels in the campaign. That would be super epic and would make this game even more popular. DO IT."

"7215",918997182,"It could be better if the encounters occurred less often. I didn‚Äôt even make it to the other side of 50 acre woods, the encounters were so often and I kept getting lost. So 99cents spent and not worth it."

"7225",919097064,"So I wanted this game for a long time. Every time we‚Äôd go to Olive Garden I used to grab the little iPad thing and play Toca Boo the whole time. But when my little sister came along, when we went to Olive Garden so took the iPad thing out of my hands. I just looked at my mom with a mad face and she would just say ‚Äú it‚Äôs okay she is little, do you want her to scream over a little game? Here, we can get it on your iPad so you can play it everywhere.‚Äù I say ‚Äúokay mommy‚Äù then I just glanced at my sister playing that game. But when I finally got it, I was occupied for one day, then I got a little bored of it. But in my sisters opinion she loves the thing to death! She plays it nonstop! But in my opinion I think the Toca Life games are better but that‚Äôs my opinion.... OH WAIT!!!!! I have an other opinion too! I would recommend this game for younger players not like a 9-12 year old. I think the kids who love it the most is 3-6 but again that‚Äôs my opinion. YOU DO YOU!!!! ;) thank you for reading my very very long review!"

"7233",919478091,"Most manga introduced in the US is A+ rank in Japan, but we have really wide range of selections. Some may be B class for the niche market, like gamble enthusiasts to specific sports fans, sexy stories, or forgotten gems never made it to the mass market, which is rarely introduced in the US. But that doesn't mean they are bad. They just targeted very specific readers or missed the time .

I wish they would go back and have the Halloween event and make the game more active with different events for the holidays.  I love the game and have been playing for several years now.  They really need to upgrade the max level in the game which is now level 60.   Update: 8-1-17.  I was so happy today to find an update for more maps.  Thank You!!!! Several months ago I asked one of the staff on Facebook if they were going to do any more updates for this game and a few days later I got a message back in bad English that there would be no more updates.  I'm glad you listened to all my e-mails.  I love this game and please keep the updates coming.   Update: 11-8-16. The last update was great as they dropped the prices down on the repairs.   The game is fun to play and it's fast paced. The game gives you a lot of chances to open up chests.  I would stay to the chests that you have keys for other wise you will be spending a lot of money on diamonds.    I under stand the game developer want to make money but geez don't Robb the customers.   I do like the game and the challenge but will be careful on wasting to much money on diamonds. I do believe in supporting games I play and will spend some real money."

If the publisher decided to add/omit/ or change a word or sentence, guess what? Yes, we were expected to purchase the new book(s)!  Selling your books back to the book store was a complete JOKE!  I was told, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll give you $100 for everything.  I had also purchased (separately), the Anatomy Coloring Book, which was an excellent relaxant, and helpful memorization tool, and an advanced set of A&P flash cards). $100 dollars? Really Barnes & Noble? Disgusting!  I still have everything from my start to finish of school!  I wish that I had had this amazing A&P app when I was at school, and started memorizing the entire human body‚Äôs anatomical features and their physiological importance to our very existence.

"7247",921022358,"Unless youve got a lot of free cash floating around, forget it. Double drops...forget it, they adjust it so you get the same as a normal drop day(50% less drop rate on a double drop day is still regular). They also take away places to farm stuff and completely do things that they post and say they wont do, an absolute load of l*es.(they constantly say one thing then do the other.) I dont mind a little bit of spending but good grief these devs are just absolutely dragging the whales and crackins through the mud while choking out the free to play or lower spenders..even the whales are complaining about having to face whales 24/7...this game will go the way of star wars force collection, right into the apple dumpster bin in 18 months. Changed the game from 8‚Äùattempts ‚Äú to 5, lovely now shards rarely drop..it really seems like the dial down the drop rates on fresh characters as well, until their not really needed. One credit heist per month now, ridiculous! Only one day on the events bc we are progressing ‚Äútoo fast‚Äù ridiculous! Took away two zeta drop and gave a gauranteed one, ok but the two dropped maybe once a month so why take it away?!  Hint to the devs..you still need f2p for the whales to beat up on, if i was a whale and i was only facing other whales..id be more likely to quit now. They say players are progressing too fast so then they change and restrict how fast you can get stuff so you have to spend more. Former head developer even said she expects you to spend $1,000.00 a month to stay conpetitive(see what i did there), pfffffff. Now the game lags a lot after these relics(which are op af, but i like them). Still playing for now, but not giving up a dime for this garbage. Hey devs, every time you try to force a player to spend youve made less money that month, if you let us decide then youd probably get further witj that..if only this community were as big as the battlefront loot box fiasco community we could actually get them to listen. If you like throwing money into the toilet with a constant dopamine crash cuz youll have to spend to get ahead again the next day, then this is the game for you, step right up!

"7259",921902664,"Like many of you, I first heard about FELT on Shark Tank. Immediately I thought of a family member living overseas. I thought of her because she frequently sent all kinds of cards while living in the US. I was sure she would continue to send cards, just not as often because of unpredictable mailing times and the added expense. For over a year I have made a gift to her account. Each month she sends various cards to family and friends in the US. I especially like the ones with pictures of her children.

Sofia Howard‚ù§Ô∏è"
"7269",922199867,"So I found two horses and then I got a colt. One horse was black and white, the other one was a buckskin paint and my baby was a buckskin. When I came back to play the next day they were all the same color as me, a bay. I was like What the heck!! PLEASE FIX!!!"
"7270",922281347,"It was very good .I play it whenever I can . But I wish I could climb a tree and I can't find any fish.Where are they?!?"
"7271",922281347,"Why won‚Äôt you make more games Pleaseüò•üò•"
"7272",922281347,"Please fix the fox simulator"
"7273",922380267,"As an old school Sierra gamer in the 80‚Äôs, this game was a fantastic experience.  It is a quality story with that good quality feel of the  original sci-fi of the 20th century.  The touch control is intuitive and simple to use as well."
"7274",922380267,"This has a great story line totally worth the buck I spent on it"
"7275",922380267,"Reminiscent of Earthbound in the good ways. Excellent music, story, and gameplay. It took me a few times of playing to get used to the mechanics but I don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way. It was different and enjoyable. A favorite, and not just on this platform."
"7276",922488002,"Have played this game for many years and pretty much start every morning with the Daily Puzzle. I recently had a problem with the app. but Customer Service were brilliant and helped me get me back in the game. I hope they keep adding levels, cause I‚Äôm going to keep playing."
"7277",922488002,"I‚Äôve been playing Word Bubbles for over two years. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become fully addicted to a game on my phone at age 64. I had completed more than 2000 levels and I was in the Indian Ocean. I was distraught when one day I opened the game to discover I was back at level one. After many frets, I contacted the support team. They went above and beyond to restore my progress. Love this game and can‚Äôt thank them enough for the support."
"7278",922488002,"Love this...."

"7287",923268741,"UPDATE THE GAME"
"7288",923441570,"Make it free access no paying"
"7289",923441570,"Cost to much money"
"7290",923441570,"This the stupidest game I ever heard it always come out on slither.io this game is stupid"
"7291",923555295,"The game plays fine except the voices or volume goes out and I can‚Äôt hear the game until I close out the game and restart then I can hear the voices for about ten seconds then it goes out again so the only way I can tell what going on is through the caption I‚Äôm thinking guess what the caption doesn‚Äôt work either the game is really alive when the voice acting is working but now I cannot understand what is going on in the game so it‚Äôs not playable if it can get fixed with an update it would be great all my other games on my iPad work and I can hear them so what‚Äôs up with this one maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have brought the bundle if I cannot play it I want a refund"
"7292",923555295,"They really need a 2nd one to continue the story because the storyline is amazing along with the gameplay."
"7293",923555295,"Sound cuts out"
"7294",923760656,"Well, Lost is my favorite tv show of all time, and this game is basically Lost + zombies. I can't believe how cheap it is. I throw so much money at these BS games that just kill time -- I would be willing to spend a decent amount of money on an expansion or console version (although it‚Äôd essentially be Dead Island - I just really love this game.)   I was starting to think this game was getting repetitive until I prematurely tried to disarm the center island tesla, then I realized I should just go work on the third (NE in my case) island first. And HOLY MOLY the third island was like a whole new game entirely. So many more bases, a hidden little oasis through a tunnel of trees, with actual decorations in the houses that you can take. Crazy amounts of zombies, but crystal transformers at every transit location.   I love this game and cannot believe it isn't more popular.   Anyways -- the few cons I've noticed (that don't make the game unplayable at all) :   Zombies get stuck in walls, a lot of the dig sites don't work, sometimes auto aim doesn't seem to work but I suppose that could be user error, there could be different enemies or some more change of scenery.   Anyways -- spend the three dollars and try it out. It's a hidden gem of the App Store. I‚Äôd legit pay a good $30-40 or so on a PS4 version."
"7295",923760656,"Honestly not worth the cost. Buggy"
"7296",923760656,"I played this game for a long time and placed down a cabinet and my game crashed.  So I load back in my inventory and my house was gone. Everything I had disappeared in one second."
"7297",923772792,"5 star game and 5 star adaptation of the physical game - absolutely LOVE the weekly challenges and all the DLC. *EXCEPT* lately I can‚Äôt make it through a whole game without the app crashing half a dozen times. Once the crashing is fixed, 5 stars from me."
"7298",923772792,"Absolutely fantastic. With all the variables brought on by different heroes, villains, and environments, the amount of unique combinations of play styles is colossal.  There are a few things that could be better, however. The app does occasionally crash, and though it always saves your progress, it‚Äôs still pretty annoying when it happens.  I would also like it if I could somehow save which expansions I‚Äôve already purchased online so that I won‚Äôt have to buy them all over again if I ever switch to the Steam version."
"7299",923772792,"SotM is a superb translation of the card game, replicating the physical game experience near perfectly. The artwork is amazing. This app replaces the physical game for me in all ways. So why do I give it one star?  The game crashes more than a bind person going the wrong way on the interstate. Sure, it‚Äôs annoying, but as a person who has bought both Season 1 and 2 with all expansions, I should expect a game that‚Äôs stable. So long as this game crashes minimally 4 times per game, it can only get one star till it‚Äôs stability is fixed."
"7300",923814895,"Very fun game to play"
"7301",923814895,"Best single player three kingdoms game I have ever played on phone"
"7302",923814895,"Interesting game and cute hero"
"7303",923873989,"don‚Äôt waste your money on this. the app doesn‚Äôt save your videos."
"7304",923873989,"Doesn‚Äôt save to ur phone anymore"
"7305",923873989,"The app was working great for a couple first months then it stopped working. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to save photos or videos which make the whole thing useless!! I tried to update it; delete the app then redownload, turning my phone off then on again, update everything, still doesn‚Äôt work, even on the free version!! Wth man we pay to use the app please make it work again or please refund the money :/"
"7306",923917775,"I've been playing it for about 10 minutes and it's definitely a fun and cute game definitely worth the FREE download."
"7307",923917775,"This game is so fun and I really want to try and complete it!"
"7308",923917775,"This game honestly keeps me sane! All these cute kitties!!!"
"7309",923920872,"The app does not count steps right. It does not calculate rewards right. It often just wipes your steps taken in rewards calculation, tells you you don't have enough steps, or just tells you you already claimed the reward even though haven't. The app is a piece of junk."

"7314",924058967,"Super cute and scary fun for my little one! My six-year old loved the pumpkin toss and the Halloween - er - Nightmare Night theme where all of her favorite ponies were dressed up in costumes. When Luna hugged Fluttershy, my daughter laughed out loud at Fluttershy‚Äôs face. Nice to see some new characters too - Zecora and Luna. Another winner!"

"7318",924438909,"On my iPhone 6 the JPEG in settings is grayed out so will not shoot RAW. F stop is also locked at f2.2. Useless app for iPhone 6!"
"7319",924438909,"Strange bug still exists in latest build which - upon opening the app - raises the iPhone volume control when iPhone has volume level set to its lowest level (muted speakers). This has been present through the last several builds, including this latest one. Please fix this irritating bug."
"7320",924438909,"I‚Äôve been using ProShot for just about everything but panos - and with the Xr, portraits - for several years now - having tried many many other camera apps. The UI/UX is simple and gets out of the way when I don‚Äôt want it, but I can opt for a lot of control when I want it.   I also have to say the developer has been open to feedback and some of the changes in v5.5 are a direct result of comments I made. Can‚Äôt ask for a whole lot more than that!"
"7321",924443754,"Really easy to use, nice lay out, fun to search for lots and lots of products. All around great app!"
"7322",924443754,"I can not figure out how to view my pinned shops. The mobile website is much easier to browser and navigate."
"7323",924443754,NA
"7324",924491991,"Recently got an update and playlists can‚Äôt be viewed. Also certain iCloud songs are missing. This is a common problem (stuff breaking) with this app. Worth 2 bucks I guess, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs better ones out there though.  -UPDATE- I just opened this app after over a year of not using it. Doesn‚Äôt seem buggy at all. I‚Äôm starting to use it again as my primary music player. Still a better graphical experience than the Music app"
"7325",924491991,"Cs Music player is fantastic. It's everything I want from a music player; gesture controls, big glorious album art to show off on now playing, customizable color themes, and more. Truly a step up from Apple's native music app, however there are just a features I prefer from Apple Music; a dedicated section for recently added items, grid view while browsing albums and the ability to view/manage your up next queue. If some of these could be implemented into a future version this app would be perfect! Please and thanks!"
"7326",924491991,"I love the Cesium app for its user interface, and the fact that you can customize it.  I also love the ability to change the star ratings of the current song.  However, when I open the app (after manually closing it) the Now Playing GUI doesn‚Äôt open. I would like it to open with the song and playlist that was open when I closed the app. And yes, I have it set to open automatically in the app settings. But it doesn‚Äôt happen."
"7327",924589795,"I played a lot of MMO(RPG)s, Habbo, Runescape, etc., but phew.. Those kids post some crazy things on their timelines. Borderline nudity if you ask me lol. This game needs to be 18+."

"7330",924620788,"I love this app because as a student I‚Äôm able to access this app easier than signing into my school google account. This is way more convenient!"

"7335",924635678,"great app really love it"
"7336",924695435,"The only reason I gave it two stars is that it looks pretty.  What happened to all the tools.  One GLARING absence is THER IS NO LASSO.  What the frak?  I wasted money on this and it is basically useless to me.  Most of the tools won‚Äôt work, either.  What has happened to these apps?  They want to make everything so preset that a professional artist is allowed a basically dumbed down program for the selfies generation."
"7337",924695435,"Doesn‚Äôt warp, skew, or alter a layer‚Äôs perspective. I bought this because I love the desktop app and thought this would do it too. I‚Äôm now $5 poorer and have to spend another $2 on a separate app that does this very simple, common thing."
"7338",924695435,"Dude, this app does a lot of really cool things that I need and I appreciate it for that but the user interface truly makes me want to scream."
"7339",924826403,"It's very clear this game was designed around a touch screen, rather than fight the medium this game embraces it. Combined with the beautiful art and elegant story it makes the game a real masterpiece."
"7340",924826403,"The art and music are beautiful and the gameplay is solid. Top notch"
"7341",924826403,"Sometimes a slash just doesn't break a sword and its really frustrating when slashes high or low on the screen bring up your iPhone menus."
"7342",925056174,"Best app I‚Äôve found for local current conditions, and especially imminent precipitation or incoming severe weather."
"7343",925056174,"I got this one to use with my Garman watch And after numerous attempts I still cannot get it to work otherwise OK"
"7344",925056174,"So the app is wondee-& it can also predict the weather but can I get a little sunshine please. It‚Äôs been raining for weeks on end."
"7345",925201227,"But when i watch a video the game crashes please fix but this is the BEST app ever"

"7348",925338276,"This is the most ridiculously developed app I have ever used. I do all my banking on line and pay all my credit cards with apps and it‚Äôs usually extremely easy. This app just doesn‚Äôt even work."
"7349",925338276,"Like this store"
"7350",925338276,"Odioooo! Que no tengan autopay como en otras tiendas, parece que lo hacen mas complicado para que uno falle sus pagos, cuando todas las tiendas ya cuentan con ese servicio, los cupones son dif√≠ciles de usar en el app! Y sus cobros por env√≠os son exagerados, ya ni porque uno es platinum. Necesitan tener mejor servicio al cliente online!!!!"
"7351",925494667,"I love Flipline Studios games I play them on Cool Math all the time.The problem I‚Äôm having is the quality.I believe HD is way better then the to go,because it doesn‚Äôt say what is true.I even wasted 16 bucks on all the games to get my dad to buy all the games for me.The reason why I didn‚Äôt get HD was because of all the money it would coast me.Also Flipline studios should come out with a vegetarian game.They should also but the sushiria game on the iPads as well."
"7352",925494667,"Very fun game to play."
"7353",925494667,"There isn‚Äôt much to the game. It really shouldn‚Äôt have cost any money. I would suggest spending your money somewhere else."
"7354",925547937,"Just downloaded the latest update. Glad to see it still gets attention. Question: on the routes, what is the last one? It‚Äôs completely in Japanese, and doesn‚Äôt really do anything when you select it. Is that supposed to be a new route?"
"7355",925547937,"This game is the most best Train simulator on ios and this game is not a waste of your money"
"7356",925547937,"Always wanted to be a train operator and this is by far the best train simulator game I‚Äôve ever seen or played in my life would be nice to have a train operator view and maybe some customers waiting at the stations but would def love to drive my own A train line in NYC lol"
"7357",925770322,"Great game it‚Äôs sound design is amazing I like how there‚Äôs two difficulty levels for people who like to enjoy a game and for people who like a challenge 10/10 great game"
"7358",925770322,"I‚Äôve played this game maybe 4 times through and I still get stuck in some spots. This is a really hard game but worth the energy. When will they come out with the third? I‚Äôd love to see what they come up with"
"7359",925770322,"Some puzzles are just an exercise in frustration. The colored balls for instance. I play a lot of these games and was enjoying this one until I stopped having fun and realized how frustrated I was becoming. PLEASE OFFER A SKIP BUTTON!"
"7360",925838610,"This app did nothing and I think they paid for the good reviews but when I played it there was nothing but complete silence no shock either"

"7363",926058555,"I used this app to book movie tickets for my AMC Stubs account. It‚Äôs so good and fast, that I don‚Äôt remember booking through it. The experience is seamless, app has a clean UI, no crashes and the checkout was a breeze."
"7364",926058555,"It happened to me and my boyfriend. Our tickets were purchased & when we got to the movies they tickets were actually purchased by fandango by someone else!!! & they immediately refunded me which I didn‚Äôt even want I wanted them to give me another date ! Smh"

Overall this app is frustrating and has a lot of technical issues that need to be fixed."
"7371",926159169,"I paid $4 for an app that doesn‚Äôt work and emailed creator with no response. My granddaughter wanted to see her GPA for the year. Very dissatisfied!"

Elon Musk went higher than mars using this app. Moth got its lamp from this app. Thanos got his car using this app. Better than the tictoc app. It solved forknife depression and people who do forknife dances IRL."
"7378",927006017,"Portrait mode makes this game much less enjoyable. Why should I constantly scroll up and down just to see everything? Will be deleting this app soon if landscape mode isn‚Äôt made available again. I will not be playing, but will be checking back periodically to see if landscape mode is available. You are going to lose a lot of mobile players if you force portrait... My rating will change to 5 stars if landscape mode comes back! This is my first review to ever write and it is only because of the horrible decision to force portrait mode"
"7379",927006017,"Without landscape, game is too hard to play."
"7380",927006017,"Need landscape or I will not play. How can they think that we would want to SCROLL to see the whole interface? I‚Äôve never used portrait mode with this game and don‚Äôt even know how to play it that way. Hate the update, and done unless landscape is put back."

"7384",927117171,"These ‚ÄúDONT HATE‚Äù post are a bunch of nut loving bots.   I played football heroes 2015 and it was really fun to play. At first I didn‚Äôt purchase anything with actual money because it wasn‚Äôt needed for half of the campaigns. And when I did purchase some packs I had awesome gold players. That was to make the game a lot more fun. The problem with this game is you start out with default (weak) players which is understandable. What I don‚Äôt get is why the campaign is so pop sided with what seems extremely op AI‚Äôs in the rookie league. This game basically tells me to spend $$$ right off the back.. if you can‚Äôt put two and two together maybe you guys need to re-evaluate the level difficulty‚Äôs so that way nobody gets frustratingly ticked off why a 10mill dollar team is dominating a 2.7 mill dollar team. Get your heads out your greedy axes and try to gain more players by not making the game so demanding of $$ for better play makers."
"7385",927117171,"I want to give this game 5 stars, it‚Äôs a awesome game, but l used my OWN money to buy a QB and it states before you buy it the QBs you could get and it‚Äôs like Peyton Manning,Andrew Luck,Tom Brady, and Aaron Rodgers who are all pro bowl guys. I bought a new QB thinking it was one of them and I got I MICHAEL FLYNN he isn‚Äôt even in the NFL now.I also bought a new wideout and also got ripped off.I would totally rate this five stars but this is unacceptable.

"7386",927117171,"Pro 16 has some bad lags. I don‚Äôt think you should get it. Some times it does not recognize what you touch and does not work. I was playing and my guy did not move and I lost the game. Don‚Äôt get it!"

"7391",927823151,"I can‚Äôt find my photos. I took a trip to Yellowstone and got some amazing shots and now I cannot find them. They‚Äôre not in my photo library and I can‚Äôt find them in the ap. I wrote to them 3 weeks ago but haven‚Äôt gotten a reply. Totally bummed. One star cause support is non existent."
"7392",927823151,"This one only takes a single shot. When it combines multiple photos already taken (it cannot take multiple shots), it creates a less vibrant HDR than the older version.  All apps that claim they are HDR and not take 2-3 shots are fake and lie to you.  This app should be removed from app store and refunds given.  The developer is gone as well, you have no one to ask for support!  Rest in peace the old Pro HDR app, the true and only one that took separate shots at different exposures!"

"7406",929195587,"3* (undecided due to concerns and desiring more info)  Update: thank you for your speedy response, devs. It was the privacy policy that led me to the site listed below. Can search privacy policy for the site to quickly find it. Not enough time for me to invest and correspond with email just yet but, the app awaits on my desktop for now.  Thanks again.   I was looking over the privacy policy and love the layout (though the wording is flattering as it describes our role as if we are powerfully assistive. Lol.)   My concern came when I saw a business used to process some of our information. It was a foreign name (non-English characters) and the site was impossible to read! Even if I email them to opt me out of marketing, it seems this country will have access to my information. Not only that, the website connection is not secure (snooping & such possible with my connection info). Who are these people and how are they affiliated with our information?   As much as I love the layout, legality & contract terms sometimes aren‚Äôt easily & fully understood by me. Especially when their sites are a foreign language. Www.its.by is the site I couldn‚Äôt understand. Russian?   Anyways, I‚Äôll have to wait until I have more time to contact the game creators via support email.  This game looks entertaining and the reviews are enticing."

"7410",929302239,"I kept failing without a clue why. Sometimes I would randomly make it farther.   There is definitely a delay in its detection of presses. I have an iPhone 6 with the latest patch 10.3.3. Maybe the delay is a side effect."

"7412",929346489,"Omg guys I love this!!!"
"7413",929346489,"Dumb ways 2 is a fun game, that‚Äôs for sure but there were a small amount of problems. Like one time, there was an update, saying that they would make some improvements for better gameplay but once I tried that update, they didn‚Äôt really fix much stuff and actually made some stuff WORSE. So yeah, I love this app, just needs a little work."
"7414",930304174,"No point, I mean if you want to spend 20 minutes clicking away for a sub par story and some B class graphics, waste your money.   The app store shouldn't even be allowed to sell this trash."

"7422",930368978,"I expect this application to have all its user experience in the language selected by the user. You have plenty of resources to make this happen.  The suggestion that I belong to a Chinese group is disingenuous. I‚Äôm an English speaking user who wants to read my UX in English.   Let‚Äôs have a really SERIOUS conversation!"

"7426",930574573,"Just like all other ‚Äúfree‚Äù games, there‚Äôs ads and chances to earn diamonds by watching videos.....however once you get to 860 diamonds and keep watching videos to get more, it doesn‚Äôt give you any. Can‚Äôt find an email for the developer and I refuse to create a Facebook account to try and contact them that way"
"7427",930574573,"Look out Democrat‚Äôs this game maybe to intens for Cry Babies"
"7428",930574573,"Love it"
"7429",930868205,"Totally worth the 2 dollars. Me and my little brother used to play this game all the time on the computer. Got so excited when I heard a mobile version came out. This game has no bugs, It‚Äôs entertaining, and it‚Äôs not just a play it once then your done game. You definitely get your 2$ out of it."
"7430",930868205,"You have made it clear that this game is one of your best! I really want you to make more though. There is this one glitch were the children will stay in place but still walk in place. It‚Äôs weird. Please fix"

"7432",931337752,"I just wish I could read Japanese or there was a English version then I could have gave you 5 stars"
"7433",931337752,"Can you please apply the English translation of this game (which is now available on PS4) to the app??? I‚Äôd really like to play it in English."
"7434",931337752,"It‚Äôs pretty easy to follow, been playing for about 2 years and I don‚Äôt know Japanese.  It‚Äôs pretty fair in the gacha, as it rotates regularly sometimes it‚Äôs smarter to just wait for the guaranteed 5star.  Some of the challenge stages are near impossible, they‚Äôre almost set up to make you fail, but their still fun when you‚Äôre finally able to pull it off after months of prep."
"7435",932191687,"I feel very disappointed, I have Module and Ivory, but I bought American D, and only use Dark Piano, and it seems in last update it is not the same samples, what have change? It is unfair."

"7437",932191687,"This just has the best grand piano sound for the money. You could go to a music store and pay a lot more for a physical sound module that might, just might, maybe sound almost as good as this one."
"7438",932228293,"When I say ‚Äúnon-predatory‚Äù, I mean that the game doesn‚Äôt shove in-app purchases down your throat. It‚Äôs easy to pick up and play, and I can see myself paying for no adds. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs challenging, and I would definitely recommend giving Train Conductor World a spin."
"7439",932228293,"STILL CRASHES ON LOADING"
"7440",932228293,"It‚Äôs 5:54 in the mornin and it won‚Äôt work because when I tap the screen it just puts me back on the main screen of my tablet. If it‚Äôs something wrong with my tab I can let it slide. But if it‚Äôs the game then I‚Äôm given it a4 üíé wait a poop I put a diminn emoji instead of a star. Whelp see ya on the other side"
"7441",932236332,"It is my one of favorite games. It is very interesting approach to teach how to think logically. This app tried to deliver the basic concepts that kids should know and learn easily without any difficulties. Moreover, beautiful graphics promoted more kids‚Äô interest on this game. My son really loves this app. Whenever having a free time, he enjoys this.  Down and play it. Never stop playing!!!!"
"7442",932236332,"My preschooler loved it!"
"7443",932236332,"Another great app by the developer! Todo math is our fav app and my son loved their mini game called Matrix! Now they made it as a stand alone app. It looks like simple educational app but  it encourages my son to pause and think what block to go to correct spot! Great app for simple number games to all the way to fraction!"
"7444",932248553,"Lovely paper art style with relaxing music backdrop a game where milliseconds make the difference between success and horrible jet pack crash. And you will crash. Repeatedly. Because gravity, momentum, and the frailness of the human body are your greatest adversaries, not to mention the how off-balance you are. The simple two-thumb controls are as intuitive as your pack is unwieldy, and the game pushes you to fly through a series of timed challenges that steadily but fairly increase in difficulty through the campaign. After each failure, you can retry instantly, and the cycle of repeated attempts lulls you into a zen-like state as you slowly improve. This is a game that is difficult to learn and perhaps impossible to master, but easy to keep playing after each failure, because you know you need just one more chance. Or two. Or fifty."
"7445",932248553,"I had a lot of fun but it‚Äôs a little hard to control but that‚Äôs it"
"7446",932248553,"This game isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad game a like to play it a lot. It‚Äôs just some things that need fixing, for example the birds in the pier there is way to many birds and the hit your character causing some wierd movements. Also, sometimes the water and above cloud missions will be wierd because I clip the water and clip above the clouds and it won‚Äôt give me the check.So this game is really good but just need some minor fixes."
"7447",932315244,"I love it it is amazing but I‚Äôm not happy because I want all the nhl city‚Äôs in the game and I want more updates i have done everything but besides that so fun and can you make stick baseball please please please please"
"7448",932315244,"I love NHL and I love the game one thing like a bunch of other games I think you should be able to take a picture of the logos and change it but I love the game if you like the NHL then you will love the game"
"7449",932315244,"Was fun until the last few days, now there‚Äôs a huge add across the top of the screen making playing useless and frustrating.  BTW: annoying the hell out of me with obnoxious adds makes me NOT purchase the product... it actually makes me stay away from the product!!"
"7450",932389062,"mile the rule"
"7451",932389062,"I‚Äôve had this game for quite some time. While it is addicting and fun to play, it can be highly frustrating to get far into a level only for the tap to not recognize and fail you. Also, the daily challenges are completely inconsistent with the coins received. I‚Äôve tracked and some days are spot-on 150, but mostly I‚Äôve received 120-130 coins. Why say you‚Äôre getting 150, when in reality, you don‚Äôt?   Several bugs make the game frustrating.   Thank you for developing a game that is fun, but work on making it better."
"7452",932389062,"I really do enjoy this game, it‚Äôs sort of similar to geometry dash. I just have one thing, sometimes when you jump I wish the music was exactly on beat I guess but other than that I love this app!"
"7453",932441611,"This game is fun"
"7454",932441611,"Great way to kill some time compared to a lot of the garbage out there. And if you want to make some in-app purchases to speed up your progress it‚Äôs not unreasonable. My only criticism is that this game is ready for an upgrade. New cityscapes, trucks (conventional vs cabover), equipment, and jobs would keep it interesting and fun. But all in all a good game‚Äîno worries with this one!"
"7455",932441611,"I would love to have American trucks like the one in construction simulator 2 but I want the ones from there and a Mack superliner and Chevy bison with an off-road and free map off-road,spring,and winter with regular cars and pickup trucks hope to see updates thanks"

"7459",932500451,"Game content is decent at best, but their support system is the true downfall. You make a purchase in game, only have the game invite some sort of bug that prevents you from being able to use the contents of the purchase. Then a blanket ‚Äúgift‚Äù gets sent the entire community (even those who did not make purchases or get affected by the bug). So, you are out the money you spent to get ahead of the competition and you somehow ended up falling behind the completion."

Please explain why the game is advertised as fighting players around the world online... and yet it isn‚Äôt true. Why can I knock people out so easily? This game is soooo easy... for those of you who say it‚Äôs hard.. stop playin games.. seriously. This game would be soooo much better if I could fight against actual people!!! So much better. If that were the case, it‚Äôs probably the only game I‚Äôd play. So developers, either fix the online mode and make it real.

It worked great at first but every two to three days, it seems to delete my account and wants me to go to the ‚Äúactivate noggin‚Äù website and put in a code. When I try this, it tells me I already have an account and that I need to login. When I try to login, it tells me I need to put in a code to activate the Noggin app again. I just go around in circles!  I ended up having to delete the app, reinstall it, and login again. I wish this could be fixed because I am tired of having to do this over and over again!"

"7471",933135994,"Yea"
"7472",933135994,"This is a great game! My question is what are the ‚ÄúStandard Akinator Badges‚Äù for?"
"7473",933135994,"I used to love this game when I was younger and my friend recently reminded me that it existed.  I was flooded with nostalgia of the hours I would spend on this game trying to find the most obscure characters I could think of. I returned and tried to relive my glory days and picked a random NPC from Skyrim and decided to look for him. I began answering questions and saw as the questions got closer and closer to my character... but then once I answered the last question I was met with a screen reading ‚Äúthis is a VIP character‚Äù meaning that I would either have to pay or watch an ad in order to see the character... why? Why do I have to pay in order to play 20 questions with a genie?"
"7474",933189224,"Why is it better to have the character run around automatically as opposed to being fully controlled with the freedom to walk when and what direction you want? You made this game about boring timing and not exciting exploring."
"7475",933189224,"Controls are easy enough, looks great on my tv, creative, and challenging enough to be a lot of fun."
"7476",933189224,"Love this.  Have gotten so tired of all the games with IAP's and leveling up your character.  This is a simple game with beautiful graphics and great soundtrack that I find incredibly fun to play and don't have to spend hours playing.  Work of art."
"7477",933199580,"Not fare I can't download the game ........ Where my MONEY"
"7478",933199580,"This little gem has slipped down a slope of controversial loss of support. People see the beauty in it and cry about how they want more and since they aren't getting it, they berate this great game. Does it have flaws? Sure. Is it still boldly beautiful? Absolutely.   But here's the thing, wanna know why there's lack of bug fixing? Because as the developers were working on finishing it, the terror attacks in Paris of late 2015 occurred and affected this studios' people. That's right, put two and two together and you'll realize from their forum posts that they didn't have the capabilities to overcome what happened right after the first few patches of this game.  Are the controls tight? Sometimes a little too tight. They need to include a walk through because there are features of the game with no instruction. Like: you have to go back to town and talk to your Captain to change party members. But the end of this game has a trailer for what they hoped would be the rest of the story. And it leaves me thirsty for more. I'd say to people who want to still try it, know you're going in on a game that had a tragic loss regarding its development. Post to their forums and let them know what you like and don't like. But for all the work that was put into it, I'll give them 4 stars for what could have been the greatest Indy rpg on the App Store."
"7479",933199580,"Lack of support now from devs as they shut down studio"
"7480",933462805,"When I found this game it said ‚Äúbe the monster‚Äù and described getting to be the beast for once, facing off against warriors, destroying things. This is an outright LIE. Aside from decent graphics, this is a very generic, boring game, there is no story. It‚Äôs constant boss fight after boss fight, no substance or options or customization. It‚Äôs disappointing, bland and unless you like fight after fight with the SAME monster over and over and OVER again, it‚Äôs not worth your time."
"7481",933462805,"It simple and easy to understand and gameplay play smooth and I wish there more characters but it still cool"
"7482",933462805,"It seems that the devs abandoned this game. You cannot upgrade your character other then level even though the weapons and other upgrades say available later. There are only 5 monsters who continue to get recycled... what is this? I want my money back"

Called cust service and twitter support they didn‚Äôt help. Years of maintaining platinum accts, spent a lot of money and effort and I didn‚Äôt feel I was valued customer"
"7495",934390663,"I‚Äôve had this app for several years and thoroughly enjoyed everything about it. The artwork is especially pleasing and the hidden objects and puzzles add a great element to the story. I very seldom buy a game or in app purchases and kept putting off the inevitable purchase of the remaining books. I played thru the first two books a couple of times and each time decided I liked it enough to break my rule. But It wasn‚Äôt until my 5 yr old granddaughter got interested enough to actually play the game and needed my help that I finally bought the remaining 4 books. She is so excited, as am I, that we can continue this adventure!   Imagine my frustration as she skipped happily away to her Princess Tent to open book 3, and I picked up my iPad to start over from the beginning and play clear through the whole series, only to find that my purchase of the last 4 books is not recognized!! What‚Äôs up with that?? I can‚Äôt find a place to tell the app that I already purchased them! What kind of a rip off is happening here?"

"7499",934510730,"Best app ever since the beta version I got to test out I have been happy growing with the new versions and new IPad version. I came from using a Wacom tablet vs a mouse and this app is just amazing!!! Love what they are doing keep it up. Thank you for helping us do what we do!"
"7500",934510730,"Thanks to this program I didn‚Äôt have to buy a graphics tablet to create comics. I have a program that I use that would need a graphics tablet for me to draw. So I thought there is no way I can use my iPad with my Apple Pencil without exporting and importing which I did not want to do. After some research this program popped up. Man it is great! Even over WiFi it works wonders for me. I love it and it is perfectly what I was looking for. Now I can use the program to create comics and not spend more money buying a graphics tablet."
"7501",934540991,"This game doesn't work anymore."
"7502",934540991,"I love this app. My 2 year old loves it. There is a section with bouncing balls that once you place them, the option to place the same colored ball disappears. Please do the same with the animated stickers. We don‚Äôt need ten Scouts or Riders all over the screen. One of each character is quite enough. I know they can be erased, but that‚Äôs a bit harder for her to figure out. If you make this change, I will give five stars."
"7503",934540991,"This app won't load past the initial screen."
"7504",934596429,"Game started out great in 2015 and then developer greed turned it into a money pit. Had an awesome CP dominating alliance that was completely wiped out by the insane pricing. None of us could afford to play anymore.  You will spend hours clicking through endless trees of research that wastes hours of your time. The instant research is mostly broken.  Still not convinced? Then throw away your cash and get ready to waste a lot of your time trying to open thousands of Collectables 1 at a time. Dance Monkey! Dance!  The bad 1 star reviews are finally in the lead. Game deserves them."
"7505",934596429,"Good"
"7506",934596429,"Game is fun unless you can‚Äôt afford a pack. There is a way to fix this. Please allow alliances to send all resources T5 and T6 included. That would help tremendously from discouraging players that continue to get hit by much larger bases. If it‚Äôs an alliance we should be able to send whatever we have to our teammates! Fix this please. Thank you"
"7507",935216956,"This is a really REALLY good game, I love papers please and it‚Äôs an inspiring game to play. I love the mechanics and creativity that was put into this game and all in all I say it‚Äôs a 5 star rating"

"7509",935216956,"One of the best game ever"
"7510",935248296,"I had been very close to deleting this game from my iPad, but I am glad I didn‚Äôt because the publisher finally released an update that fixes the infamous ""assault bug"" where both sides would roll sixes every time in close combat. This bug had essentially broke the game since close combat is not only frequent but it also is often game-deciding. As an app publisher myself I was completely mystified why anyone would publish a game of this caliber and then completely abandon it without so much as a bug fix update for over a year. Even if it didn‚Äôt sell well, a bug-fix for something as egregious as the assault bug would have been a minimal common courtesy for those who did purchase the game I order to make it playable for them. I‚Äôm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 mostly because while the game itself is excellent, I can‚Äôt rate it 5 stars given the lack of service the publisher has shown so far. I will reevaluate that rating in the future if this update marks a renewed commitment to this title by the publisher."
"7511",935248296,"Fix the assault auto if a 6 die and I‚Äôll leave 5 stars."
"7512",935248296,"but you REALLY need to fix the bug where in assault both parties throw a 6 in the first roll, everytime. It is unacceptable for a boardgame, and I can‚Äôt see how it would be hard to fix.  The rest of the game is very nice, well done, very fun."
"7513",935306292,"It does sync steps with Health, but at least some third parties that track steps (Pokemon Go, Vitality) don‚Äôt recognize the total."

"7515",935306292,"App synced everything except my activity which is what I want it for in order to close my exercise ring. I allowed access to all info so not sure why it‚Äôs not syncing it."
"7516",935528099,"This game is so fun, its probably one of my favorite mobile rhythm games.   The DLC is only $30 for every single song they‚Äôve released in the past years and all future years."
"7517",935528099,"Be ready to deposit 30 dollar because it is worth it"
"7518",935528099,"In this I have reached 120% or higher on all hard levels and am currently working on inferno levels to 119%. Been playing for over 4 years and recently picked up the PC version and have already hit 12th place globally with less than 150 hours in it. Every time I hit a milestone it is a huge satisfaction. This game has almost taken as much time of my life as Geometry Dash and I have 4000 hours+ in that game over 6 years. Basically this is my favorite game and I will never stop playing. My ONLY problem is ‚ÄúI love my motorbike‚Äù I hate that song with a passion. It belongs on a moms Facebook not in a professional grade rhythm game. I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs children they are and how much money was given to have it placed there. But the rant is done and despite me having a problem with the game it stays 5 stars because one mistake is not worth overshadowing the rest of this beautiful game. Love you devs keep up the good work!!"
"7519",935559685,"How do I get a refund? If you are a left handed golfer DO NOT PURCHASE. There is no left handed option for a video. WTH do lefty golfer always get the raw end of the deal!"
"7520",935559685,"There does not seem to be a way to import videos, or it's not intuitive to figure out how to do so. A message appears that says ""videos captured outside of the app may not be optimal."" Giving rise to the assumption that the app has this ability. Here's the thing, I auto swing capture using a ZEPP sensor with a tripod set up usually at the range or at the course.  So not being able to import the videos is a huge disappointment."

Sorry for forgetting the periods in there"

"7529",935697665,"They didn‚Äôt ask you to pay for it right away you got five or six rides. However you only really needed two rides since it was a circular track and the ride only lasted about a minute. Otherwise good quality of ride. Check out if you have free time. Works great with Google Cardboard not blurry at all. Google Cardboard is a type of btw so you don‚Äôt have to by the real thing. I use merge vr and it works great!! üëçüèª"
"7530",935697665,"The coaster was fun, but the trial was bad"
"7531",935754064,"It lags and sticks and is terrible. Much better off using the iPad and Mac separately in multitasking"
"7532",935754064,"This app defies the planned obsolescence - giving iOS 9-era devices the ability to live on. Mojave hardware acceleration resolves my past issues. I still think the Sidecar pressure would motivate me to work on an Android version - many OEMs there block DP Alt Mode."
"7533",935754064,"Wireless connection doesn‚Äôt work"
"7534",936749679,"... except better. Controls are easier and falling diamonds don't kill you.  If you liked this back in the 80's you will love it now."

"7556",937261650,"Great game at first, then the levels start repeating and of course they‚Äôre not the easy ones. Now this doesn‚Äôt happen until your up there around level 600 or so, so enjoy while you can."
"7557",937261650,"I‚Äôve been having an ad pop up during the game over & over again. So I paid to remove ads & this one ad is still popping up every 30 to 60 seconds. It‚Äôs impossible to play the game now & infuriating that I paid for this.    Seller if you see this review please contact me so you can fix this."
"7558",937289819,"The aspects are great but you can‚Äôt resize photos to fit the aspect ratio. Your picture has to be tiny because will not fit to frame or you‚Äôll have parts of the photos that are chopped off. Even if you change aspects there is no perfectly square aspects one on top of the other.  Other than that it‚Äôs okay."

"7568",937793199,"So I love this app, I used daily for a LONG time, however many of the formulations for the oil blends are extremely out of date. As in those formulas haven‚Äôt been made in YEARS"
"7569",937793199,"This app used to be great when it first came out. Now it crashes and goes to a black screen every time it is opened. I have even tried deleting it and downloading it again. It has been doing this for about a year and still no updates to fix it."
"7570",937922348,"I love the game but we need more features I‚Äôve seen almost no changes from when I first played the game probably 3 years ago. I would love a trading option, or a pack that I could buy for coins because I don‚Äôt want to spend my cash. More packs in general would be nice, and a bit more to do with friends"
"7571",937922348,"This game is pretty fun but I wish they had an actual season mode,and please make the card packs cheaper."
"7572",937922348,"So I‚Äôve played this for a while have a 90 rated team and I can‚Äôt handle this anymore.Losing to a 54 rated 24-0 that is absolutely pathetic.I would say try this game but it‚Äôs absolutely shockingly bad.So if you try this don‚Äôt expect anything decent."
"7573",937976391,"App crashes every time we click play. We‚Äôve tried every category and the same thing happens. Deleted app and restored it. Updated iOS. Reset phone. Nothing has worked."
"7574",937976391,"I love this game because it teaches your kids all the different species, animals, and hats! And it‚Äôs totally free!!!! And it keeps your kids company. And it teaches them to listen to their teammate/s. And use their noggin."

"7578",937988895,"It looked like a fun game so I downloaded it but, when I opened it, none of the controls worked. I deleted it and redownloaded it a couple times but the game still wasn‚Äôt letting me play. I looked to see if it needed to be updated but it showed it‚Äôs last update was 1 year ago.

"7581",938095479,"I know this is probably tiring to see people ask for English translation over and over again, but it can take away from the enjoyment of the game. I personally watched the anime and hit the Wikia pages for this game to actually get what's going on.  However if you do ever decide to add a transition to the game, it would cause more good than harm.  Although adding another language means more work, English is one of the top most spoken languages in the world and many people who aren't from English speaking countries speak it so you would get more people to play your game and therefore make more money. If not for the fans of the game to enjoy it better, think about profit please!   Not to mention it's hard to do in game microtransactions when I have no idea what I'm clicking on."
"7582",938099257,"Not worth .99 at all. Pease stay clear of this App."

"7597",940006911,"Great mix of design, puzzles, environment and layering of tasks. Art direction, animation and audio are fantastic.   Having played nearly every point and click game out there, this is definitely on the short list, but I wish it was just a bit harder. I felt like most of the puzzle solutions were immediately apparent; only a few took some extra thought. That said, having played the first four chapters over a year ago, jumping into episode five felt abrupt and it took me a bit to get my bearings and remember what I had previously accomplished. It would have been nice to have a recap to kick off the episode.  But still enjoyed all of it. Looking forward to more!"
"7598",940006911,"Game started off great. Wait for almost two years for the ending was extreme. Ending is now here, and all I can say is what a disappointment. The last chapter was short, easy, and the ending came out of nowhere, and didn‚Äôt even really finish off the story. I should change my title, as this wasn‚Äôt rushed,it was just poorly done.   Don‚Äôt waste your time playing this. A lot of us wasted a lot of our time and money on this, and the developers really let us down."
"7599",940006911,"This game was a lot of fun to play. I don‚Äôt play a lot of phone games and this one made me want to play the game more often than not. I wish there were more games like this on the AppStore."

I told Angela that the credit union said the deposit was rejected so it went back to green dot she said they do not transfer funds to my bank that the irs does so I said how do you deduct fees for your TurboTax service before I receive my refund ‚Äúclick‚Äù if you would recommend this service to your friends and family press one. I have used this service since 2015 and now you can bet I am ending everything at this point.

I loved it  until one day when I logged on and wanted to spend money for a new pack. It was the future bass pack and it looked amazing then I was met with an unpleasant surprise, medly membership. I might delete the app but even worse for you guys you just lost money that I would have spent. RESIST THE GREED if it is attached to the membership DO NOT BUY IT.  Now medly I have no issues with a membership service if you allow separate purchases as well but it is wrong to lock it all down under that membership.   Thank you for listening to my ted talk."
"7609",940292587,"don‚Äôt do it don‚Äôt get sucked in because they will  lose all your levels and take your money now I‚Äôm waiting for them to give me back my rubies I paid for , lost 500!!!! and my luck I probably get screwed , have to go back to zero and start spending my money that I already bought.  All the money  I sent in addition to the 500 rubies I opted , paid to open 3 new places. It‚Äôs all gone . do not spend money on this game they will take it and give it back to u but make you start at zero !"
"7610",940292587,"Why are soooo many scenes in night mode?????  And, they stay that way forever!!!"
"7611",940292587,"Fun game"
"7612",940452319,"I love this game! But there are a few things I would suggest. Maybe you could make more ways to earn gems! Or you could maybe lower the price in quick play to not die. I love this game so much though! Developers, please respond!"
"7613",940452319,"The game is so fun I loved how you can get some nice characters and I loved how they  Looked The only problem was the game was glitzing but I still love the game  üòä‚ò∫Ô∏èüòíüò©üò≠üòÅüò≥üò±ü•µü§îüòëüòÖüòÇü§£üòÜüòå"
"7614",940452319,"How did you make this game it is the best"
"7615",940508574,"I love this app. I‚Äôve had it for years, it‚Äôs went through 4 or 5 different iPhones and it has always restored my purchase of the full version. Awesome app. Does everything it says and more"
"7616",940508574,"It‚Äôs ok I guess"
"7617",940508574,"This App really allows a person to be creative and accentuate certain aspects of picture for impact purposes."
"7618",940596201,"Get tap titan 2 ya the first version isn‚Äôt support anymore it dead and you can‚Äôt do much on it don‚Äôt get it."
"7619",940596201,"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"
"7620",940596201,"Love this game. Boom!"
"7621",941057494,"This game is is full of beautiful features and small touches that make it what it is, a masterpiece. It tells a sweet story of a star-cross relationship. At the beginning, you see where Nova is blown apart by a attack and you play as Kosmo and have to find each part of her in different crazy, cute, and creative worlds and put her back together! You even have bonus items to find that brings back memories that u can watch. The music is beautiful and every world is different. You have to use ur mind in every level because no level is made the same. This game will rip your heart out and put to back together from it‚Äôs beautiful art and touching story lines. This game is a must get if you love puzzles or just want to pass time and enjoy every minute of it!"
"7622",941057494,"Yeah sure this game is really great. but tiny their was my childhood. i would actually pay again to be able to play it. PLEASE! That game was a classic. i would do anything to be able to play that game again! :("
"7623",941057494,"This game is the best the levels were very challenging but I got threw it I really love this game so much and also can you make another one Love You To Bits 2 that would be amazing thank you for listening!"
"7624",941087958,"A pretty cool game so far."
"7625",941087958,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:7a3e164c4a3d2bc4 (or search the account name as ""ASO 100""). Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"7626",941087958,"This game is great, I had it on my old and loved it. As soon as I got my new one I downloaded it, I tried the second game, but I found myself coming back to this."
"7627",941107732,"My child new right away it was fake she started crying thx a lot"
"7628",941107732,"This game did not work when I tried it for my brother"
"7629",941107732,"i tried to do this but every time i filled out the info a ad would pop up and restart me from the beginning (DO NOT GET)"
"7630",941143328,"I like this game, I play it a lot and I am on night 6, but there is this one glitch with the mask. When there is a withered animatronic in my room I try to use the mask but it does not pull down. So I end up losing, but other then that this is a great game!"
"7631",941143328,"Look,I‚Äôm a big fan of Fnaf and the game, But I find it kinda of dumb that I can‚Äôt see foxy when flashing the light in his face, but he is really there behind one of the other characters because while I wait for the effect of the animatronic scanning me, he gets ready to kill me, plz make that he can kill me a few secs after the robots scan.  Thank you"
"7632",941143328,"This game is awesome. Would highly recommend even if you don‚Äôt like horror games."
"7633",941380906,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I HAVE PLAYED IT FOREVER! There‚Äôs just something about it that makes it SO fun. But I DO have 2 issues, neither of which matter THAT much, but still.  1. The fusion mechanic is cheap af. The ONE fusion is Alexandrite. That‚Äôs it. Wait wait wait, now I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs lame. It‚Äôs amazing! OMG ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TIME I USED IT! But it‚Äôs Only Alexandrite, and she‚Äôs reduced to nothing but a Super attack. 2.Garnet is TOO OP. Diamond Mode World 5 Gauntlet is the ONLY thing that can challenge my Garnet with an ATK of 39! U read correctly, THIRTY NINE!  P.S. If you want to skip the intro, just double tap the home button(or do whatever u do to open the app selector screen to instantly go into apps still open)& then go back in, the game glitches for a second and the intro ends immediately(it works for me atleast, if it doesn‚Äôt work for u, or if ur on a computer....sorry)Combine this with a setting so your phone doesn‚Äôt power off when u leave it alone and u can play hours of Attack The Light without turning it off ONCE.  P.P.S. If I had to ask for 1 thing, PLZ HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT BATTLE MUSIC, and Special music for the Gauntlets, the Secret levels, the bosses, and 1 special one ONLY for the FINAL BOSS! ADD THIS PLZ!"
"7634",941380906,"i‚Äôm like 3-4 years late but i recently finished playing this game with all 100% and it was such a great game. The mechanics and power ups was really great!"
"7635",941380906,"I love this game but the problem is there is not enough fusions one of my favorite reason I bought this game is to do all the fusions so please add more fusionsüò≠!"
"7636",941920716,"Needs skins, new animals, and obstacles. Hopefully y‚Äôall read this and add these too which would be Great ü§ó"
"7637",941920716,"This game is awesome üòé thank you for creating this app keep making more games let God be with you! ü•≥ü§©üòöüòãü•∞üòá"
"7638",941920716,"The force waiting was correct you should add more animals like A elephant üêòüêòüêòüêòüêòüêòüêòüêòüêò"
"7639",941931465,"I like playing to relax and this has a nice story and pretty pictures."
"7640",941931465,"The game is hidden objects and that it gives you. I really like that very much!!!! Not complicated at all üòÄ"
"7641",941931465,"Well thought out, good graphics, but freezing screens, or no frames  are frustrating.  I would pay except for glitches.  Videos for extended time don‚Äôt load, or they start to load at the next screen. Purchases disappear.  Too bad, it could be really good.  Want to make money on this?  Please fix the glitches"
"7642",941956069,"Whoever made this KEEP IMPROVING IT PLEASE it has a beautiful format but it needs updates it buffers a lot and has a bunch of technical issues.  If someone would truly spend the time and improve this it would be worth it!"
"7643",941956069,"This app is more money grubbing than motivational. Constant ads about ‚Äúbuy this if you want to be reminded about ___.‚Äù"
"7644",941956069,"It used to be a good app with nice inspirational quotes. But now it's mainly questions or promoting something. It's like getting a notification for an ad. It's really annoying and I don't think I'll be keeping the app anymore."
"7645",942003779,"I have played this game a few times through.  Currently trying to get highest scores on all levels.   This game has been out for a couple years and it‚Äôs still really good.  VERY SAD the developers haven‚Äôt added to the game in all this time.   The map looks like it has some possibility to add more levels.     If you want a challenge try to go through every level without killing enemies.   There are a few that you can do it on.   It‚Äôs a challenge but sad that there is not a difficulty bonus for no killing."
"7646",942003779,"I absolutely love this game! The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that I want more!! The game is a bit short for the money paid for it."
"7647",942003779,"The controls on mobile are terrible. Give me the option to play this turn based when I choose to; forcing me to play a game that rewards precise control that has a garbage control scheme is stupid design."
"7648",942413257,"Since one week, update 3.9.5, the app is useless. The screen is constantly flickering and it‚Äôs impossible to read anything. Before that it used to be my favorite weather app."
"7649",942413257,"Hello, any plans for an Update?"
"7650",942413257,"I‚Äôve used this app for 6 1/2 years.  In the last 18 months it‚Äôs gone from my favorite most used weather app to my most frustrating weather app.  Basically, Now it‚Äôs just LessCast,  or CrashCast, UselessCast, NoCast, ZilchCast, ZeroCast, CrapCast, & of course...  now it‚Äôs, DeletedAppCast.   Thanks for the total letdown!"
"7651",942494098,"This is a great game and there are no problems and I watch DudePerfet all the time and it is great"
"7652",942494098,"It‚Äôs a good game but the energy goes by 1 fast"
"7653",942494098,"This is so"
"7654",942766453,"There is ample evidence after only a few plays that the die rolls are wildly skewed and the AI sees your hand.  Probably okay for human players."
"7655",942766453,"Horribly biased rolls."
"7656",942766453,"Couldn‚Äôt even get through the tutorial. Not at all pleased wasting my money on this. Avoid."
"7657",943101317,"A great time killer. Clever with great graphics and timely hints. Looking for more like this."
"7658",943101317,"It's obvious what needs to be done, but I can't seem to find the perfect spot to pour the water into the beaker.  The developers ought to be ashamed of themselves."
"7659",943101317,"Little early to rate , but graphics are superior and story line is good.  So far, great game and worth the $"
"7660",943116454,"So far it seems great. Easy to maneuver from place to place, straight forward as to what you are getting and how to use it. Puzzles are challenging but you don't spend hours pulling your hair out either."
"7661",943116454,"Very tiny graphics on iphone 5"
"7662",943116454,"Friends & Followers,  Very basic game with twist at end of it.  Well detailed & vibrant background scenery with interesting characters. Casino style option for playing different styles/types of solitaire in ""Extras"" section is nice bonus.                           BUT Save money for another game: Too short in playing time, no map, strategy guide poorly written, hidden object & mini games not challenging at all (even for beginner) along with poor explanation as on how to play for some of them, too much back & forth between scenes, ""Mentor"" for magicians gives off ""creepy & sinister"" vibe due to artist's rendering & artistic presentation, voice synchronization deplorable and finally, ""collectibles"" are not well hidden, thus taking the fun out of the challenge that one is supposed to have in encountering them.  Thank you for continued support & following. ~Kamen Rider"
"7663",943587620,"Paribus is the second me. Always scanning and confirming delivery dates and prepares for any adjustments. I‚Äôve already used this several times to chat with Amazon or Target to get a price adjustment. Thank you!!!"
"7664",943587620,"In the time I‚Äôve had this app I never received a refund!!! This app is a scam."
"7665",943587620,"Paribus has contacted me a few times and has saved me so much money!!!"
"7666",943594558,"Please fix it anyone this game was the most fun but now i cant even play it right since it looks streatched out please anyone"
"7667",943594558,"Really great game well worth the 99 cents  a $1.  But needs diffrent modes  like one mode timed and one another mode no timed would love to see levels and more from this game"
"7668",943594558,"I love this game!! It is sooo much fun but it has not been updated in a long time!! Please please update this game!! Some new worlds or players!"
"7669",943837049,"Very difficult to find a lot of the objects!!"
"7670",943837049,"Instructions too vague.  The hardest Hidden objects game I have ever played."
"7671",943837049,"Not fun at all!  Rarely play anymore.  Don't like the graphics, either!  Penalized for tapping on the correct object!  Disappointed!"
"7672",943869618,"this game needs to be free"
"7673",943869618,"I love this you can do so much keep up the good work but can you add more please thanks!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"7674",943869618,"When I first got this game I was happy for like a month but after I got bored and abandoned the game. We need more food updates. It‚Äôs the same old food.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"7675",944011620,"First ‚Äúsmart‚Äù device I‚Äôve purchased and extremely impressed with how easy it is to interact with and get used to helping out. Absolutely love how it can connect to so many other devices as well. To put it simply, so cool!!"
"7676",944011620,"Alexa, stop playing music. Stop on the app on my phone don‚Äôt matter. Like she likes it and don‚Äôt want it to end. Even tried power off. Had to push the power button. I tried all variations of saying the words."
"7677",944011620,"On top of constantly switching signals and cutting out when I ask for sounds it only plays a short time, this is a recent problem. It doesn‚Äôt know the answers to quite a few simple questions. I ask for forecast and sometimes it answers ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that‚Äù in regards to my city but other times it knows. Infuriating! My friend has a google home and never has a problem! Hate this thing and I have three of them. Thinking of switching to google"
"7678",944165809,"I enjoy this game to the point that I no longer go to school. I only play Kaiser. Nothing else. (Just kidding but I wish I could.)"

"7681",944393180,"Hi, I just want to ask you if you could change the subscription thingy back to a purchase! Making elements was not premium a few updates ago. And you guys made a LOT more elements premium than it needs to be. If you guys change that, I‚Äôll be sure to purchase premium soon! See ya! ü•ß"
"7682",944393180,"I love this game but when I try to edit Fujins swimming animations the game crashes or the whole editing area turns black and than crashes and it makes frustrating to create a fujin creation. Thank you for taking the time to read this review"
"7683",944393180,"Hey there I started playing"
"7684",944644383,"Awesome love it cuts out real good"
"7685",944644383,"does the job right"
"7686",944644383,"Please update this one time purchase app to the same version as your subscription base model, this is the same exact app - but you have not updated it.  Will change to 5 stars if you can update the app.  Tried to get a refund."
"7687",944808246,"This game does not require WiFi, so you can play anywhere that you wish too. It might cost a bit of money but, in my opinion, it is really worth the price."
"7688",944808246,"I love them üòç"
"7689",944808246,"I love this game! You. Get cubs early, so many possible colors and quests, and it‚Äôs easy to survive! I live for hours! But I have a suggestion; ULTIMATEWOLVERINESIM!!!

Thank you for your time  PLEASE ULTIMATEWOLVERINESIM!!!"
"7690",944808252,"This game is quite disappointing actually. I was having fun doing it, but then I decided to look at the other dog simulators and they were free and had lots more choices for things like tame or stray. I absolutely love your horse simulator."
"7691",944808252,"They keep killing me I really don‚Äôt like it"
"7692",944808252,"It‚Äôs a great game and all I just wish there was more stuff to doüëå"
"7693",944985743,"But to get gold on everything you need to spend money to buy the last motorcycle"
"7694",944985743,"I like it except for not being able to fully see crashes because of the crash graphic that appears during every crash"
"7695",944985743,"Game is a good time waster, BUT, the bikes shouldn‚Äôt be as much as they are to purchase, we shouldn‚Äôt have to play a level 50 times to get enough money to buy the next bike. And as stated above, when the slow motion starts at the final Jim, how about slowing our time down along with the motion.good game but it has a long way to go to keep me occupied."
"7696",945077360,"Never any problem with programs or special events, well worth the money"
"7697",945077360,"Sling tv is the **it, I can watch all of my shows and record them...i also added stars as my premium channel, can‚Äôt miss PowerüòÅ Sling Tv is soooooo reasonable compared to Verizon, Direct tv, and Xfinity.

"7701",945177811,"Will you make a gorilla sim pleases"
"7702",945274928,"I have played this games for years now. It started out as a great game. But recently it is driving players away due to the lack of enforcements for griefing on lower level castles or players selling accounts that are claimed to be modded. Alliances are forcing players to either quit the game, join their alliance, or be attacked often enough that they are NOT able to do anything but retrain and heal troops. If developers would seriously listen to and work with players that actually play the game and NOT SPEND MONEY on it..this game would be great again."
"7703",945274928,"if you reset the cell phone and put it back on tea it starts until you already do castle 5 so you can use your old account it's stupid that"
"7704",945274928,"In June I made 2 in-app purchases at the same time. I only received 1. On my fifth ticket with customer service, I didn‚Äôt check on it for 24 hours. They closed the ticket because I didn‚Äôt check on it frequently enough. So I gave up. They stole 19.99 from me that day.   Today was the end of a month long event, the Lord Trials. For $9.99 you had a chance to open double the rewards. So I opted to join the advanced event. At the end I had 27 reward chests that I needed to buy a key to open. It gave a message saying that the items were sold out to play the event. It was an ongoing event.I spent the last 25 hours of the event trying to contact customer service to buy keys. The only response I got was to uninstall and reinstall the game. Which I did, after that I didn‚Äôt hear back from them.   If you choose to download and play the game screenshot every transaction."
"7705",945402023,"There's no sound we need an update for this app please! Anybody know who to contact about this??"
"7706",945402023,"There is no sound. The app is broken. Visually looks engaging though."
"7707",945402023,"Just bought this game for my children & there's no sound! Not very fun when they can't hear anything. Hope this issue gets fixed."
"7708",945434433,"This app is utterly useless. The developers managed to find every way to circumvent convenience and common sense, creating a completely unusable app. Thanks for nothing, jerks."
"7709",945434433,"They force you to buy a ticket through oui, after cancelling all train from Paris due to a fire, there was no customer service to help make other arrangements at 9:00 at night. I had to book flights costing 600 euros at the last minute. Poor customer service"
"7710",945434433,"Having everything in one place (ticket, discount cards, traffic info) makes this app extremely useful"
"7711",945621521,"Great games"
"7712",945621521,"Don‚Äôt get a lot of coins to play with and what you do get goes really quick. The bonus you may get may be big, but if you play a little higher amount it takes it all back. I did better at the casino!"
"7713",945621521,"I adore playing this game, China River, but over the weekend I received a huge bonus that was magnanimous. I was overjoyed but that was short lived because while I waited to see what my total bonus amount was I noticed that I received nothing. And it was a huge bonus. It has made me so sad because I have a great time playing this and as frequent players will attest to, we love our bonuses.  Who do we contact if we have an issue? Plz respond.  W Cmon people. I love this site but getting the best rewards is few and far between. Help out those of us who love this site. Plz keep us coming back."
"7714",945623719,"I remember downloading this game maybe two-three years ago, I didn‚Äôt remember but when I finished 5 levels apparently you have to pay mo ye to ‚Äúwin the game‚Äù it‚Äôs really not worth it. To be completely honest I‚Äôd rather play girls go games than play this.  Hope this feed back is understandable."
"7715",945623719,"Why do you have to pay money for the other levels. I really hate this."
"7716",945623719,"I want my money back because 5 yrs ago I bought the stupid bridge and it didn‚Äôt give it to me today when I re downloaded the game"
"7717",945832041,"Worked great for a bit and then the login changed and I can't access my work's VPN. We require a teuring code along with a password. It had a spot for the code before, but that has disappeares so I can't enter it anymore. This means I can no longer use this app."
"7718",945832041,"I would give this zero, continuously disconnects every few minutes, it is unbearable"

"7723",946099227,"I have been counting calories for nearly a year with this app and have lost 40 pounds to date. It tracks my food (not too hip on the new format yet) gives me credit for activity and lets me easily log repetitive foods. I‚Äôm still getting used to the new format. Jury is out."
"7724",946099227,"Update makes even basic features ‚ÄúPro‚Äù. Time to delete this bloatware."
"7725",946099227,"The new update sets calorie goals for each meal. The goal for each meal increases ratably as the user exercises during the day if the user wears an Apple Watch. Thus, if I meet my breakfast calorie goal of 450 calories and the get credit for 600 calories of physical activity, my breakfast calorie goal retroactively increases. What is the point of that? The previous version was more useful."
"7726",946168827,"Love, love, love this program. Initially downloaded this for my grandson, but found that I love it as well. So much so, I find myself myself on it more than him! Thank you for this fine program! Oma"

"7728",946168827,"Unbelievable app about wildlife, real family fun."
"7729",946382493,"I can‚Äôt get this app to work. It locks up on startup. Tried deleting and reloading and still won‚Äôt work. I paid $4.99 in in app purchase. How do I get my money back?"
"7730",946382493,"So I walks trying to start the game and it asked me to press the action button on my vr set, I couldn‚Äôt even start the game because I didn‚Äôt have an action button on my vr set."
"7731",946382493,"this app is incredible! it is scary and fun. i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good vr game! the paid version is much better than the free one, i will say. i play it every time i put my headset on. great game!"
"7732",946434924,"If I could have just one game, it's this one."
"7733",946434924,"This is the best mobile flight sim I ever played.  It beats other games by a long shot.  But please add helicopters it would complete this game"
"7734",946434924,"Would love to see F-16, east coast maps!!!"
"7735",946477821,"It‚Äôs nothing new."
"7736",946477821,"The only reason this isn‚Äôt a 5 star review is the puzzles. They‚Äôre not really fun, just sort of there."
"7737",946477821,"I like the game. Concept and all, but why can‚Äôt I switch between playing on iPhone and iPad? I started on my phone and now I would like to continue on my iPad but I can‚Äôt? I don‚Äôt want to start over.... it took too long to get where I‚Äôm at. Bummer."
"7738",946496840,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"7739",946496840,"This is a fun game and the time to unlock items is ok but when you finally do have enough to unlock a new ball it gives you ones you already have. Been trying for months to unlock one ball as to unlock a new level but can‚Äôt ever seem to get there. Good time killer though."
"7740",946496840,"I totally love this game! I am a basketball player ‚õπüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and the graphics are really good! And you get to play as a boy or girl! It‚Äôs so real! But...I would love it even better if you got to customize your hoop. It is already an awesome game and I have been playing it since last year! Thank you for reading this!"
"7741",946811576,"I used to play this game and really liked it but then got tired of it so I un-downloaded, and in that time it wouldn‚Äôt still let me play the game when the ‚Äúopponents‚Äù were getting ready and such but now when I downloaded back it wouldn‚Äôt even let me in. It would stop at the ‚Äúmysterious girl‚Äù then the music stops but the screen is still on but then it just shuts off. Went back in more then 5 or more times already. It‚Äôs really a disappointment since it‚Äôs a good game."
"7742",946811576,"So I‚Äôm using iphone6 to play the game and when I found a match and loading the game crash every single time I"
"7743",946811576,"Not sure what happened, I hadn‚Äôt played the game for a month or two and when I came back there was an update. I was like ‚Äúok‚Äù and downloaded it without a second thought, but now I can‚Äôt log in to my old account. Like, it‚Äôs still there, when making a new acc I tried to use the same name and it said an acc with that username already existed, but i just can‚Äôt log into it. Is anyone else having this problem?"
"7744",946903436,"This game is very good.But the fact that there‚Äôs only seven levels is crazy üòÆ!Because in this  is gamer show called Parker plays and there‚Äôs way more missions And levels like 0g     levels or bagel ü•Ø race you can even play a baguetteü•ñ but the only reason why you could do that stuff is because it was tv üì∫ edition. so can you please add the stuff from the tv edition to your pocket edition please so one last time can you fix this problem"
"7745",946903436,"I thought I would love this game but it‚Äôs annoying can you give us check points to make It‚Äôs a lot easier also it‚Äôs very hard with the controls especially with an iPad I don‚Äôt know how people get to the end it‚Äôs practically impossible please update soon and make this easier to win and play. ü•∫ü§ó"
"7746",946903436,"I paid for it it wouldn‚Äôt load so I deleted it and it won‚Äôt download   I‚Äôm so sad because that money was from my dad for my 12th birthday and he is in California I‚Äôm really sad üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"7747",946930094,"Really very useful app, like it."
"7748",946930094,"I use this for my consulting business. Documenting my work. Capturing data both paper and from digital screens."
"7749",946930094,"It‚Äôs great!"
"7750",947281623,"Hello I am a kid and this ruined my life now I know Santa is not real also I called him in summer and he answered One last thing THE STUPID THING IS JUST A BOT"
"7751",947281623,"Why did you switch from the realistic looking Santa to this janky looking mall Santa knock off? Very disappointing to my 3 year old grandson."
"7752",947281623,"So I tell him what I want for Christmas and he paused and I did it again and he said I‚Äôm stalking you so I was so scared so I tried to delete it and it did not and then the name of the game was stalking Santa so I figured out how to delete it you Just have to delete all the apps you have and I asked him please don‚Äôt stalk me and he said I hate you"
"7753",947402822,"This satisfies my desire to play this game when I'm on the go!"
"7754",947402822,"A faithful and well made version of the board game.  Polished, great sound effects and sound track and a fantastic campaign mode to keep you building the most ridiculous space ships.  Plenty of humor, had me chuckling many times. The designers and programmers did a great job bringing this awesome game to iOS.  I‚Äôm having a blast with it."
"7755",947402822,"lol at the review on top tgat said you should be able to ‚Äúbuy a prebuilt ship.‚Äù I think you miss the point of the game. You‚Äôre supposed to build ridiculous ships. the board game is a scramble for tiles irl.  That being said, why did the   app makers think it would be fun to pad a really  fast game with slow flavor text cut scenes and really slow redundant animations? yes there‚Äôs a FF button that sorta works...but it would be nice to have the option to play the actual game. also a drag that we cannot quit and restart where we left off without having to dreg through all the padding."
"7756",947529440,"My siblings and I got the Osmo genius kit for Christmas last year and so far all the apps work great. Masterpiece is actually really challenging though, and too hard for my youngest siblings (3 and 5 years old) to draw. They now prefer the latest addition to our collection, Osmo monster, where what they draw doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect.  As for he other apps, Osmo Newton, Osmo numbers and Osmo letters all work great, though it is a bit difficult for my siblings to find a letter in a huge pile of tiles. And Osmo tangram works well too, it just seems very dull and is easy to complete all the levels even for 3 and 5 year olds working together.  As for the Osmo apps as a whole, my siblings all enjoy playing games from our collection and have added the Osmo Coding and Osmo pizzeria sets to their Christmas and birthday lists! Thanks Osmo, for creating a great set of games!"
"7757",947529440,"This game is grate but it is just not loading.I tried everything so I don‚Äôt know what is happening."
"7758",947529440,"You make my drawings that I draw look beautiful because each time I draw something on Osmo it helps me to draw better thank you so much I love Osmo üòª"
"7759",947548754,"Not very difficult (a big plus for me), and it made me smile and even laugh out loud. Nice job"
"7760",947548754,"I liked the pixel style but didn‚Äôt care for the game that much. The puzzles need to be sharper and more realistic in nature. I understand it‚Äôs not meant to be too serious and we‚Äôre talking zombies here but a skateboard to fix a flat tire? Really? Who would think of that? It‚Äôs also just too much zombie for me so it feels repetitive. More people gave it a better score so it‚Äôs obvious that this game just isn‚Äôt for me."
"7761",947548754,"Do it !"
"7762",947624478,"Awesome game but don‚Äôt waste $2 on the paid version just get the LITE. They are the exact same. The only difference is that you pay for one and the other one you don‚Äôt."
"7763",947624478,"To short and can‚Äôt return for refund I will not purchase from fire rabbit again till I‚Äôm able to refund my app"
"7764",947624478,"This game is so awesome I don‚Äôt even no what to say"
"7765",947644950,"The app is great. When it works. It freezes every time I try to use it. Please fix that issue and I‚Äôll rate it higher. (Shopping at Whole Foods for pickup is all I‚Äôm trying to do. )"
"7766",947644950,"On ios 13, the application does not work in the background.  Just switch to another application, after 30 seconds, flex automatically closes completely.  Unable to receive instant offers.  Fix please!!!!"
"7767",947644950,"It‚Äôs frozen I can‚Äôt do anything"
"7768",947805279,"Mine stopped working after 3 months. I sent it back with the dated receipt and guarantee form. I emailed the company when I had not heard from them after a month. They ignored my email."
"7769",947805279,"They started out okay, but now it‚Äôs just becoming a useless app, no updates, crashes, not worth the time"
"7770",947805279,"It is impossible to register."
"7771",947824428,"Great photo app I just wish they had a video feature and more options for the camera"
"7772",947824428,"Fantastic app Please increase the number of mb in the high Rez and also kill the clicking sound !"
"7773",947824428,"I have had this app for just a couple days now. I have been using it mainly for landscape pictures including sunsets. The HDR software is by far the best I have used on an iPhone. The result has been stunning photos I could not have otherwise captured. I rate this app ‚Äòfive stars plus‚Äô from day one!"
"7774",948201260,"I like the game, a little tiresome when other players are in it to win. Bets high with no real cards, but betting high making everyone else fold. Not playing cards!"
"7775",948201260,"I agree this seems not so real.  I have to play more conservative because of the miracle cards that get me.  Some players go beyond locker room talk and make threats.   recently, adds pop up when you leave a table or moving around in the menus.  With all that being said i enjoy the game and hate the adds that pop up."
"7776",948201260,"Rigged!"
"7777",948478740,"Best Mac app ever."
"7778",948478740,"This app only works for locking the device but fails to unlock using Face ID"
"7779",948478740,"Doesn‚Äôt work anymore"
"7780",948561621,"I‚Äôm sorry, is this being updated or something?!? It won‚Äôt load!!! What is it meant for exactly! This is by far the WORST wait ever!! I‚Äôm wasting my time doing this. Please tell me? Also sorry I‚Äôm a little grumpy."
"7781",948561621,"This game is the best game I have ever played"
"7782",948561621,"No stars!"
"7783",948634806,"What are you waiting for!? This is a GREAT GAME! Please add some records, stats, a highscore table. No reason to play this game if there are no stats"
"7784",948634806,"I used to play a plastic toy like this when I was a kid. I liked combining baseball and pinball. This game works fine and has good graphics and sound.  It needs stats, leaderboard, and maybe another mode.  It is completely free, so thanks for the good work."
"7785",948634806,"Cpu dominates Trying to pitch is a waste of time Cpu gets hits at will killing the interest in a one sided affair Install only if you like a fixed losing game"
"7786",948715059,"Very nice"
"7787",948715059,"This game kept me entertained for ages. I haven‚Äôt got bored once and as you progress the game only gets more entertaining. Definitely recommend."
"7788",948715059,"It was fun when I downloaded it before, year later I reinstalled it, and still just as great!"
"7789",948757156,"Yikes. The new speed/class/pace tabs are terrible compared to the old speed tab. I always thought that's what set you guys apart from the other racing apps but now it's just like them.  It actually keeps getting worse. What happened to the horse info?  Past races, jockey, trainer, sire, etc?  I still can't get over how much I hate this update. I've never seen something so great go to complete crap so fast. Its taken the joy away of betting and watching races when not at the track. Please put it back the way it was. Why try to fix something that wasn't broken!??"
"7790",948757156,"Absolutely terrible app now. Video is atrocious freezes constantly. jockey and trainer stats combo stats are now non existent except for a few meaningless ones they removed anything useful. Definitely would not recommend new app"
"7791",948757156,"Why change, the app is a loss for me now. Even watching races is glitchy. Very clunky feeling and difficult to see workouts, past race videos, speed rating are a mess. Please reverse update!"
"7792",948805709,"The game is good. But it needs... BOSS FIGHTS! A boss fight appears before you get into Plankton‚Äôs time machine, but be careful, bosses have health. If you fail a boss fight you have a choice to continue, or go GAME OVER."
"7793",948805709,"It‚Äôs not very responsive. I bought it for my toddler and thought maybe he was just having a hard time buts it‚Äôs hard for me to play as well. My son LOVES anything spongebob so he plays everyday and everyday he gets mad as heck because it doesn‚Äôt respond when he swipes. An update would be really nice. It‚Äôs kind of overpriced for y‚Äôall to just say screw updating it. I can‚Äôt be the only person with issues."
"7794",948805709,"Please add more playable characters at least 1 or 2 Patrick‚Äôs."
"7795",948857526,"Love the programming and strategic positioning aspect in battles, the scenery, voices, and music."
"7796",948857526,"I loved the gameplay, it‚Äôs quite unique in my opinion, the visuals and music made this game. A hidden gem. Many story decisions are rather questionable though. But ignoring the story this game is one of my favorites."
"7797",948857526,"The screen ratio looks off on the iPad Pro 3rd gen."
"7798",948861271,"When I land, I can't move, like, I literally can't walk."
"7799",948861271,"here is why it's terrible. 1: I can't stop flying 2: I can't swoop on anything because it won't let me the game freezes 3: I can't pick up anything  that is on the ground 4:i can't find a mate, I've played this game for hours every day until today and I've searched everywhere but I still can't find another owl (same with ultimate dog sim)  ps I love every single game you make plz make more games üíôüêæüíô"
"7800",948861271,"Hello I found out why I can‚Äôt download this app it‚Äôs because you need to update this game and others. Update for iOS 11. Please I really want to play this game and others. Yes more also need this update. So please can you update this game and others to iOS 11. Please. Thank you"
"7801",948958859,"I love the game I‚Äôve only been playing it for one day then, today is not letting me get in SpongeBob game frenzy please fix that it was my favorite game I use it on my iPad I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening with it but please help. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my iPad or if it‚Äôs the game but please fix the bug if it is a bug! It used to be my favorite game in the App Store but now I can‚Äôt even play it so idk now... every time I go in it with my iPad it crashes like it doesn‚Äôt even make it to the beginning part.."
"7802",948958859,"Every time I get the right score it turns off and Then have to get the one score all over again"
"7803",948958859,"This Game is for epic Gamers"
"7804",949215818,"The game is good but I would to have more people"
"7805",949215818,"It‚Äôs good but it needs more characters pls add more"
"7806",949215818,"I don‚Äôt know how to choose different voices"
"7807",949255899,"I love earn to die it‚Äôs amazing it‚Äôs one of my favorite games I sometime draw my own zombie cars and sometimes I draw zombie cars from the game I love EARN TO DIE!!!!"
"7808",949255899,"If the game on different phones for the real versions are free why don‚Äôt you make it free on every phone"
"7809",949255899,"It need battle roux now scam man dan roux battle"
"7810",949281035,"This game is stupid don't git it"
"7811",949281035,"What would the first question be? Then I realized it was 9+10. The first time I thought I was actually looking for the answer and that I am really smart do not try to say ""YOU STUPID"". About after 6 or 7 addition questions, it took me to subtraction ones. Once I got to the multiplication questions and got a question wrong, they crossed out You Stupid and replaced it with You SMART. At least that was good. One reason why I am rating this 3 stars is because ads"
"7812",949281035,"I can't open the app, though I don't know why I was looking at these things."
"7813",949344041,"Not surprised the game is like it is, I have similar complaints for all of Line games and apps. Very little care or thought is given to all of us outside of Asia. We don‚Äôt get access to most of the good apps and games, we don‚Äôt get the free stickers that Asia gets - there are so many free packs Linked to company promotions for instance but we aren‚Äôt allowed to download them for some reason because we aren‚Äôt allowed to friend any of these official accounts so we don‚Äôt get their free Stickers. That‚Äôs just an example, but there are so many cool games I want to try but can‚Äôt because they aren‚Äôt available in our region. You‚Äôve taken away games that I‚Äôve played for years and years, discontinued utility apps that were cool, and same complaint with this game but in reference to the in app features. The app is greedy, for one."
"7814",949344041,"I can‚Äôt stop playing this game!! It‚Äôs so much in this game.I‚Äôm on 116 levels but still have so many things to enjoy with this game every day.I spent some money to buy the diamond  in the beginning to build my farm but now I collected it a lot from each event without spend money to buy diamond at all.Enjoy your farm and all super cute stores!!!"
"7815",949344041,"You think a game that‚Äôs three years old now would stop crashing. Fix the bug issue and it‚Äôs a 5 star game"
"7816",949498190,"This is an incredibly satisfying well-made game. I played it for years starting with the earlier versions. It's wonderful it's brilliant and kudos kudos kudos, truly, top of the heap.  Now the downside which is ninja mode‚Ä¶ I'm all for the limitations to challenge me, but it is ridiculous for the number of moves to be completely unpredictable! They do not correlate to pieces or anything else. There is no way to know if my six pieces are going to suddenly become three! Please please please make this just straightforward no mystery moves lost. Or if you insist on losing moves, Please make it clear and understandable how moves are lost!  ALSO: could you please insert a ""no, thanks"" button on all the offers for move, saves, swords, etc? It's really tiresome day have to sit and wait for the count down‚Ä¶"
"7817",949498190,"Love the game! Used to play all the time and re-downloaded this version. Only complaint is it‚Äôs kind of glitchy, I‚Äôll go to make a move and it‚Äôll be delayed, making me hit the stars. Another thing is so many ads. Other than that, great game"
"7818",949498190,"I absolutely LOVE the iSlash games, especially iSlash Heroes, and have played them for years... But PLEASE fix the problem in the ‚Äúninja‚Äù section of this game where you only get a certain number of slashes to complete each level- about 80% of the time, it counts each slash I make as two slashes instead of just one, which makes it EXTREMELY difficult to pass a level!!!  I‚Äôm not doing anything to make it do this and have tried different methods of slashing but it still deducts an extra slash from me."
"7819",949701151,"This game is the best I have ever played. I am so glad you guys made this game but I hope you can make story mode on the game then that would be really cool. PLEASE.PLEASE."
"7820",949701151,"I love this game bois"
"7821",949701151,"Niaaa"
"7822",949785353,"I played this game for several years and the gameplay is dead! The developers will not listen to the players. The game leans hard towards the Chinese. If you would like to spend a lot of money on a game with no gameplay this ones for you. Invest in something else pass this game by...."
"7823",949785353,"This game is all about spending. Game glitches on a regular bases. When you provide proof of game mistake they still blame user for there mistakes. If you do get help it‚Äôs based on how much money you give them not what is right. If you read this I advise you to pick another game rather than deal with this. Everyone is leaving as they ruin the game. You have been warned!!!!!"
"7824",949785353,"Plain and simple save your money thief server issues you get attacked because you can‚Äôt get on their server and they ‚Äútest their systems‚Äù after the updates then say no problem on their end must be your device or connection  Same story always"
"7825",949838009,"I‚Äôve had this app for a couple of years & I tell everyone about it when they laugh as I talk about my countdown to retirement app - then they love it & ask what it‚Äôs called so they can get it too!...I‚Äôve added other countdowns but retirement is my favorite!!!"
"7826",949838009,"I consider myself pretty loyal when it comes to apps. I rated it ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è there‚Äôs been one occasion where syncing deleted history. Other then that great!"
"7827",949838009,"App crashes on opening installed in iPad Pro 11 (2018). Have not been able to get it running in that particular iPad model. I have been an avid user for year's of this application in iPhone and older iPads. Even payed the upgrade. Would a fix for the crash at start up be fixed please?"
"7828",949870726,"I have been playing this game for about 6 years and honestly I enjoyed it. The cars looks absolutely great from the interior to the exterior. Being able to build your own shop and seeing the team you hired to work on your cars was a nice touch. The game also lets you customize the car with spoilers, front and rear bumpers, side skirts, rims(about 1-4 choices available), paint and the hood. But what I hate is that AI can be either slow and let u take the lead or they can smoke you!! There are times where my car rating was much higher than them but they still manage to smoke me. **Heads up, if you get the GTR in a FlashEvent be ready to get smoked cause once it takes off there is now freaking way you will catch up to it (even worse in the derby cause their is no chance of catching up)** also a tip: If you wanna win but you are neck and neck with the AI, push it into the guard rail he will lose speed cause of the dumb mechanic where if you scrape the car on the rail it loses all its speed."
"7829",949870726,"The cars really are impossible to fully control. You skid like crazy, the steering is faulty, and it is also pretty pay to play. But still I like it. But it needs the Porsche 918 Spyder, 911 GT2 RS, and 911 GT3 RS, Tesla Model 3 Performance, Aston Martin DBS Superleggera, Audi R8 And TT RS, BMW M8 and M5 Competition, Bugatti Chiron, Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, Jaguar XE SV Project 8, Lamborghini Urus, Aventador SVJ, Sesto Elemento, and Hurrac√°n Preformante, Lexus LC500, McLaren Senna and 600LT, Toyota Supra (2020), and Rolls-Royce Wraith."
"7830",949870726,"I love this game! It‚Äôs like TDU2 on the phone! Can you plz add free roam? That would be awesome! Thx! Keep it up!:)"
"7831",949876643,"When will the vertical ratio improvements happen?  I have been getting this pop up message since WAY before Christmas!!!!!!!  It is now April of 2019.

"7832",949876643,"I have spent 100‚Äôs of dollars for this app and only half of it works !!!! They said they were working on a fix , and that was almost a year ago. Don‚Äôt waste your money"
"7833",949876643,"AWESOME"
"7834",950022424,"I love this app. So many great products for great prices. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is sometimes an item I want isn‚Äôt available, but it it rare. Thank you."
"7835",950022424,"Jet does a good job. Less selection than Amazon but they are much cheaper on some items. Support Apple Pay which is nice."

To show that he would be worthy of a place in the pride. Only if he survived... He began lapping the water. ‚ÄúEven though the water is warm, but it‚Äôs sending me shivers..‚Äù thought Blackberry silently. Secret-keeper padded out of the shadows. Her paws making no such sound.

"7840",950299949,"The only reason I downloaded this app is because I can race my music but i would really love the app if you add YouTube support or you can make it easier for file transfer like you can work with files so you can transfer their or you can do something I JUST WANT TO RACE MY MUSIC please make it happen"
"7841",950299949,"I cant believe i spent $1 on this game because it said i can use my own music WHEN I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO AND THERES NO TUTORIAL ON IT EITHER!!"

"7851",950574221,"While the game is fun, it‚Äôs completely limited by in game shop which is not to mention in top 5 most expensive shops that I experienced online for a mobile game . Dear creator update the price and lower them don‚Äôt be a stupid selfish moron and idiot"

"7854",950593464,"Ok, so I‚Äôm really confused. I‚Äôm 11 and the only reason I‚Äôm 11 and here, writing a review is because I had this when I was littler and just now randomly thought about this game then came to check out the reviews. AS EVERYONE KNOWS THIS GAME IS MADE FOR KIDS AGES 4+ So all these hate reviews that are complex and use BIG WORDS, I‚Äôm confused as I said before. I don‚Äôt think that 4 and 5 year olds write this type of review. In fact, I don‚Äôt even think kids that young would be writing reviews. And sorry to everyone who thinks this is too much, it‚Äôs just my opinion. I know! These are just your opinions too about things to make the game better, but honestly do you really think that young kids that are 4+ will care about these type of things like having actual orders you need to take, characters too customize etc. And don‚Äôt get me wrong that‚Äôs great and all but just remember how much work that is for something that young kids probably don‚Äôt even care about.  Sorry this was so long, just thought everyone could think about this before writing your reviews. (If you made it this far then wow) Thanks:)"

"7858",950669893,"The only problem I have is the app won‚Äôt stay open while I‚Äôm walking. I‚Äôm constantly having to reopen to check my times."
"7859",950669893,"I was charged $1.00 without my permission by purchasing the app when it gives you the impression that it is a free app. I do not want this app to charge my card any fees as I am uninstalling immediately."

"7868",950823223,"The story is campy but it's kind fun. Where it lost me was when it introduced reaction-time situations. I prefer pure puzzling and adventure, not dodgem. So I decided not to finish this. Let me know if Elena saves her dad, k?"

When I knew I had solved it, but couldn‚Äôt do what was necessary, I checked a variety of video walkthroughs which verified the issue was Apple TV. I‚Äôve written weeks ago to the company, and they‚Äôve ignored my support request.   Generally, before that glitch halted all progress, it was way too easy and a bore. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
"7876",951346423,"I‚Äôve had this game for about a year now. I‚Äôve played it off and in through that and my high score I got today was 950... 100% recommend as it‚Äôs always fun to get on and try to top your own high score."
"7877",951346423,"some of these levels are just impossible they probably just randomize the different obstacles which makes the levels impossible at some times. along with ads, this game can make you very frustrated... i would give it five stars if they had made it a little easier. i understand if they want to make it challenging, but at this point, it‚Äôs not challenging, like i said, it‚Äôs impossible."
"7878",951346423,"The game is fun but it‚Äôs really unfortunate that the app turns off your music/ podcasts when playing"
"7879",951350964,"I‚Äôve used this app for quite some time specifically for creating stickers to use on other photos for my shop. It has been a cool ‚Äúphotoshop‚Äù type app for me.

"7880",951350964,"It does not work because like there are only some filters and like they are ugly and then if you want cool filter you will need to pay 0.99. And that is mess up that we had to pay and then some people got it free"
"7881",951350964,"This app just explains how to make lazy money. There is only a few filters, which you could get way more of with a million other apps. For all of the sticker the sticker that are free are stickers of Andrew Bachelor (King Bach) and the rest cost $0.99 each."
"7882",951364656,"Barely any ads, it‚Äôs very fun and addicting"
"7883",951364656,"This game is really fun and addicting,  but every time I start the game, an add pops up in the middle of the game. Since you have to click on the screen to move the ball, I always accidentally click on the add. Then, it won‚Äôt let me exit the add."
"7884",951364656,"I would like it more but TO MUCH ADDS it‚Äôs so annoying"

I only wake up to find silent pop up notifications.  And when I quit it doesn‚Äôt make a sound it just quits. Not sure what changed, but I can‚Äôt use the app anymore.  I was only going to submit this issue to the company, as opposed to writing a review, but it is glitching so badly that the feedback button is not working.  Please update it or let me know if there is a way to fix it on my end. This app actually did help get me out of bed, when it worked."
"7904",951876055,"This app WAS wonderful, but it is unfortunately no longer being updated to fix bugs. It doesn‚Äôt go off at the time set, only a notification pops up (about an hour after set time), and doesn‚Äôt prompt you to do any body, mind, or motivation exercises. I sent an email to support, but it bounced back. If this app gets support again, I will definitely re-download. Until then, I‚Äôve taken it off my phone."
"7905",951876055,"It doesn‚Äôt work. I used to LOVE this app. I downloaded it again about 6 months ago and realized it was broken. It rings like a normal alarm, and then that‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt do anything that it says makes it special anymore. I tried again this week but it‚Äôs still broken. It rings like a normal alarm and you simply swipe the notification and it turns off... no body, brain, or motivation wake up as advertised. It‚Äôs such a shame because it used to be an amazing app but I guess the developer accidentally broke it wit updates and then just stopped paying attention to the app. So disappointed because I loved it.

"7979",954323480,"Installed on iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 plus. Doesn't do anything at all. Widget is completely blank. Contacted the company two weeks ago, no response. Total waste of $1. Do not purchase."
"7980",954323480,"The last IPhone update and it won't open to play."
"7981",954549897,"Well, this is the 3rd game I pay for and it has crashed and it seems we are paying for games we can't even finish.  I was really enjoying the game and was near ending it when it just froze.  I was on the roof with the sun dial and the puzzle where Jack and Gall are in.  I was working the puzzle and all of a sudden it froze.  How about fixing the game?  It seems I am not the only one that experienced the game crashing.  Very disappointing!  An update on the 2/5/16 update...it did not fix the problem.  I still cannot continue with the game.  It is frozen.  Here it is the end of August 2016 and I checked back to see if any fixes were made to the game and NOPE!  It has frozen and cannot finish the game.  Paid for it and nothing to help its customers.  How about an overhaul so those that have had this problem can finish the game."
"7982",954549897,"This game played great on my iPad mini 2 with no crashes. I even updated to iOS 9.3 halfway through the game and it still played great. I love creepy, spooky games and this game was spooky. And the hint system is awesome. I loved it!"
"7983",954549897,"Game freezes. Rebooting doesn't help. No excuses."

"7989",954779921,"great"
"7990",955157084,"It is a really fun addictive game that you can enjoy"
"7991",955157084,"It is a great game it is so addicting when you die you want to play again but the reason I gave it only four stars is because if you keep messing up it will get frustrated but overall it‚Äôs a great game"
"7992",955157084,"So fun! Good for ages 8-12"
"7993",955170175,"I actually enjoy the game to be honest, but recently I downloaded it from the App Store and it runs once then crashes every time I attempt to play it afterwards."
"7994",955170175,"I hate this game because I was playing it and I beat my score and I was at 2343 score then they put an ad in the middle of the game then I lost"
"7995",955170175,"I think the game is a really fun and addicting game my highest is 331. The only reason. That i didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because of the adds and i also thought of suggestion. My suggestion is that when you die or get a new color there should be some cool effects"
"7996",955260074,"Easily one of my favorite games. I downloaded it ages ago and only deleted it to save space on my phone. Now that I‚Äôm back with it, I‚Äôm glad I came back for more. Still just as addicting and fun and right up my aesthetic alley. The only way I can see this improving is if we had the option of turning off sound effects so I can solve the conundrum of wanting to play but also wanting to listen to just that rad soundtrack."
"7997",955260074,"Good"
"7998",955260074,"It's a great game never had any issues with it just had not had a update in a while"

"8002",955286870,"If I click the three bars on the top left hand corner. It gets stuck open and I can't return to my search until I close the app. Very frustrating. The app is convenient but this glitch is super frustrating."
"8003",955286870,"There is an issue with the map view while looking for housing in Los Angeles, and California in general. It just places the map on an open stretch of ocean, and does not lay any pins/dots where the houses/apartments are located."

"8005",955290679,"Have you ever thought of, releasing this app on android"
"8006",955290679,"I keep reading reviews about the touchy trigger...are you all aware in the minimal settings, there‚Äôs an option to turn that off?  I think I got this app back when the App Store used to do a free app every week (they should bring that back, lol). It‚Äôs my go to when my brain needs to decompress."
"8007",955290679,"This is one of my favorite games on both the iPad and iPhone - a great way to pass a little idle time in an airport, or wherever you just want to shut your brain off for 5 minutes.  It doesn‚Äôt really need anything major - gameplay is still perfect and why mess with success, but it could use a few usability/device updates. It doesn‚Äôt fill the screen on the latest iPads. And as others have noticed, the rotation is a little weird - switching from portrait to landscape isn‚Äôt always a success. Particularly if you have a picture-in-picture video playing at the same time.  Also, I would LOVE to be able to move the pieces side to side using the iPad Smart Keyboard arrow keys. That would be amazing."
"8008",955298998,"This game is so simple yet very frustrating and addicting.üòÅü§ó"
"8009",955298998,"Not much to it. But entertaining none the less."
"8010",955298998,"I Enjoy This App, & Find it A Stimulating Addition To My Normally Stricter, ""Brain Training"" Style APPS! Fun."
"8011",955327604,"First off, there are almost NO ads, unless you count the little ones at the bottom. I loved trying to find the jelly drop things so I could make new characters. And also, the music is AMAZING!!  This is a really great game ;) nice job guys"
"8012",955327604,"This game is very fun and challenging, yet simple. I wish there was a little bit more to the layout and challenge aspect, but it is quite fun to see how far you can get the jelly to jump!! üòÇ"
"8013",955327604,"Jelly jump is one of my favorite games. It‚Äôs not to hard but not to easy, no glitches or bugs. I also love how it can be a two player game! The only thing I would recommend it more jelly Peices to use. Other then that, üòò"
"8014",955682952,"It won‚Äôt even let me click the gold mine when I first even downloaded the game. Complete waste of space."
"8015",955682952,"Can‚Äôt even click the mine to get out of the tutorial"
"8016",955682952,"Hi  there is a bug I‚Äôd like to report when you receive your first daily reward which is 5 auto mines you go to the mine to use them but when you click the auto button you get kicked out of the app this is a very annoying bug so I would appreciate it if the developers would fix it ASAP thank you for your time."
"8017",955705796,"I want to get back into this but I need controller support not just gameplay support but menu support too it‚Äôs 2019 why doesn‚Äôt this game have controller support"
"8018",955705796,"Great game"
"8019",955705796,"Amazing game just wish that you could get all the characters easier"
"8020",955832188,"2 starts because the app worked for two days and then stopped work all together.. This was a total waste of money.."
"8021",955832188,"When you get the app open settings and select your language or you'll have problems. Mine was in a language not common for the area."
"8022",955832188,"I sadly fell for this crap. Don't waste your money. It's completely bogus and doesn't work."
"8023",956794130,"This game was amazing. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like it at first but I couldn‚Äôt put it down. Really makes me thing which I loved"
"8024",956794130,"please its so fun"
"8025",956794130,"This game is interesting and calming at the same time. What the game lacks in frills it gains in beauty and simplicity. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and look forward to seeing what the developer has to offer"
"8026",956811074,"This is perfect for pulling diagrams and tables out of high yield review texts for classnotes without maintaining the in-book design.  I scanned a table and was able to make original looking notes in a concept map format from all the info within a minute.  Realize that this is definitely meant to do that, not much more.  The template can only be applied post editing, so you cant write on the paper background you want it in.  Only one pen option which you can change the style of in the post editing template area, but not in active editing.  The pen absolutely needs to have a smaller line width option - 3 available and to really use this practically, the narrowest setting is where I'd have a highlighter set to.  The app is great for not getting distracted and for what it is.  A few minor tweaks would make it excellent, in my opinion."
"8027",956811074,"Carbo makes pretty good scans, but it‚Äôs crippled by the lack of a viable export option. Users need to be able to select multiple scans and export them to PDF or other file formats. Until that happens, save your money and consider this unusable for most purposes."
"8028",956811074,"Was hoping for same sketching engine as on Inko, but it isn‚Äôt. And with no demo version, no way for me to test without costing $8.   At this point, I won‚Äôt use this app and wish I could get a refund."
"8029",957124541,"Love the board game...Love the app"
"8030",957124541,"I love this game because it gives the option of multiplayer. Countless nights I have played this with friends. The game is beautiful, with smooth graphics and extreme detail. Sound and music is incredible. The overall game is extremely fun, and very easy to look at."
"8031",957124541,"Very entertaining and stimulating gameplay, thank you"
"8032",957212695,"This game is amazing!!! It‚Äôs just number 1 I wish that there where other endings like you being able to wait out the storm and not get killed or if like you do something that makes the dolls upset causing them to try to kill you number 2 I think that there should be more of a story behind the game like why are there paintings of them on the wall or why do they want to kill you (as I said before) hope you take some of my ideas into consideration!!! Bye!"
"8033",957212695,"No matter how I put it in my headset it did not line up and I saw double in the game. Plus it is short and not at all scary."
"8034",957212695,"I love it it‚Äôs so funny when the sister turns her head!"
"8035",957302048,"I really feel great about this game because of all the graphics and sound effects.  They really feel awesome, they also sound like it‚Äôs real.  Games also great for player on player battles as well as player on cpu battles.  One suggestion is to add a few more vehicles so you can still get more cooler vehicles and already having good stuff.  Of overall its a great game and I hope Atypical continues with a this."
"8036",957302048,"Game does need t even work waste of money"
"8037",957302048,"I‚Äôve waited like three years so I can actually get the game and now it doesn‚Äôt open and now I want a refund"
"8038",957316969,"I love the gameplay but find the in-app purchase screen deceiving.  There is no way to get out of it.  All I wanted was to get rid of ads and after purchase, no way to get out of online purchases and back to the game."
"8039",957316969,"This is one of the most addictive game in the world"
"8040",957316969,"It ok"
"8041",957471210,"Should have read the reviews before spending money on the coloring pages. The app doesn‚Äôt work as promised. Want my $3 back."
"8042",957471210,"needs to have less things to buy so the kids cold learn for free"
"8043",957471210,"I love the app and it is the best game ever I cannot believe everyone else is super duper rude"
"8044",958174054,"This game is really cool, I love the T. rex escape and the fantasy roller coaster, but the simulator is not good for a few reasons one it‚Äôs plain two you can‚Äôt do anything in it and three I don‚Äôt have a three but I also don‚Äôt like the jungle but still awesome! 5 stars ;)"
"8045",958174054,"Personally I think this game has great potential but could have better graphics. This game hasn‚Äôt been updated in about a year and I wanted to give it 3 stars but took pity on the creators and gave it 4 stars. I have a crack on my screen so when I‚Äôm driving away from the T. rex the windshield looks cracked which is pretty cool. üëçüèª"
"8046",958174054,"It was really quick to download but it‚Äôs really boring it just replays the same  clip over and over      WARNING‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è bordom a head"
"8047",958455860,"The amount of content in this game and overall polish makes me feel like I am robbing square Enix for only 20$ price tag. Although I am still salty that I can‚Äôt play chaos rings 1 and 2 after paying for them I am satisfied with three since it is significantly better"
"8048",958455860,"I didn‚Äôt review it when I first got it a couple years ago because I thought there would be better ones, but there weren‚Äôt. This is the best game I‚Äôve ever played on mobile. The only game that comes close is KOTOR and that‚Äôs not even really a mobile game. It‚Äôs a port of a console game. Chaos rings has been around for a long time and it‚Äôs still better than any game that‚Äôs ever featured on iTunes."
"8049",958455860,"They just don‚Äôt make games like chaos rings anymore it‚Äôs actually sad to me. I love this series I still play the original three on my older devices and wish I could play them on current devices, I mean I did pay for them, and they are still on my phone, so it‚Äôs kinda crazy that they just don‚Äôt work I expect more from square enix, though I‚Äôve been disappointed since they ended guardian cross, song summoner, and so many other great games.  Anyway I short review of chaos rings 3 this is the best game on mobile currently, the controls are perfect it was made for mobile so it‚Äôs not a crappy port of a better game. The music is beautiful and hits you in all the right places at the right times. Story is a little complicated at times but after you‚Äôve caught up and understand it‚Äôs a great story with every character brining a lot to the table, there are no weak characters here, though I may be missing something some storylines seem to be open ended 5 years or so ago I thought they were just leaving it open for the next game, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coming. Graphics are really amazing for the time and mobile I would say it‚Äôs early ps3 level though some corners are a little blocky and animations could be better. Finally gameplay I love turn based rpgs though I prefer atb style this is alright faster characters get to attack first but it is straight turn based, and I‚Äôm not that into the card based level system with the rarities and combining it seems like you were trying to make it seem ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù style with out actually being able to pay for it.   Thank you square for the amazing games please bring back the older games we all love and paid for, and please start making real games again."
"8050",958604518,"This game is so engrossing and stunning. The writing and gameplay is top notch. The soundtrack and mechanical knowledge is unique and makes this game so much more impressive. I‚Äôm very impressed. One of the best games I‚Äôve played, and I‚Äôve played a fair few!"
"8051",958604518,"I love this game. I played it over and over. Then I went searching for other games that were ‚Äúalmost‚Äù as good but have yet to find one. Developers, I hope you make another game soon like this!! Thank you!"
"8052",958604518,"It‚Äôs a gorgeous game with a interesting story and that‚Äôs where the draw ends.  Cons: puzzles that without grandpas diary would be completely unsolvable because there‚Äôs no logical way to deconstruct them.  If you‚Äôre not playing on a 55‚Äù flat screen you‚Äôll be pixel hunting for places to move and items to pick up.  And when playing on Apple TV the remote is terrible for any puzzles that require timed movement to complete puzzles."
"8053",958763157,"I Got my Man to Play this Game and We Love Itüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
"8054",958763157,"This game is so addicting! You‚Äôll want to never put down your phone ever! It‚Äôs a great saving game. And you can socialize with friends!‚≠êÔ∏è It is a great game for people who like the fight war kind of things! So download the game and fight dragons!!!!!üê≤üê≤üê≤‚≠êÔ∏è"
"8055",958763157,"The game is very fun and entertaining. Besides collecting dragons and participating in weekly event, the main attraction in my opinion is the community. The people are great and you make a lot of new friends. However, the people at pg need to step up their game and take the community seriously when issues are discussed. Overall a fun and a good place to make friends."
"8056",958848462,"Fun game, please fix tizoc‚Äôs the SP feature for Justice hurricane and Big Fall Griffon"
"8057",958848462,"I have an iPhone 7 Plus, the highest power iPhone model available at the time of writing. There is no reason why this app can't run on my phone. It runs at what feels like half speed at all times. The King of Fighters i-2012 runs better on this phone and not only is it extremely old and built for old devices, I'm pretty sure it has more going on under the hood. I've played this game on the Nintendo Switch and at EVO so I know that it's normally a good game. It is astounding how such a fun fighting game is given this sort of treatment. This game would make Street Fighter IV Championship Edition look like a complete and utter joke if only it was playable."
"8058",958848462,"Oh yes the greatest fighting game ever made, just for my new iphone!"
"8059",958904868,"I‚Äôve an American fan of the moomins since I was about 12 years old and this game just warms my heart. I love farm games and stuff, so this is right up my alley. Also, this is very easy to pick up and play so I strongly recommend it for any moomin fans, new or old, big or small."
"8060",958904868,"This Game Is SUPER CUTE!!! Moomin,& All His Friends, Plus You Get To Decorate, Grow, Win & Play. It‚Äôs A Win WIN Situation!!! It‚Äôs One Of My New Favs!! I Also Have Happy Garden,& Alice! There All Super Cute And Just As Fun!!"
"8061",958904868,"With interactive characters and an art style that mimics the comics very well, this game is better than any other farm game, especially if your a Moomins fan."
"8062",958957112,"So don‚Äôt mess with this your other franchise you can use kodi it it is illegal but it‚Äôs streamed to one line so you won‚Äôt get in trouble"
"8063",958957112,"I think that this can get you arrested don‚Äôt fall for it"
"8064",958957112,"I think this is an amazing movie app it has VERY many movie and tv shows I love I just wish they did have more tv shows such as riverdale and things like that otherwise this app amazing and you need to try it (BTW I‚Äôm not a robot I know what a crosswalk isüòÇ)"
"8065",959304067,"The best app ever  üòç"
"8066",959304067,"Love the game and it‚Äôs very easy and addictive"
"8067",959304067,"i get a fish I CANNOT EAT IT!! Plus I can‚Äôt find one of the nest sights.But ADD DEER SIM NOW I WILL GO NUTS IF YALL DONT horns male no horns female.and when the baby is level 3of it still has no horns female.but if horns start to grow it‚Äôs a boy!"
"8068",959327054,"When I originally tried to download it I thought it would download on its own and I went off to play a game, but when I came back it had no process in the downloading! This was very frustrating as I had to go on the App Store and stay on it until it downloaded, I also had some trouble with the app opening but eventually after a few tries it opened and I was able to enjoy it."
"8069",959327054,"Yes"
"8070",959327054,"I just recently got a VR Headset to just chill and go through the VR experience and it‚Äôs amazing! I first got Google Cardboard which this app is compatible with and it‚Äôs amazing! Just before writing this review I did the Lego Batman experience and the Mission Impossible mission and it‚Äôs pretty amazing! I‚Äôd highly recommend this app and if I convinced you, hope you enjoy! üòÑ"
"8071",959390742,"I looove snail bob! It is such a delightful puzzle game!  You can tell soooo much work went into each unique level. Figuring out what lever to pull or what to tap to get to the end is great fun.  Finding the stars and puzzle pieces makes for an added level of interaction and might be my favorite part.  (though i also like failing the levels sometimes too just to see what will happen hahaha). Snail bob was such a great game, and snail bob 2 is a great addition."
"8072",959390742,"I love the game‚Äîplease bring out the new levels! Need more Bob!"
"8073",959390742,"A great follow up to #1... Tons of innocent fun and with little challenges throughout. Love the touches of humor.  Looove this app! So fun"
"8074",959452391,"Very good game"
"8075",959452391,"So this game might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely unique, and in a sea of clones, I appreciate that.  The mechanics may seem screwy to some.  But if you try a practice round or two, learn from them, and try again, you'll realize that not everything is unintentional.  There are some clever tricks at play here.  Bottom line: It's just a game, after all, and life is too short to be led around by naysayers.  Give it a whirl!"
"8076",959452391,"This is really fun and takes some thinking. I just wish I didn't die so much!"
"8077",959469304,"Great port, runs at full speed! Only problem is the wonky controls, but the Special Assist button makes it easier!"
"8078",959469304,"Great port of the awesome classic Fatal Fury special!    I did notice though that all the in game text (not menus) and title screen is in the Japanese language localization version, even when I switch the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù option to ‚ÄúEnglish.‚Äù  Doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay as the game in game options and in game difficulty settings are in English, but it would be nice to have the USA localization, especially the fantastic winning battle quotes.  Also, if the game is open and I switch to another game and then back the game force closes and I have to reopen it.  Other than the non-game breaking issues I mentioned up above, this is a flawless 5-Star port, Fatal Fury Special rules!"
"8079",959469304,"This games is excellent and i really REALLY wish that you guys add more games. I‚Äôd be happy to play them all. Fatal 1 and 3. Or even better add Real Bout Fatal Fury"
"8080",959619034,"Really cool easy controls"
"8081",959619034,"The first part is pretty easy it will get hard but it is easy"
"8082",959619034,"Love Flight Pilot! Totally addicted!"
"8083",959937622,"I don‚Äôt like it that much"
"8084",959937622,"I SAW I VID OF THIS AT YT KIDS AND THIS GAME IS WEIRD 1.why she need some clothes her chest though üòë AND NOT DOWN LOAD OK GEZZ THIS GAME DONEST WORK I WANT TO SEE FOR MY SELF?!? THE VID IS SO DUMB AND INAPPROPRIATENESS"
"8085",959937622,"Game is so awesome! I love it because it is so cute! Although it would be better if they had a different number of kittens each time. Overall it‚Äôs a pretty good game."
"8086",959954514,"There are many fun and entertaining games out there, but this app was truly a joy to play. (Even multiple times) :) An extremely creative way to utilize your phones abilities in ways you didn‚Äôt know possible as well as bring a smile to your face!  I‚Äôd give it more stars if I could!  Looking forward to more levels in the future :)"
"8087",959954514,"Great game!! Fun and really keeps you thinking"
"8088",959954514,"I got the app for free for a Starbucks promo, so I didn‚Äôt have to pay, that was 2 years ago. They said more levels would come. I‚Äôm still waiting"
"8089",960128616,"I used this app for a really, I mean really long time and you added that you can plug to Xbox. How do manage to do that?"
"8090",960128616,"I love this app it helps with my Minecraft worlds but all of a sudden it stops working. It says be 1.12.0 or up and I‚Äôm 1.12.0 but it still says cant connect vpn please respond"
"8091",960128616,"For some reason I cannot host a server on my iPhone XR and it makes me sad. Because I could do it on my iPod touch which is older. I can still join servers but I also want to host them. But other then that the app is alright."
"8092",960161732,"I am Incredibly impressed with this game. The levels are short but the game never gets monotonous (I‚Äôm on something like level 250 after a week). It has ads, but they are quick and not at all too repetitive."
"8093",960161732,"This is both the most relaxing and rage-inducing game that I have ever played on a phone."
"8094",960161732,"I really like this game and it is so nice I have played through it once and know I‚Äôm playing again."
"8095",960251959,"New update keeps crushing."
"8096",960251959,"Enjoyable and 2 much fun"
"8097",960251959,"It‚Äôs a Nice interesting game, I don‚Äôt have issue with the downloading but when I‚Äôm playing the game it just hang of a suddenly...pls what can I do to stop that occurring"
"8098",960506557,"Is there any reason why we cannot connect"
"8099",960506557,"I love this game so much! I have a few ideas though I was wondering if you could add a melee mode with swords,knifes and stuff like that. Also maybe a multiplayer were someone else plays with you but you don‚Äôt fight them you defeat enemies side by sideüòé also maybe pance customization"
"8100",960506557,"They need to add AR15s, Scars, and M416s"
"8101",960708632,"I love this game, but this new update I can‚Äôt play my games without it being interrupted by a blue screen or ads, so sometimes I have to close it out and reopen it and still have a blue screen then it reloads. I never leave a review but this time I think I should let you know of the glitches on the game."
"8102",960708632,"Game is good but need a way to earn jewels so you can buy needed items. Should not have to pay to advance in the game. Takes forever for your health to regenerate so you can play."
"8103",960708632,"I loved riddle Stones and have played up to level 3000 plus with my old I-phone 6 Plus. Now I have new iPhone XS Max. I downloaded Riddle Stones to continue playing but I found that I have to started  all over at Level 1. Is there a way to get my old levels."
"8104",960716999,"I told you already! Out like a light"
"8105",960716999,"If it‚Äôs a sleep time app, I don‚Äôt want to open the app and have the background all white. If you make it dark, then when you are ready to open the app, you are not blinded. And what happens in the middle of the night when you want to keep the noise going...? Whiteness."
"8106",960716999,"Awesome sounds for free and the optional add-ons are reasonably priced. I saw one review that suggested having all of the sounds in alphabetical order so that they‚Äôre easier to find, and I do think that would be cool. But this is a great app that‚Äôs super easy to use. I also love how I can pause it from my lock screen! The app I was using before this didn‚Äôt have that feature, so I‚Äôd have to unlock my phone and open the app to pause the noise. This is great."
"8107",960744514,"I play this on zen mode (untimed). Like all great games the ‚Äúrules‚Äù are simple and intuitive. The contrasting colors cancel each other out, making this a superb way to practice combining negative and positive numbers. But The Mesh is not math practice masquerading as a game‚Äî math is the engine. Each level prepares you for harder challenges ahead. Mistakes make you work your logic muscles harder. The graphics are elegant. The spinner rewards add a welcome element of luck. And the icing on the cake? It has an end. I still play it despite having beaten it at least a year ago."
"8108",960744514,"Or maybe another new version. I'm pretty sure that people will appreciate that Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"8109",960744514,"I got this app when it was free. It was in the beta stage I think.."
"8110",961227503,"I tried to buy all tools, but it ended up trying  to charge $24.38?!?!! It says it‚Äôs 0.99. Everything else is great but AirMix is difficult. Hidden charges, brought down 2 stars."
"8111",961227503,"AIRMIX doesn‚Äôt work, does it use nfc?"
"8112",961227503,"So I was looking for the solids in the chemical list but they were ONLY liquids in the list, like acetic acid or hydrogen chloride. And there appears to only be 18 chemicals (6 being colors) in multiple varieties in amounts (I think) and also I sat for a full 2-5 minutes waiting for AirMix to connect but it never did.  Oh yeah, it would also be cool if you could select single elements like potassium or hydrogen and radium to see how they react to each other. That‚Äôd be cool. Pretty good game/app."
"8113",961339405,"I love this game there is so many things to do and yeah it‚Äôs a small price to pay for this 10/10 game"
"8114",961339405,"This is a ‚ÄúSims‚Äù with a prison plot. Don‚Äôt let the cheesy graphics and corny dialogue fool you...this  is a great game! With over a 100 characters to choose with different storylines and personal goals...this game has a high replay value. You have so many tasks to complete in order to progress the story line. Survival has never been so much fun! Best of all- one time purchase and no in app purchases. And no subscriptions. Just pay ONE TIME and have fun. I definitely recommend it! AND NO...THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEW! I AM A REAL CUSTOMER WHO ENJOYS CREATIVITY!!!!! Note: Maybe add some more gangs!"
"8115",961339405,"This game is so detailed and awesome, I just hope that they come out with new characters."
"8116",961390574,"Well presented and accurate. This is one of the few apps I use every single day."
"8117",961390574,"Since the latest update, the Apple Watch app on my series 0 does not work. It tries to open for a split second, crashes, and I'm back at my watchface. As a result, the complication also doesn't work. Reboote my watch and phone, still nothing. The iPhone app is great, but 90% of the time I'm checking the weather, it's on my watch."
"8118",961390574,"Best hilarious, non-spying, non-spammy, clickbait-free, fully featured weather app there is. Paid tiers are totally worth it, if it means I don‚Äôt get blasted with ads or my user metrics and GPS/battery gobbled up and sold by the big name ‚Äúfree‚Äù apps. Notifications are great. Data source variety is great. The update for iOS 13 works nicely with Dark Mode, including a new dark radar map that‚Äôs easy on the eyes.  Those reviewers put off by the humor: Understand that the theme here is a malevolent AI that mocks humanity, so if a forecast comment runs counter to your personality or political settings, it‚Äôs probably an intentional attempt at contrarian humor along that line. Maybe just turn off the snark altogether to avoid being triggered, if susceptible."
"8119",961411124,"This game is silly, but pretty addictive"
"8120",961411124,"It's a pretty fun game."
"8121",961411124,"This has an enjoyable story and I'm all about trying as hard as I can to not work!"
"8122",961648591,"Great app."
"8123",961648591,"This app keeps crashing!  It's so frustrating for my son!"
"8124",961648591,"The game is constantly crashing and skips pages all the time. My son loves the tv show but he gets very frustrated with this game when all it does is crash in the middle of the coloring, pages skip all the time, and the camera feature doesn't even work for taking your picture with the dino bots. Very disappointed and want my money returned! Not worth $2.99 at all!"
"8125",961662290,"I don‚Äôt how stupid y‚Äôall are but losing your coins when you try to create a Kingdom & someone else already used that name is stupid asf"
"8126",961662290,"Lords and castles delivers great strategy in medieval and operations that they used back then an every decision would be like the descisions that an actual king would do and make like from the movies and shows"
"8127",961662290,"All the things in the photos are fake u can‚Äôt even do them"
"8128",961875786,"This is fun"
"8129",961875786,"Adds between every level."
"8130",961875786,"Easy at first to get you hooked then it gets very challenging.  Good game to play while waiting for an appointment or whatever."
"8131",961889853,"This game is not for everyone. It definitely makes you think. If you‚Äôre looking for a one trick pony, you won‚Äôt find it here. Is there a challenging category, cause that‚Äôs where this belongs. Give me more please."
"8132",961889853,"The game world is almost empty. One side mission, the screen went black. All I had to work with was my mini map. Controls are very touchy, but work okay on my iPad Pro running iOS 9.32.  With some more TLC this might be a good game, but it needs a lot of work and more content. Seems like a demo or work in progress game. 2 stars for effort, but really you need to finish the game.  EDIT: Crashes on my 5th gen iPod touch running iOS 9.32."
"8133",961889853,"In a high stakes game like this, in is hard to sneak around when every time you try to walk with the joystick controls, your dog character breaks into a sprint. And when you try to turn it runs forward more than sideways. That alone takes away two stars from the gameplay.  The story, art, and characters are great, though! If you can get over the control issues like I have learned to, or use the tilt control. This game is a blast that I‚Äôd definitely recommend!"
"8134",961932335,"Instead of updating all these little apps can the developer please update AnalogFilm instead? That was one of the best photography apps and even tho some of us have purchased all these newer apps with almost no filters compared to AnalogFilm, we still want the old one back."
"8135",961932335,"I have this one, Paris and Portland. I love them all. I like that it's just several perfect filters and not 20 worthless filters with 5 okay ones and 3 great ones like many of the big bundle apps. Paris is my favorite but this is a close second."
"8136",961932335,"This app has a problem with the default functionality. The exif information in the picture is not normally saved. This error is a fatal problem when arranging photographs.  Also, the interface is outdated and inconvenient to use. There's no update for a long time, but I don't know if the developer will update the function."
"8137",962056217,"I built up 2000 contacts and this app made it so easy to delete 1500 of them without having to go into every single contact. I have the latest iOS and it worked perfectly."
"8138",962056217,"It's not deleting all the contacts that I selected!!!!"
"8139",962056217,"know that this is version 2 because when iOS updates, you will have to buy this app all over again! it‚Äôs bad enough that apple does not give you the option to delete contacts, but these people thrive on them updating (which apple does constantly) to recharge the suckers who already paid for it."
"8140",962084488,"th' game be amazin' anyone who doesn‚Äôt play it will be in jail"
"8141",962084488,"played through the game in less than an hour, including time to explore all choices available. plot was extremely simple, no ‚Äúmystery‚Äù as described. Game seemed to have a preset path that i couldn‚Äôt stray from, not many choices even available. I want my money back."
"8142",962084488,"It would have taken 10 minutes if you could speed  it up. Beautiful music and graphics but the price is ridiculous for the short experience. I will not be buying from this group again."
"8143",962144693,"I love this app"
"8144",962144693,"It goooooooood"

"8153",962289279,"This game was the best. It was hard but fun. Now it makes you pay to get further. It‚Äôs not fun anymore."
"8154",962289279,"Fantastic sense of speed and really good velocity mechanics. This might be the smoothest mobile game available, running at a silky 60fps.   However there should be an option for left thumb steering (90% of racing games I‚Äôm aware of steer with left pad/stick). Same for auto-boost, I‚Äôd prefer manual control for that as well."
"8155",962397288,"I was able to beat level 4... after 3 years of trying. I think the level should be made easier. Also I think there should be an end to the infinity zone because it becomes rather repetitive. Great Game though!"
"8156",962397288,"I deleted this game because of all of the ads every 2 games an ad pops up and you can‚Äôt skip them and the over 30-60 SECONDS LONG and the Same exact AD IT SO annoying but the app is pretty good but still th ADs makes this a 3 star"
"8157",962397288,"This game has been fun for me, I‚Äôm still trying to find an end to the infinity zone, my high score is above 10,000, would there ever be an end? And for level 4, it‚Äôs not impossible, there‚Äôs a technique, so right before you jump on the square, as your falling from your jump (not off the square) then hold on right, and that‚Äôs how I did it! Your welcome! But I have 1 question, is there an ending to Exit Zone?? If there is, please tell me and comment to my comment"
"8158",962473684,"Fun game to playüëë"

"8162",962566898,"Very frustrating!"
"8163",962566898,"This is a very fun game but the last pack release was ages ago. I hope they keep updating the game."
"8164",962680846,"It‚Äôs a nice game but every time you pass a level you will have to look at a frozen screen and wait for around a minute before the next level starts"
"8165",962680846,"This was my favorite game until last six or seven months. It started taking its time to download. Everyday it became slower and slower. Now for last  three days, the game will  not completely load. This was a five star game but I gave it one star because of the problems.  Probably should be a no star until it fixed."
"8166",962680846,"Very good game but lately is to slow loading"
"8167",962713931,"Game is enjoyable and fun until you get to the boss in the abandoned mines. Then you have to end it there. Poor controls and a terrible mechanic make it impossible to win. I‚Äôve spent an hour trying to kill this thing. Max level, all silver equipment, oh and the one time I might actually want to use a healing potion, I can‚Äôt. Cool game, too bad this boss is terrible and the controls are basically beyond useless."
"8168",962713931,"Controls feel great. I like that they upped the run speed in this one. Story great also! This and Lunar Silver Star Story are some of my favorites :)"
"8169",962713931,"Love Ys, despise these kinds of ports and this game in particular. This game is great on the platform it was originally formatted for (ones with directional pads and buttons), on iOS you have to drag your finger around the screen and/or mash parts of said all the while trying not to completely obliterate you field of view (which is both insanely easy to do and will likely result in getting murdered by bosses over and over again (to the point of rage)).   Summary, this game should of been left to the PSP, the shameless cash grab that is the mobile port is garbage."

"8181",962993853,"No fun watching all adverts.  Deleted"
"8182",963034692,"Allow us to them the entire app not just the icon. Thanks!"
"8183",963034692,"This is one of the very few apps that have had a tangible, positive impact on my life. That being said - PLEASE allow more than 12 tasks to be tracked. I would be willing to pay for that functionality alone! 12 is just not enough"
"8184",963034692,"If you are buying this to use on your apple watch, DONT! The app is so bugged it is unfunctional. A complete waste of money. Save your dollars for a developer who updates their app regularly to maintain the promised funtionallity of your purchase and doesn‚Äôt run away with your money to creat more bugged apple watch cash grabs."
"8185",963037888,"Can you please add skins it would make it more fun"

"8187",963037888,"Only rating this poorly because they still haven‚Äôt fixed risk dice algorithm"
"8188",963067330,"This game is great. I have some ideas for Cookies and Pets As  Rock Candy Cookie Class: Epic Ability: Rock Candy Bits appear at certain intervals. They give points when collected. Level up for more points for Rock Candy Bits. Magic Candy: Crystal Candy replace Rock Candy Bits. They give even more points. Ingredients: 25 Purple Sugar Crystals, 15 Solid Purple Sugar Crystals, and 5 Sparkling Candies.  Pet: Shimmering Crystal Ability: Creates Shimmering Jellies. Favorite Gift: Purple Sugar Crystal. (He loves purple crystals) Least Favorite Gift: Bronze Hammer. (He prefers pickaxes over hammers)  Relationships: Adventurer Cookie: Friendly (They like showing each other treasures they find) Rougefort Cookie: Tension (Both see each other as bad. Rock Candy takes all the jewels, and Rougefort tries to steal them.) Avocado Cookie: Trust (Avocado makes pickaxes, and Rock Candy gives Avocado metals to work with.)"
"8189",963067330,"Wishing either for a re-release of the older oven breaks, or the old oven break costume. Making the original 4 stages of number 1 and the original I think 8 stages come back with the addition of being in the cookie rush : oven break if you can't post the games back up."

"8191",963668030,"I think the game is fun but there‚Äôs one problem all the other games except for home and other places are locked I don‚Äôt think they should that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm only giving it to stars other than that it‚Äôs pretty fun"
"8192",963668030,"I love the game but I don‚Äôt want to waste my money for the locked stuff..."

"8194",963753435,"It is soo good"
"8195",963753435,"I have made my best beats here and it‚Äôs awesome"
"8196",963753435,"I‚Äôve only been playing around on this app for a couple of days and I‚Äôm on the free version. The only reason I haven‚Äôt gotten the paid version yet is because I generally only pay for apps that I legitimately need. This one will probably be my first exception to that rule. I can‚Äôt play any instruments. I love music but i have no musical education. None of that matters here."
"8197",964064306,"Very bad just one lap thought it was gunna be something fun to play. Don't bother."
"8198",964064306,"It's not really even a game to be honest. You have no control over the kart, only one lap, and looks like garbage. I've never seen a VR game this bad. Above all else at least make the kart take corners like they should in an actual race. It's like the driver has no experience what so ever. Poor 'game' overall."
"8199",964064306,"The game should be playable."
"8200",964351449,"This app is great for trail info and helped a lot for navigation too!!!   One suggestion, why not showing the exact number of remaining length and elevation? Since it my locations in the graph. It is super useful yet it is hard to eye ball it."
"8201",964351449,"Best hiking app everything is perfect"
"8202",964351449,"Hiking project used to make it so easy to see your location and overlay it on the elevation profile so you can see exactly what mile you‚Äôre at and the elevation. App is now not intuitive when trying to select the loop you want and is difficult to use to orient yourself."
"8203",964436963,"I say this game is fun for everyone but there is to much ads for new players, who willing to play but still I recommend this game! Also be sure to do the stadiums that brings a lot of fun but I don‚Äôt you have to for each day to do a stadium for keys so that‚Äôs a problem really perhaps?"

"8207",964738592,"I‚Äôve been trying for over a month to connect to Facebook and the game won‚Äôt. I contact to developer and got an email back to update the game. My phone and the game are updated and still no luck. Emailed the developer three more times since my first email and they haven‚Äôt got back to me.

"8219",965096605,"I had originally owned this for PC, but after playing it on my IPhone/IPad the game was so much more enjoyable for me; this game is perfect with a touch screen. I hope they eventually port the sequel onto IOS or the Nintendo Switch."

"8233",965965461,"this is my #1 boredom killer. Legit all I do when I‚Äôm bored or I have no internet? time to play this. I love these games.. keep going!! üò©"
"8234",965965461,"I really like how this game is really simple but still fun. But there are are a lot of things that can be added, like earning coins  and unlocking new pancake flavors. I think that would make the game more interesting."
"8235",965965461,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"8236",966030326,"So I am very new to this app but in previous I‚Äôve owned Korg triton extreme . I bought Korg iM1 with hopes I could have use for some music writing in daws such garage band . Soon to be logic and I recently got a app called beat maker 3 can this be used inside beat maker if so how can I get it to record these sounds * I‚Äôm even willing to pay you for your support in walk me through this process. Please Korg/?"
"8237",966030326,"Some times the patches plug in great some don‚Äôt  I purchase all cards for app I think sounds are great  I would buy again"
"8238",966030326,"I was anxious to try out the iM1 app as I was once owned an 01W in the early ‚Äò90s which followed the famous M1.  This app brought back so many memories & didn‚Äôt disappoint in the least. Highly recommend if you want a terrific modern update of the original M1 sounds in an IOS app."
"8239",966038711,"This game fun, I enjoyed the puzzles and the hint feature was great."
"8240",966038711,"Fun, Engaging and Challenging with enough clues to solve all the puzzles without being too frustrating."
"8241",966038711,"Thank you!"
"8242",966057213,"Easy to use and give me all I need in just one app That why i decided to purchase life time plan yesterday. And i am satisfied so far"
"8243",966057213,"A seemingly simple App, but VERY useful and MUCH appreciated!  It allows the user to do the following: Create tasks (as many as needed or desired for the day, the week, or the month), Color-code them, Prioritize/Arrange them, Allocate a time to work on one you presently wish to focus on, Designate a break, and Assign sounds to signal the end those times.  In one day, I accomplished more than I have otherwise been able to do because the App kept me FOCUSED on my task!  My thanks to the Developer!"
"8244",966057213,"I set a long break after 4 pomodoros but it takes 6 pomodoros to start a long break. I spent money on this app but you can‚Äôt even count the right number in your coding!"
"8245",966099615,"4 stars because although the app seems fine (brings me back to the ameba pico days lol)  , it would be great to include an english patch for it (and other languages as well) , so that many of us can fully enjoy the app üëçüèª I would play it more often if that request is fulfilled!"
"8246",966099615,"It‚Äôs a great game I think I can‚Äôt read Japanese so I don‚Äôt really know what to do but it does have a really good art style I wish it would have English in it so I could tell if it was good game or not but that might not happen because the developer might not know English"

"8248",966169065,"Update: there is a mode to play without time limits, so I‚Äôll bump up to three stars.   It‚Äôs gorgeous and unique. But hampered by inaccurate touch detection and time limits.   It would be much more enjoyable if there were a option to just untangle the knots and enjoy the experience rather than racing against a clock. Part of the appeal of this game is simply enjoying the physics engine and watching the knots respond to touches."
"8249",966169065,"The graphics are nice and it seems as though it would be a fun puzzle game, however the controls are so awkward it almost makes the game unplayable."
"8250",966169065,"Was $2.99, stopped playing three levels in, was just really not fun at all.  Controls are pretty wonky.  Might be a bit more fun without a time limit"
"8251",966333863,"I could not complete the tutorial with three places merely because I did not set a warrior to the site or some other glitch. Could not move forward and could not move backward to correct the situation. And this was at tutorial level"
"8252",966333863,"Yes, you have to pay for it, but if you buy the whole adventure path youre getting 30 adventures and endless party configurations for replayability.  This isn‚Äôt a free-to-play mobile game but you get what you pay for.   It adds an ok story element and great music both missing from the physical card game that originally cost 4x the price of the full bundle for the app."
"8253",966333863,"I am loving this game. I had Pathfinder card game at home but it wasn‚Äôt as much fun when we had to spend so much time on figuring out the rules. I love that this takes out the work and lets me have fun.  I really enjoy the strategy of the card deck building and the choice of characters/location.  It usually takes me a few tries to win a scenario, to get to know it and plan for it.  I love the challenge. It is one of the few iPad games that I enjoy the playing of itself, rather than the enjoyment of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù or ‚Äúgacha‚Äù aspects where you are collecting heroes or whatnot.  In this game, I really enjoy the whole experience.  I purchased the entire set of adventures, which is well worth it for the price, especially if you enjoy the introduction.  The story/dialogue is brief but funny and enjoyable too.  I am getting attached to my heroes!  It did take me some time to really understand all the rules but that‚Äôs part of the fun."
"8254",966509113,"Get it amazing game and adorable baby‚Äôs"
"8255",966509113,"ava-rose sesssssssse"
"8256",966509113,"Let‚Äôs start off by this is a HORRIBLE GAME EVER! It‚Äôs always giving you adds and once you reach a certain level it says you have to pay for it and just NO all the levels are just to plain easy and not even realistic!!! Also ONE LAST THING... honey don‚Äôt spend your time on this peace of crap‚úåÔ∏èüòâ"
"8257",966758561,"It‚Äôs stupid you charge a transfer fee y‚Äôall already take a sales fee smh"

"8259",966758561,"My app is frozen on the same screen and I can‚Äôt use it.  Tried rebooting, tried closing app, open back to same spot.  Worthless."
"8260",966764324,"i love this"
"8261",966764324,"I get how it‚Äôs cool and all you know with all the variety of music and everything but I dont like how you have to pay everything like if I wanted to I could just surf in the iTunes store instead"
"8262",966764324,"Just needs more songs I think of songs that would be cute in this form old n new"
"8263",966810173,"Good game I wish they made it Easier to Get Resources All in All 10 out of 10!!"
"8264",966810173,"For the starting tutorial, your screen is tinted and your told to click on whatever button was illuminated. This isn't the best approach to teaching new players, but furthermore the tutorial droned on and on... I got tired of just tapping this button and that button. I want to be able to explore the game, safely at first, then with some element of opposition after that. I want to make mistakes and get away with it, before the game really gets going. Please have a look into this. I highly recommend ""Game Maker's Toolkit"" on youtube, it teaches good game design by example."
"8265",966810173,"Great game I like it"
"8266",967351793,"Great app! Love the comparison pics you can make with it üëç"
"8267",967351793,"This app is fabulous! It‚Äôs very easy to use and I love the different grids. Seriously great collages every time."
"8268",967351793,"This app is great, when it works! Without fail it ALWAYS crashes before I can complete and save a collage. I‚Äôve deleted and downloaded a new app because of this. It‚Äôs been well over a year that this has been going on so any new updates have NOT fixed it."
"8269",967383325,"But it's fantastic!! Brings me back to the days of classic Nintendo RPGs with lots of meta references. my only criticism is perhaps too many in jokes but it's a love letter of a game.   (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)"
"8270",967383325,"The music is non-existant even with maximum music volume and the audio breaks or stops working after playing for about 10-20 minutes and requires the app to be closed and opened again to recover whatever remaining audio this game has.  I do like the up-to-date references and jokes the game offers."
"8271",967383325,"Wonderful RPG but some glitches kill the experience a little bit... like how the music cuts out rarely or the SFX. But, most of the time, it is there."
"8272",967502646,"Only after purchasing did I find out that the host software does not work with Mac OS 10.13.6, High Sierra. No support on this SW version and my MacBook cannot be updates to Mojave."
"8273",967502646,"bought the new app after having version 2 for years becasue i bought a new ipad pro and the new app is juas as bad and buggy as the older ones. the bigest issue i have is that the USB display extend does not work."
"8274",967502646,"Only after buying this app did I learn that the corresponding macOS driver was incompatible with macOS 10.13.6.  That information should be prominent on the App Store page.  I cannot upgrade my Mac to 10.14 for other reasons right now.  How do I get a refund?"
"8275",967624193,"This game is great for taking your mind off your problems without adding any extra stress to your life.  These puzzles are simple but they still make you really think if you want to solve them quickly. Solve enough of them and you start to notice patterns. Eventually, you learn enough of these patterns that you can solve them without thinking much, but they are still rewarding.  I‚Äôve been solving these regularly for a few years and today achieved 1000% completion on all 8 levels, and I‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs easy to redo puzzles so I can keep solving them.  Thank you Lummox Labs!"
"8276",967624193,"Clever, and once you understand the algorithm, the rest is just applying it."
"8277",967624193,"I finally finished the entire game!! It took me about three and a half years, but that‚Äôs including months-long breaks (oops). Either way, I finished it and I‚Äôm sad there‚Äôs no more puzzles to figure out but it‚Äôs such a great game and I absolutely love it!!"
"8278",967812288,"Awesome rally game and I love using my mad cats controller with it! I spend an whole hour or two playing this game it‚Äôs neat. 11/10 would recommend. Also keep the updates coming! I would love to see new content! It would make this game legit #1 of rally games on mobile! Would love to see more cars and more tracks!"
"8279",967812288,"Thank you for keeping this gem alive and healthy. I love it."
"8280",967812288,"When I down shift I accidentally shift down too much. Please make it so you can only down shift once per click. And make the very small shift indicator on not cockpit view way bigger.

"8288",968744559,"Oh My god, This is retarded. Instead of a Sonic Boom Exploration game for Mobile, they made something that is actually worse than Sonic Boom: Rise Of Lyric Wii U. This is more pointless than Sonic Dash. Sonic Boom has been ended years ago, and this app has been going down. Make a good Original Sonic Platformer instead of crap."
"8289",968744559,"It does not have all the sonic characters from the classics.Its fun but I recommend if you sort of like sonic do not get it. And why do you have to pay for the extra characters. U should try it out but I have played this before and they need updates. It could be a lot better.and there is only two bosses. In the classics and other games there is most of the times five or six. This game needs upgrades and updates.its good but need to be better"

"8298",968953976,"Just a couple grievances I can think of atm. It‚Äôs not a ftp friendly game. I‚Äôm only here for my guild at this point honestly.  The clock is off by an hour and it‚Äôs driving me nuts. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a time zone/ daylight savings thing but I don‚Äôt remember it this way. Raids don‚Äôt match guild fight hours even though the schedules are the same."
"8299",968999008,"pretty good but maybe make another creepy goat simulator game!"
"8300",968999008,"These games get pretty boring after playing them and unlocking all the goats and secret areas I would like to see a new update with new goats and new places but there still fun games"
"8301",968999008,"Every time I play I kicks me out and It‚Äôs very annoying and it is not gust this game it‚Äôs all of your goat simulator games please fix it if you can and if you can‚Äôt that‚Äôs fine THANKS!üòÄ  P.S Besides that I love all of your goat simulator games and I have them all!‚ô•Ô∏èüêê"
"8302",969154545,"I have been playing this game for over a year now.  I have finaly reached the top level status and by gaining more than 5k trophies. I was pushing to get up to 6k trophies. I was half way to 6k trophies. Then I noticed I lost over 500 trophies in a 24 hour period. I wrote an email to customer service. It's been 5 days I didn't get a response from the company. Yes, it's a constant grind if you don't want to buy the best weapons. I grinded for over a year to get to the level that I'm at.  It seems like the company is penalizing gamers who don't want to spend money on the platform. Don't play this game. The company cheats you if you don't spend money."
"8303",969154545,"Too boring game,"
"8304",969154545,"I‚Äôm at a point in the game where the only way to advance in the game is to pay.  Where‚Äôs the fun in that!  I tried to play the ‚Äúlong game‚Äù and collect coins, gems, oil but there is never enough time before you‚Äôre raided and lose all that you worked for.  This leaving you with no choice but to PAY to advance.  I‚Äôve accepted this and stopped playing the game altogether.  Which is sad because this game is great fun otherwise."
"8305",969211750,"Problem #1 sometimes when I‚Äôm fighting something or I‚Äôve already killed it it disappears. when I‚Äôm fighting something, and it disappears I‚Äôm stuck in the go forward go backwards   2 when ever the animal control comes to kill me the guy hardly EVER comes so I can just kick the truck around and it just sits there ANND I just saw the truck get stuck outside the fence in the water"
"8306",969211750,"This game is so amazing I love it. Also great for children 8-up love this game"
"8307",969211750,"This game is amazing, now I think there could be some additions, not improvements, but additions. Also there should be multiplayer, that would make this game AMAZING!"
"8308",969247886,"Please make an update so that all of the frozen whales stay where they are after the game is closed out of"
"8309",969247886,"This game is so weird."
"8310",969247886,"I love this game so much it‚Äôs really fun! And everything! I played it in til time limit I love it!"
"8311",969264934,"I can hardly read the tiny text! I agree with other reviews, the game is confusing and the instructions make no sense! Only worth1$ IMO."
"8312",969264934,"Perfect for a train commute. Turn based, challenging, doesn‚Äôt get old. Love it!"
"8313",969264934,"I‚Äôve played hundreds of games for 30 years. I am very picky and most games bore me. This game is great. It can be replayed over and over because you can change the ‚Äútiles‚Äù that the character attacks from."
"8314",969316884,"This review might not matter but, I actually liked this game until I got a new phone and when I downloaded it I was put in a different region, I contacted support and they won‚Äôt recover my account and even with all the information I gave them they won‚Äôt restore it because I didn‚Äôt purchase anything for the game with real money, so 200+ hours down the drain 5- 6 star characters level 60 each and countless 4 and 5 star characters."
"8315",969316884,"I‚Äôd easily rate this game as a zero. Hope you like a game that takes your money and falsely advertises the odds in loot boxes."
"8316",969316884,"This game has a recently revealed article from the senior vp attesting to the shifting of odds. This is a huge loot box game and having learned of the companies practices I advise all to stay away. Though the odds are advertised as one thing, these odds differ from what is stated as well per player. They discriminate against players based on spending. Apple will not do anything against the company so please do not download and stay away from this scam game"
"8317",969447060,"I can practice with fun!!"
"8318",969447060,"At the title said, I seriously can't see the pic behind it."
"8319",969447060,NA
"8320",969447496,"After going through most of the levels and shooting monsters, it really goes nowhere, and had no real drawback for me to come back to the game. Maybe a story, or better settings would provide more entertainment but, after a while a dark broken down hospital doesn‚Äôt want me to keep playing this game. I don‚Äôt even remember how much I paid for this but it wasn‚Äôt worth it."
"8321",969447496,"I have a iPhone XS and played this game on it a few times but lately it will not load the game. I deleted it and installed it again and it just continues to not work"
"8322",969447496,"Amazing game to begin with. More basic content like more facilities to play and different new weapons which isn‚Äôt similar to the others. Also, timed missions or safety missions like guarding someone of something."
"8323",969488951,"To the devs, why did you change up the campaign? It‚Äôs not a MAJOR change but why?"
"8324",969488951,"I love shooting zombies and boss events happening 5 star rate get better then all games"
"8325",969488951,"Next September update"
"8326",969589921,"To many ads I tried to make a cupcake but it made in ad not a fan of ads"
"8327",969589921,"It was a good game for my 5 year old but there was a lot of ads when she was playing the game"
"8328",969589921,"it is an awsome app you have to pay for some things but its a great app however made this l want to thank them"
"8329",969934912,"Its cool, its hard at first but after 20 minutes of playing i finally got it"
"8330",969934912,"I‚Äôve always been a fan of lucky kat studios or whatever cat kat but I had just hit 100 in turbo mode and got the space background and I was so happy and I‚Äôve always wanted nyan cat and I knew it would go perfectly so I went to go buy it for 99 cents and it said that I had purchased it but it still remains locked. So I spent my money on something that I‚Äôm not able to play and I‚Äôm angry that I can‚Äôt play as my favorite cat. I want my cat üò°"
"8331",969934912,"Good game just I can‚Äôt seem to master it still love it though and it eats time while I‚Äôm bored so 5 stars cause this is a really fun game to play when ether I‚Äôm bored or when I‚Äôm around my dog haha"
"8332",969961138,"HoPiko is one of my favorite games. Not only is it super addicting, but the levels are masterfully crafter, the music is top-notch, and the graphics are superb. And, thankfully, thankfully no ads, because ads ruin every game that they touch!"
"8333",969961138,"I don‚Äôt even think it gets too difficult too quickly, but the fact that you have to start from the first round of the level whenever you die is just, not fun. Seriously... I work for a software company, and it would be a quick easy code modification to change that behavior.   It‚Äôs kinda just stupid that they don‚Äôt pay better attention to these reviews."
"8334",969961138,"I‚Äôve played this game for a long time on my 6s and I‚Äôve recently upgraded to the iPhone X every time I try to load the game it goes to the screen where it tells you to play with headphones then goes to a black screen and just stays like that."
"8335",970021572,"My 9 year old and I are very frustrated. We just paid for and downloaded the app, but it crashes when he goes to open the first level. There are no settings or link to contact the developers on the app so I went to the App Store and tried contacting the developer through that, but it sends me to different app site. Can't even get support. Help me fix this or give me my money back!!!"
"8336",970021572,"My son, who is 7, and I had a good time playing this game. The puzzles we‚Äôre only occasionally too challenging for him, and it was a good chance for him to immerse himself in some cool music, and learn a bit about beats beats beats along the way."
"8337",970021572,"I keep coming back every couple of months to this, it's so good. Great music from a great artist & simple but good puzzle routes. Quick way to unwind. üñ§üëåüèª"
"8338",970044095,"Good"
"8339",970044095,"Love how easy and intuitive it is"

"8341",970202342,"One of all time favorite games out there!! So good!"
"8342",970202342,"Purchased the game and then found in game purchases available. Or very very slowly earn crystals. I wanted to like it. But you also have to pay to unlock a new set of decks available. For a free game I understand. But this game wasn‚Äôt free."

"8347",970416885,"How do you use the color changing text"
"8348",970416885,"Free & fun! Update has some new emojis. Yes, it‚Äôs a copy paste app - but it‚Äôs free & fun."
"8349",970416885,"U can not get it in ur keyboard"
"8350",970417047,"The game itself is your basic farming game. With a twist of actually being able to fight enemies in the story. The constant updates keep the game running smoothly. Every now and then we receive free stuff that keeps me coming back. Leveling is a little too slow for my taste. And I hate being able to only upgrade one thing at a time. My biggest complain so far is just the phones and weapons. A week ago or so we received free ‚Äú24 hour full gas‚Äù and I managed to complete over 30 missions, obtaining equipments, food, and experience. All my characters are level 16-17. And I hated the fact that after every missions, most of my weapon rewards were weapons or armor for low levels ranging between 5-8. I believe rewards should match up to your average character level. Even after watching the ad for an extra 3 chests the rewards weren‚Äôt worth it. And my last complain is the phones. As stated above, during the ‚Äú24 hour full gas‚Äù after all those 30 missions I ended up receiving only 2 phones. TWO. it‚Äôs almost impossible to unlock new heroes or upgrade the ones you have because it takes such a long time to even get a high amount of phones. And even then, when you purchase the heroes option 9/10 you don‚Äôt even get hero tokens.  I enjoy the game. But wish they would improve a few things."

"8353",970421850,"I love this game, and even bought the additional levels, which I never do. My only sadness is that there aren‚Äôt more levels!"
"8354",970421850,"This game is very fun. Clever, well designed and challenging in the best possible ways. But the extra 99¬¢ for more levels was shady. The game is worth $2 so just ask for it up front. No volume control either. Design you own would've been great too. Still, I loved paying this."
"8355",970421850,"I would have given this 4 stars, but I'm subtracting a star due to the fact that the game doesn't have iCloud sync support."
"8356",970721313,"Only four stars because it takes forever to get 2500 coins for the slowest shoes and the quests other than the endless one is too short to give you half a heart. And really JUST HALF A HEART THOUGH IT MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER TO SURVIVE THE FIRST TWO QUEST and it increases in difficulty as you go which is good but not helpful. The mystery chest is great though just turn down the level it requires to open one a bit and it would be perfect. Otherwise the game is awesome! Has me coming back every Time! Also it is a bit glitchy and sometimes ignores   my swipes and kills me which can be very frustrating when I'm far in but that rarely happens which makes it a slight bother but that's it. Awesome game in general though with just a few mishaps."
"8357",970721313,"I love this game!"
"8358",970721313,"The game says I could get Jungle Moose at the App Store but it said that the game wasn‚Äôt updated enough. Please either remove the prompt for getting Jungle Moose or update Jungle Moose itself, thank you."
"8359",971215921,"Worked great when I got it.  Since an update about 9 months ago it gets to the loading screen and completely hangs my phone.  Takes 30 sec to get the phone to sleep so I can get to home screen to kill off the process."
"8360",971215921,"I can‚Äôt even get this game to load. Would love to get my money back."
"8361",971215921,"Game will not load. Should have trusted the reviews. Hopefully it will get fixed soon  Update: still doesn‚Äôt work! Ugh"

"8365",971233157,"The Perlini 105F Red tiger truck is listed every day as a daily mission yet this vehicle is not even available in my inventory, even though I have plenty of blueprints of it to build it. Also it is required to finish a level 28 career event.  My other issue is that rank up tools hardly EVER  show up like other tools, so most of my vehicles are stuck at level 25, limiting the events i can play. Given how many of them are needed to rank up, they should put them in boxes more often."
"8366",971233157,"I have been playing this game for a while, I have accumulated a decent amount of cars at pretty high levels, a few weeks ago some my cars were reset back to half their level and customer support has done nothing to help."

"8368",971265422,"Buffers way too much."
"8369",971265422,"$15 a month for an app that wont open is unacceptable"
"8370",971265422,"Whether it be on the app or on your webpage, you guys make it nearly impossible to sign in as a SUBSCRIBER.

"8371",971304016,"It doesn‚Äôt have enough stages, for a paid game you need more!  Other than that it is fun!"
"8372",971304016,"the game is too short for $ 6 they would like to place more stages more adventure in a single day it's over.  not continuously but in a day it seems very short to add more estages"
"8373",971304016,"Every Tombraider fan should play this game. Sure there's simplicity when it comes to the action but the puzzles and locations make up for it. I give this game a 10/10. I was skeptical to try this game but I'm glad I spent the $4.99. So worth it:) One happy customer. I hope there will be more Tombraider games like this in the future."

"8376",971329287,"So well made, unlike most other apps in the category."
"8377",971414822,"This game is great, I would give it 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for some annoying problems. For starters, when I upgrade heroes it often overcharges me. On other occasions I‚Äôll have an upgrade in progress and when I log on a couple of hours later the upgrade never happened."
"8378",971414822,"let me reset my game it‚Äôs a great game and i played a long time ago but i wanna reset"
"8379",971414822,"The game needs more hero‚Äôs and more characters"
"8380",971608996,"I was pleasantly surprised by the graphics in this same as well as the story line and the amount of actual play time. Definitely one of my top games available for purchase in the App Store and definitely worth the 5$ :)"
"8381",971608996,"I saw this game a while back and decided to try it out and I was pleasantly surprised at how (submerged) I got into the game and story, the controls took some getting used to but after a few minutes into the game it‚Äôs just fine. If you ever thought what it would be like to explore a world after a apocalyptic event has happened then you will like this game and it also tells the story of the bonds and lengths a family member will go to in order to survive and help a loved one. And so the game has a little of everything to offer a player. It‚Äôs worth playing."
"8382",971608996,"I loved this game and it would seem that the devs could add a few more chapters. Great graphics and no crashing on iPad 2017."
"8383",971720127,"This is the best vr game I have ever downloaded it‚Äôs also a great leaning game about the brain."

"8385",971720127,"When I got this game I had high expectations. It was much better than I had expected! It is so nice to explore. Though, it would be a tiny bit nice if you could interact more. Other than that, make more of these!"
"8386",971756507,"The game is addictive and challenging but the time does not reset at each checkpoint, which I find annoying because it sets you ALL the way back to square one. So when i get far out, I go right back to where I start. Same with the pinball game too."
"8387",971756507,"I was playing the game until I realized that I was doing a level OVER AGAIN üò¢üò´ I thought it was fun but there‚Äôs like 5 LEVELS  how dumb üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§ üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†üò†üò°üò°üò°üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµ I‚Äôm ANGRY (edit) I read some comets after reading  found out I was wrongüò¢ sorry"
"8388",971756507,"This game has very fun gameplay and everything, is probably give it 10/5 if I could.  HOWEVER! This game does not save your checkpoints unless u pay 3 dollars. So, if u get to a high level and have to leave (ugh, lifeüòí) you will have to start back at the BEGINNING next time. I get that the developers need to get money, but being able to save it should be a liberty for all players to have. Maybe there could be a mode that has turbo, traction control, and sheild All on one car that we have to pay 4. This review will stay low until this major flaw is fixed. However, the game itself is great! (But not when u always restart.)"
"8389",971788369,"This app crashes on opening, shows the GSG logo screen for a split second and then closes itself."
"8390",971788369,"Title says it all. Game was awesome when it came out three years ago, promising new modules to play through. Pretty bummed they never added any. Hopefully they do soon.  Would give it 5 stars but can‚Äôt until it‚Äôs updated."
"8391",971788369,"The game takes a little while to get used to it but once you do it's a great one - reminds me of playing pen-and-paper games 'back in the day'.  The issue is that the dev's have claimed to have additional modules 'coming soon' for a very, very long time... I think I finished the one-and-only module a year ago.  The game is fun - but overpriced in terms of hours of gaming enjoyment if they never deliver on the ""more modules are coming"" promise.   I have to agree w/ another reviewer - if you‚Äôre reading these reviews, wondering if you should purchase... the answer is NO!! It‚Äôs not worth it unless they extend the game."
"8392",972003056,"Tries to sell your kids their other games, in ad during the menu map, and pop up ads after finishing a level. That's a pretty low move I can't condone or support."
"8393",972003056,"We like it! Great art and music - enjoy :)"
"8394",972003056,"I'm 26 and I totally dig this app. Good thing is that my younger siblings find it cool as well."
"8395",972013240,"Love it, but can be habit forming."
"8396",972013240,"Really liked this version out of twenty or so versions I've tried. But how do I order a copy?"
"8397",972013240,"Boo. I don't like the new update!!!!ü§Æ"
"8398",972319818,"The design is beautiful, the strategy is relaxing and mindful. Music is perfect. I love this app and I wish it would go on forever. Please create more levels."
"8399",972319818,"Very pretty but very expensive for how short a game it is. You will probably be through it in under an hour."
"8400",972319818,"This is the most beautiful game I have ever seen. Elegant, haunting, mesmerizing, stylish and addictive. It‚Äôs amazing how a simple and beautiful design, with such a smooth user interface, can create such an amazing experience. While the game is simple, it feels like it echoes life on such a deeper level. Play this game and you will understand, and you‚Äôll admire what‚Äôs been created here. It‚Äôs short and simple, but very rewarding."
"8401",972387337,"It's hard to believe, really. Even after all this time, L&L still cannot improve the Scrivener sync process. The people behind Scrivener are clearly intelligent. One look at the macOS version especially, and it's plain to see the great minds behind the design. Which is why this whole pathetic syncing process baffles me.  Like everyone, I was thrilled to see the iOS version finally released about 3 years ago, even though the UI left a lot to be desired. Still, we could now take our writing on the road, and that was huge. It seemed like a dream come true... until we actually started trying to sync our documents. Holy moly, what a mess! Complaints poured in, and rightfully so. The developers had completely dropped the ball.  It was so bad, I abandoned Scrivener in favor of Ulysses. I set up exactly the same folder structure in Ulysses that I had created in Scrivener, and every single change on either macOS or iOS updated instantly ‚Äî instantly, right before my eyes, without me having to do anything. You can literally hold your iPhone or iPad up beside your MacBook screen, edit a file on either device, and within a couple of seconds, your edits will automatically appear on the other device, even with the projects open! The folks at L&L kept saying their project / folder layout was too complex to make syncing work like that. Obviously that's not true.  So today I decided to update all my devices to the latest version of Scrivener and give it another go. Surely by now all those silly problems would have been resolved. Well, uh, they haven't. The sync process is literally agonizing to watch. First of all, nothing syncs automatically. Seriously?? But even after manually initiating a sync, the nightmare has only begun. You are forced to close the app. Yes, close the app so the project can sync. But the fun doesn't end there. To import your changes onto your other device, you have to, you guessed it ‚Äî close the app on that device, too. What is this, 1998?  Words cannot describe how much I love Scrivener on the Mac, and how much I want to use it as my only source for writing books. But there is no way on God's green earth that I'm going to trust my manuscripts to such an outdated, clunky process!  Not. A. Bloody. Chance!  I guess I'll check back in a year or so and see if Scrivener's syncing process has been dragged out of the dark ages and turned into something that just works without me even having to think about it... like all my other apps already do. But I just noticed that Scrivener on iOS has not been updated in over a year, so I'm not going to hold my breath."
"8402",972387337,"The iPad version does not support iCloud, which makes it pointless to use on this device. The Mac version does but if you want to sync the two you need dropbox. Not worth it."
"8403",972387337,"iPad version makes you choose between saving local on iPad or Dropbox.   1. I use apple iCloud Drive to backup stuff. Easy and free and native to Mac. Why require a 3rd party app? Please add option at least.  2. Offer the ability to export the scrivener file, not just a pdf, etc. I want to be able to save locally on my iPad and hit the sync button and have it backup to folders or Dropbox (whichever I chose). I also would email myself the scrivener file to be safe.   I don‚Äôt want to only save my files in dropbox just in case it crashes when I have an issue. I want A local copy. I do not want to only save on my iPad just in case it is lost or stolen. Please fix or I may switch ASAP."
"8404",972426013,"As a photographer I like having plenty of variety in filters, especially"
"8405",972426013,"I saw this in the sale section of the App Store featuring and figured why not. I've been wanting more options for my pics without having to open photoshop. I was instantly happy with the overwhelming assortment of editable effects. And it's only 1$. You really can't go wrong. Great app, thanks to the developers."
"8406",972426013,"I love this app. It's easy to manage, you get a large amount of filters, manual adjustments and easy to use."
"8407",972627326,"You can‚Äôt even complete a round without watching ads. You‚Äôll kick two field goals, and it says give up now, or watch an ad to continue.... makes the game unplayable, deleting."

The story is interesting and in depth, the places and monsters are interesting, and even after you finish the game, you‚Äôll still have new things to discover. It can literally bring you to tears.

What this game lacks, game developers, is a proper tutorial. Make tutorial missions and objectives which you have to pass first. When I first downloaded the game and finished tutorial, I couldn't play at all and were deciding to delete it. However, now once I got to understand its ""mechanics"" and how to use the ""energy slot"" I got from 50-100 meters to 500 meters in just 10 minutes.   This game has potential, not to mention its visuals.  Very addictive. 11/10"

But, when said players leave the game, which happens quite often, the bots take over and make far more moves than a human possibly could.  The software needs to slow down the moves by the bots to a human level, due to players leaving the game to avoid losing points. Either that or when a player leaves, they lose what‚Äôs in their hand."

"8442",973482525,"I played this game for 3+ years. I mostly enjoyed it, although it irked me that the honeybees are enemies who get in the gardener‚Äôs way, to the point that I sometimes had to remove them. The challenges are a bit repetitive: grow flower until they explode, ‚Äúpick‚Äù bouquets of flowers, destroy weeds; the only interesting part is the changing layout for each level, and dealing with enemies like snails, crows, honeybees, and gophers. About a year into the game, it failed. I don‚Äôt remember if the screen locked up, or what happened, but I had to delete it and reinstall it. All my progress up the map was lost. So I started over. This time I decided to complete each level to three stars before moving on. Some levels took more than a month to complete three stars. I took great satisfaction in reviewing my unbroken streak of three stars across the map, up to Level 269. Then, last week the map disappeared. I sent a ticket to support. I got a canned response. Following the instructions on the response, I created a user account and searched the discussions on the King Community boards. Sure enough, there was a thread on missing maps, with a screenshot identical to my game view. Dated 10 months ago, in December 2018. Several posts from January and February showed that the problem was never even acknowledged, let alone addressed. So I sent a second email to support. Got the same canned response as before. Losing the map drops my interest in the game to zero. The lack of support makes me question any investment of time in a King game. I have deleted Blossom Blast Saga and will not be back."
"8443",973482987,"This game is pretty good, and it takes a little luck and it is very easy to control the screen, so I‚Äôm giving this a five star"

I'm also not sure how I'd go about adding a location/copyright/watermark either, if I was interested in the other ""features"" of this app.   Either this is a trainwreck of a UI, or they advertise functionality that doesn't exist.

I have paid version but because it's a pretty simple and cool tool its worth buying and I support your effort, but it crashes and going from auto to manual mix, wave file view doesn't reset to cue songs.

"8544",978524071,"This is one of my favorite games, but this is a bad port.  First and foremost, the game has multiple times saved on a black screen with music and no graphics.  Your game is borked when this happens.  Ypu have to start from the beginning.  Also, the touch controls are not well suited for the game."
"8545",978563657,"Play icon doesn‚Äôt toggle. Erase button doesn‚Äôt. Stops playing every time I touch the piano roll even though I‚Äôm just trying to move the screen. Looked like a good idea. Just not done well to my way of thinking."
"8546",978563657,"I was hoping to find something to edit midi on at an affordable price, and I was disappointed to be unable to import music. Please add this."
"8547",978563657,"Updated update: *still* a cool idea. Dark UI theme is very much appreciated, as are standard iOS gestures for drawing and zooming. Now: copy/paste? Please? It is the one missing function that keeps me from using this app more than once every few months.   Update: MIDI export: yay! All the other stuff: still want, especially copy/paste, dark UI, and regular iOS scrolling and drawing gestures. Also, there seems to be an annoying lag with the current two-finger drawing: I lift my left thumb but if I try to scroll too quickly with my right, I end up with a stack of notes that have to be erased.    Thanks for listening to your users!  ---  I'm giving this app four stars because I like the idea so much and because even though it is missing some fairly basic functionality it is already extremely flexible in the variety of musical ideas you can take down. I was not even sure anyone had made a simple piano roll music editing app when I went looking for one, but here it is, brand new!  So it is a piano roll-style music writing app that comes without a hugely complex DAW attached to it. It can be used for microtonal work at a fairly rough resolution: if you turn off the snap-to-pitch option, it will let you draw notes anywhere between (Western even-tempered 12-tone) pitches that you would like. It is equally flexible with regard to meter: snap-to-time can be turned on or off, and although the roll itself has grid lines for regular measures, you can ignore them entirely.  Without the snap-to functions, you can sketch melody lines freely, but there is little precision if you want to be able to create tones at precise frequencies that are not on the even-tempered scale. I have not been able to find any additional preferences to changes scales for the snap-to values. And so this truly is a sketchpad if precision is important to your music but you are trying to work outside of modern even-tempered Western music.  My main problems with this app are that very basic digital tools are missing. There is no copy/paste on the sketchpad itself, so repeating structures can take some time to fill in. There is no export of any kind: no audio files, not even an image file of the sketch itself. A dark background app theme would be very helpful for those of us who find glaring white backgrounds painful--or even just annoying--to work with.   This app has a lot of potential. Honestly, I could see it becoming into a synth/sampler that created audio stream output. MIDI would be gravy, if challenging to implement.  At the least, my wishes for added options would be something like the following:  Improved editing: copy/paste; the ability to draw straight lines from one arbitrary point to another rather than being restricted to snap-to-pitch; and making the non-standard two finger drawing/zoom function optional while adding the usual iOS gestures for these functions--myself, I find those gestures adequate and those implemented here to be awkward.   Import user samples for custom instruments.  Export and/or record audio into aiff or wav format.  A sine oscillator as one instrument choice--this would give the app and the user some basic synthesizing power.  Audiobus integration that would allow further processing of the audio output.  Great start. Add more stuff! :)"

"8606",980241548,"I am kind of surprised at how many good people are being thrown around in this game. I don‚Äôt like how Police officers, Sheriffs, Firefighters, etc, are being tossed around. It started to bother me when every time I would win a new character, it would most likely be one of those three and I do not think that is acceptable. This is not my favorite game."
"8607",980241548,"I HATE DIS GAM"

"8610",980274086,"First of all, this is an INCREDIBLE game. I HIGHLY recommend it. My only complaint is that it gets a bit repetitive at times. For example, smaller enemies would just keep showing up and interrupting the story. I liked the smaller enemies, but I didn‚Äôt like having to constantly avoid them while I was trying to enjoy the story. Other than that, no complaints. Good graphics, great story, great actors, and genuinely creepy as opposed to a lot of modern horror which is just jump scares and gore. This game does have those, but it also has a disturbing story and a really creepy atmosphere."
"8611",980286865,"I want to amend my previous review. It works fine. And shows the scene. Still an amazing and one of my favorites."
"8612",980286865,"Finally a role playing game that‚Äôs not medieval swords and shields. Great storyline, excellently creepy setting, art and sfx."
"8613",980286865,"Will you guys please make a sequel to one of my favorite games please! It has been almost five years and we still don‚Äôt know what happens to Erica next. So I, and I think hundreds of other people would really appreciate it if you would go and make a sequel to the game. Thank you for making TIL Mornings Light by the way!"
"8614",980307863,"I would absolutely love to give this game 5 stars because I had a great time playing but Im giving it 1 because there is a major glitch, you get stuck in the cavern with no way to call the elevator down and the only other level you can get to is also screwed up with no way out. Sadly Im seeing a lot of these same complaints and it has yet to be fixed so don‚Äôt waste your money. If they fixed this issue I would say it‚Äôs absolutely worth the money but seems they don‚Äôt have the time or seem to care to fix it."
"8615",980307863,"It said it was compatible with my iPhone yet when I try to play it the logo is covering up the button so I can‚Äôt play it. I paid $4 and cant play it. Please fix the issue!"
"8616",980307863,"The enemies are invisible. I have to aim at their guns which are really hard to see. Also, about 90% of the background characters you can interact are invisible too."
"8617",980368562,"I have used this app to cook recipes worth talking about. Great for introducing cooking to other people. Makes people think your healthy and the recipes on here are like for vegan included and all types of diets. He has recipes from lots of countries. My favorite is Mexican I think he captures the Mexican ingredients perfectly for his recipes. Great app and I know I‚Äôm set for all his future concoctions. Love you man your a genius."
"8618",980368562,"The recipes look great. But there is no way to print out the recipes ingredients and directions. The only work around I have figured is to screenshot and print those. But it‚Äôs inefficient and annoying process for s cooking app. Very disappointed."

"8624",980540474,"This is a terribly designed shmup. Unlike other, better made bullet hell games, this game FPGAs way too much going on at once. Thimgs constantly pop onto the screen and shoot an insane amount of bullets at once.  The first boss has a laser attack that gives no warning, and will almost always hit you because you need to be right in front of it to actually hit it with your weapon.  Avoid this one. Go buy dodonpachi or something instead."
"8625",980540474,"Great shmup with high octane action right from the start. Seems impossible at first, but as you learn to do small, precise dodges and use your specials and bombs often and wisely it gets really fun. I have a few specific gripes about individual moments (boss 4's ""fake"" bullets come to mind) but overall this game is a blast. The soundtrack is awesome too, and the game includes a music player with unlockable tracks."

"8638",981437721,"If I could give it 0 I would. Literally could not make a single baby without being forced into a trial. A 3 day trial then becomes $7.99 per WEEK.

"8639",981437721,"If I could give a zero star rating I would! Downloaded the app for my niece to play around with and canceled the subscription to the FREE TRIAL 24 hours before it was set to renew (as the app said to do) but was still charged $8.50 for a subscription I CANCELED!!!"
"8640",981437721,"It does nothing unless you purchase it. So please mark it as a paid one not a free app"
"8641",981535263,"Warning: this game has advertisements. Other annoying things about this app is the unavoidable and redundant score screen that you have to wait like 20 seconds to continue.

Its like worms 100 years in the past without all the features."

"8657",982175678,"I really wanted to like this game but it is unplayable due to constant crashing. Tech support initially responded once to recommend basic fixes (clean boot, closing all other apps) which I had already tried. It‚Äôs been over 6 weeks since I requested support. I got one response saying they might be a little busy. Now they just ignore requests for help. $15 wasted."
"8658",982175678,"This game I gave a 5 star review in the past, but the new updates messed with the coding it seems. During the sniper junction event, there is little to no audio clue in which the sniper is shooting, making it extremely difficult to complete the mission without dying. The visual clues are there though (bullets hitting the ground). When in combat with firearms, you can‚Äôt hear the shots being fired. This bothers me a lot because it breaks the immersion to the point where there is no point in immersing the player. I know I‚Äôm asking much, but please fix these issues. But, in the end, this war of mine is a great game full of immersive experiences, and requires tough decisions and smart decisions as well."

Says there‚Äôs no cloud sync data, no purchases were restored and NO saved games were present. Literally had unlocked every plane and it goes back to the drawing board. Pitiful excuse for a simulator. It needs serious updates. Do not waste your time or money. As of this writing the game has not been update since approximately April 2018."

"8667",982255287,"Good puzzles for anyone"
"8668",982354972,"Cool back & forth narrative between you and your protagonist. Makes you wait for them in real-time, but I felt this intensified the process. Reminds me of those choose your own adventure books, but as I said, more immersive. Would recommend those who enjoy a good sci-fi thriller. I see they offered a bunch of add-on. Probably wouldn‚Äôt pay money, but it‚Äôs entertaining."

"8670",982354972,"‚Ä¶it is so freaking boring.  UPDATE: I just monitored the time I had to wait for Taylor to stop being ‚Äúbusy‚Äú and come back to the game. I waited 2.35 hours for him/her to return and then I got 1.6 seconds of dialogue before he/she left and the game went dormant again. How uninspired and boring could these developers, themselves, possibly be to think such a game would be interesting? Deleting the game now. Also made a mental note of this developer so as to never purchase from it again.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: I see how the idea of a real-time game would seem clever, but in real time when somebody sleeps, what are you going to do, sit there for hours and watch? That is all there is to do in this game while it says ‚ÄúTaylor is busy‚Äú? It is just SO incredibly slow because you progress in, maybe, two-second intervals between Taylor being busy doing something and going away. So, for hours he/she is off doing something then comes back and you get, maybe, two seconds of dialogue and then he/she is off again. Boring, boring, boring. Too bad. I wanted to like this game."

I opted to use an MFi controller, so I can attest that it is very well implemented and makes the game a delight to play. I am also playing on an iPad Pro, so I can attest to the fact that the game looks and sounds good on a larger screen.  I can't recall how I came across it, but am glad I did. It's a steal at a dollar with no ads or IAPs. Blessings to the developer for a delightful little adventure."

It helps me feel like I‚Äôm making progress even if I‚Äôm not perfect. Each task has its own ‚Äústreak‚Äù as well as the whole day can be a streak if you do ALL of your tasks. I‚Äôve finally accomplished things like- regular flossing, saying daily affirmations , and improving the quality of food I consume with this app. If you‚Äôre even thinking you may want help getting ‚Äúself-care‚Äù or basic ‚Äúoh I need to remember to water my plants 4 days a week,‚Äù just download it and start keeping plants alive!!!"

It lags like crazy if there are even just a few enemies on the screen at one time."

"8713",984394908,"A while back Gameloft (notoriously greedy) did the most generous thing they have ever done -- they removed the Vigor limit. This allows players to gain as much experience as they want, and play whenever they want. This seems to be the only game that Gameloft truly cares about. There are no forced or necessary micro transactions. Spending money in the game will only allow you to advance faster or receive cosmetic items. You can obtain almost everything in the game by simply playing it, although it will take a bit longer. This is the most carefully and perfectly designed MMO that you will EVER find on the App Store. You can easily tell a lot of work went into developing this game. Fans of MMO games should download this game immediately."

It is difficult and requires thought and problem solving abilities and finger dexterity, but it is never frustrating or unfair.  This game is totally worth 3 bucks.

Next to the hundreds of challenges in One More Jump, the nuanced gameplay of One More Bounce or even the novel sling mechanic of One More Line, One More Dash is the simplest: tap to jump from circle to circle, but time each move to avoid the colored barriers travelling around each target. That's it.  Still, the various unlockable color schemes are amazing...clearly made by smart visual designers who know what they're doing. I love toggling the different color schemes depending on my mood, the time of day, etc. Really sharp.  The music is also pitch-perfect. Gets your heart pounding without being distracting.  Ultimately, this is pretty much the perfect game for 2- to 5-minute bursts. Just don't expect terribly deep gameplay."

"8776",987962261,"Used to be a great app with lots of amazing demos (that was over a year ago). Now it just crashes and has like six demos. Don‚Äôt waste your time.  Google - Reset app to the original! Then it would be a definite five-star review."
"8777",987962261,"Upgraded my phone to an XS and the app won‚Äôt launch any more. Tried reinstalling. Please update. My kids and I love this app!"
"8778",987962261,"Rebooted phone, reinstalled the app several times, attempt after attempt and still can‚Äôt even get the thing to open cardboard demo.  Useless to me.   Other VR apps such as YouTube work perfectly on my XS."

Please fix this because i edit all of my pictures with this app."

I have a suggestion for your players like myself who have played for a long time. During your events new players can earn the rare Kongs like the pumpkin and bunny etc and after we have already earned it from a previous year all we win is coins. Maybe you could do a different version of that kong or perhaps different colored pumpkins each year so we can still earn new Kongs too! I already have all the kongs and most of the accessories for them so it would be cool to still have goals and more accessories to try and get!   Thanks for creating a great game though!!"

"8818",989178902,"Timepage provides an incredibly useful feature that can not be found in the native Apple Calendar app, and that‚Äôs the ability to show every ‚Äúall-day‚Äù event when the number of events on a single day is greater than 4.  In Calendar, all day events appear in the top grey bar when in day view, but only the first 4 appear fully. All day events 5 & 6 are cutoff and anything beyond that is difficult to see at a glance. So if you are active with multiple events to juggle, Timepage will be incredibly useful.  The reason why I can‚Äôt rate it higher is because I do not like the subscription model. I‚Äôve been using this for years and have been grandfathered in (for now) but subscription after subscription just becomes very expensive once you add them ALL up.  I fully like the idea of supporting great developers and their useful products but I hope they share the same concern that ALL of our subscription when added together are becoming too expensive to justify, making the subscription model one that will eventually need to fail."
"8819",989178902,"Please bring back previous interface! Is way too cumbersome now to set appointments and used to be easy! Never fix what‚Äôs not broken!"
"8820",989178902,"This is a pretty, well designed app. I used it through the Free Trial period and liked it, along with the Actions app. I like the way they are integrated.  The reason I‚Äôm not inclined to subscribe is 1) While your subscription price is not unreasonable, I but don‚Äôt appreciate apps that require you to subscribe the keep using them. I‚Äôm much more likely to buy something outright. 2) more importantly, you do not offer an integrated calendar app for Android. I downloaded the Actions app on my Android phone, but was disappointed not to find the Timepage app there. I haven‚Äôt decided to uninstall the apps yet, but I probably will so."
"8821",989254177,"This app is simply amazing! It has helped me sleep better."

If I accidentally muted the ringer sometimes the phones built in alarm is also silent, which obviously is counterproductive. Goodmorning never lets me down and rings with the same volume every morning.   Feature req: can we have more variety with the rings? I‚Äôd love to have a dozen or a few dozen more rings. I‚Äôm not docking my rating because of the paucity of rings; a half dozen seems fair. I‚Äôve been using this for a while and just think that more variety would be awesome."
"8823",989254177,"Downloaded this under the false pretenses that you could choose a playlist to wake up to. What it really means is that you can ‚Äúload‚Äù a playlist into the interface, and choose a single song from it, which it will play 45 seconds of before snoozing itself.  The interface moves as a glacial pace, often requiring several taps before responding.  And now I‚Äôve gone consecutive nights without any of my sleep data registering- literally the only reason I‚Äôm still using this.  Add to that the fact that the company is entirely unresponsive to these issues, I don‚Äôt feel even slightly confident of these crooks responding to my request for a refund."

Serves its purpose. I Seem to have a problem in terms of texts and calls being inaudible as they come thru in real timeBesides I absolutely love iPlum service. The price is right and allows me to keep my personal number private. This effin rocks,, the developers have done an excellent job of providing a service for business that allows for multi regional support iPlum could do with a bit of Canada, US.Finally It is a great app as you can have a second number without having another SIM card I would recommend you to anyone who is looking for another number only one downfall would be great. I think this ap is great. If you want to call/text without the other party knowing, this is definitely the app you are looking for."

"8845",990668324,"Formulas and Stackables are my favorite filter apps. They can make all the difference in bringing out the nuance, mood and beauty of an image. I use these filters for the majority of my creations, and I, like so many other creatives, have been very, very sad and disappointed that Stackables is no longer being updated and available on the App Store, and that Formulas may follow. There have been many discussions in the mobile photography and art groups on Facebook regarding this as the apps are so widely used and loved. Every teacher of mobile art and photography I know, hundreds of artists, books regarding the subject, and numerous articles, have mentioned and recommended Stackables. With the continued influx of artists in this growing genre of mobile art and photography, both Stackables and Formulas would continue to grow in popularity. I‚Äôve been wondering, can another developer not acquire Stackables and continue to develop it and keep it available? And why is it not worth continuing to develop? These apps are so much a part of my creative output, I‚Äôve even considered no longer downloading IOS updates on my devices in order to insure I can continue to use them!"
"8846",990668324,"Gorgeous filters. Gives my images that special pizzazz that I haven‚Äôt been able to get from other filter apps.

"8851",990928352,"I love this app. I can‚Äôt remember if it costed a couple dollars but it‚Äôs worth it (I‚Äôve used it for sooo long). It‚Äôs easy to understand and fun to play around with. I use it for my instagram pictures. You can blur and decolor areas to make cool effects and focus points."

This trumps Pok√©mon GO 20 times over, the character design makes Arika feel like she‚Äôs an actual person (as lifeline games tend to do) and the fantasy approach really helped me enjoy this even more, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I played Lifeline and Silent Night before Bloodline, but goddamnit if this isn‚Äôt the best the series has to offer to me as of yet.  If you haven‚Äôt already downloaded this, I HIGHLY recommend it, they even added fast mode to make sure you don‚Äôt have to wait as long, have fun, and make the correct decisions"
"8864",991357716,"My favorite Lifeline game in the series, it combines everything I love about the games into one masterpiece"
"8865",991357716,"I played the first Lifeline and was so impressed with the storyline I gave Lifeline 2 a go but like many sequels, it doesn‚Äôt come close to its predecessor. The premise sounds good but the conversations are boring and the humor is forced. The logic is flawed and there were several instances where you suggest a course of action and she either just doesn‚Äôt follow your suggestion or it‚Äôs just too plain to see that the game wants you to go in a particular direction. I wish I could get my money back but I bought it and didn‚Äôt get to play for a couple of weeks so the time to refund passed. What a waste."
"8866",991558368,"This app is the best thing you could see , it‚Äôs still good but it moves a lot so you have to stay calm ! I rate it 5"

"8869",991563953,"Once you get to the higher levels, part of the puzzles appear off screen, and you can‚Äôt pan or zoom to see them. So essentially you have to guess. If you can even swipe the tiles."
"8870",991563953,"The game hasn‚Äôt been updated for the max sizes, so you can‚Äôt see the sides of the board. So once you get to about level 24 or so, there‚Äôs no way to win."
"8871",991563953,"This is a great puzzle game. I really enjoy challenging myself to avoid sets of 3.  One note, sometimes on my XS, the tiles shift so they're wider than the phone screen and I can barely touch them. Definitely can't see them, and am blind guessing if they are 1 or2 dots.  Great game otherwise."

"8875",991709209,"Ok, so first of all. This is a really good game. But I have an issue with the chats ending, even when I paid for them. Please update Jeff Kasser!!! He‚Äôs my favorite!! üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ"
"8876",991709209,"So I played this in the chat for Andy but my one problem is, is that the game is called boyfriend but pretty much as soon as you become boyfriend and girlfriend it ends. So honestly I wish it went in further. (It would also be awesome if these guys were real, especially Andy, but that‚Äôs not in their hands and we all know they aren‚Äôt so I can handle that lol) I really, really enjoyed this game and how realistic everything is! It was lots of fun to allow myself to be pulled into the experience and just pretend it was real for a few moments at a time haha."

"8878",991764216,"OK, so here‚Äôs the deal. I use this just like those old ‚Äúocean wave‚Äù toys. (The ones that came in a plastic tube, and were filled with a thick blue liquid and a clear liquid. You tilted them from one end of the tube to the other to make ‚Äúwaves‚Äù.) With this app, i don‚Äôt close my eyes, and I pay no attention to the ‚Äútoo fast‚Äù or ‚Äútoo slow‚Äù because I don‚Äôt care what the developer had in mind, I just want to play with the colors. It does fill the screen, but, if you move around toward the corners you will see that the circle is still there. Then you can start playing with it, making it bigger and smaller, and moving around. It‚Äôs a not perfect app. I‚Äôd like a little more control of the size of the circle, and the colors, but I enjoyed it."
"8879",991764216,"Wished it supported fullscreen for iPhone X‚Äôs visuals. Seeing a tiny screen disrupts the experience. Also, I wish it had the ability to keep sound effects, but mute music so I could listen to my own (vibrating would also help at the end)."

You guys should also start people off for free with some gold about 200 gold; because I know from my experience that gold is pretty hard to get if you can‚Äôt buy it especially with ten year olds like me who don‚Äôt have a credit card or gift cards on a iPad or a phone.

"8932",993160329,"Junk software from crappy company. It literally never worked correctly. Then they made a massive public relations error by stealing from their customers. The app held steady at 3.2 stars because it didn't work before the subscription fiasco. Then decided to charge customers of a paid app, now it has a solid 2.0 star review average. Yep, keep looking. This app will die, they can't possibly recover their reputation or even fix this pile of junk."
"8933",993160329,"So I tried this app again since they gave notifications back to their faithful customers. Gee what a nice gesture. The app still performs poorly.  Messages don't get moved to trash when deleting from Apple watch, when you block a sender for some stupid reason it goes into archive and there is absolutely no way to unblock that sender. You try sending the message back to inbox and it comes right back to archive. What a pathetic, horrible app  This app functions poorly, has devs that continually screw loyal paid customers and constantly have people post fake reviews. Like the one down there üëá  Another paid fake review right there üëáPathetic app   So according to the review from PeppernGypsy down there üëáüèº you‚Äôre paying a premium to talk to Steven and chat about the crap he screwed up in the first place. Some people are just too stupid   This is horrible run by incompetent people. YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN WARNED! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THEY WILL SCREW YOU IN THE LONG RUN.  JUST READ ALL THE 1 STAR REVIEWS   Another paid FAKE review right down there üëáüèº  It‚Äôs like Jerry‚Äôs Kids are running this app. Can‚Äôt make up the incompetence.   Keep rolling out fake updates weekly to distract from all the negative one star reviews. Pathetic   See below for some fake positive reviews. üëá  As for the app, it was never great, always had bugs, never formatted emails properly and notifications were hit or miss. So what do they do, screw their longtime customers with no grandfathered period and continue to make the app worse and worse. And please devs stop having people post fake positive reviews as no one likes your business practices and certainly no one likes your app."
"8934",993160329,"ridiculous, I paid for the app a few years ago and I paid for both, mac and ios versions, I was loyal and I loved your app, and then you just opened it for free download and integrated that freaking subscription model with no benefits for those who paid for the app already! it‚Äôs rude, guys.."
"8935",993187907,"Don't waste your time on this ""game"" it's more or less just something you download and it just spits an ad at you every 2 seconds."

"8937",993187907,"There is no tutorial and an ad after almost every single game. I could not figure out how to play at all. So frustrating"
"8938",993290127,"This has to be one of my favorite mobile games. The graphics are great and the gameplay is addicting. However it‚Äôs extremely difficult to get any higher level units without in app purchases which kind of stinks. I also think that it should be easier to obtain blueprints for higher level units since it takes so many to craft them. The thing that bugs me most is the time limit on battles. It gets extremely frustrating when you‚Äôre about to destroy someone and the battle times out. I just played a raid and I had the gut within my grasp and it timed out and I lost. If you can‚Äôt take away the time limit please make the scoring system different. Like the player with more base hp wins or something of that sort. Otherwise this is an amazing game. If it sounds like I‚Äôm ranting, sorry just voicing my opinion."

"8942",993435362,"Maybe I missed something in the description before I wasted my money? I got this so I could check wikis on my Watch, while I‚Äôm out and about. This product said it had a Watch version.  You know what the Watch version does? It tells you to go check the article on your iPhone.  Now that is one stupid Watch app, and I feel stupid for having bought it."
"8943",993435362,"Great app. I especially enjoy the map feature. I do wish there were more customizable settings for font. At minimum, a toggle to switch between serif and sans-serif for the main text would be so greatly appreciated, as it would make things easier to read for those who prefer sans-serif."
"8944",993492744,"Great way to pass time and have some fun overall great game wouldve given it 10/10 if i couldve"
"8945",993492744,"I love the ever changing farms and the challenge of the different levels, however the major problem I have with the game is the videos you watch to earn things. The videos of late haven‚Äôt worked. All they do is lock up the game to a blank screen causing you to have to reboot your phone. You lose out on the free award plus time away from any boost you may be using. Fix this and I‚Äôll give it 5 stars."
"8946",993492744,"Awesome game"
"8947",993570169,"Super fun to play! Love this game. But, ads pop up in the middle of the game! I‚Äôm talking, big, full page ads that you have to close out. I can‚Äôt get very far in the game without being forced to fall from ads :("

"8953",994556645,"The reason I gave you three stars is because I can‚Äôt get in the app after writing down the parent name I pressed next and it said ‚Äúoh no!

Nobody could help us get our app open. Sad part is my kiddo really loved it. I believe I paid like over $60 for this and we couldn‚Äôt use it. And then they want you to ask apple for a refund. And apple redirects you to the curious world customer service. Never got to enjoy this app and I never received a refund either. Very disappointed."

"8974",995022521,"Great app. Only concerns are that the letter p and the letter f is facing the wrong direction. If you could fix that more people in the deaf community would likely purchase the app. Also if you could allow us to change the background color that would really help balance the different colors you have for the letters."
"8975",995022521,"So I can see the handshapes clearly in the app store screen shots. That's not at all what you see when you use the keyboard on the phone. The handshapes are so tiny you can't make them out. For the letters, you can switch to Roman letters to see where the handshape is that you want. However, this only works for letters. The other two banks of features - number handshapes through 29 or maybe 30, I honestly can't tell - as well as some simple signs like YES, NO, THAT etc, unless you can pull this up on an iPad, I don't know how you'd be able to know what they are except by trial and error. Too bad. I'd like to use this but it's not useable on a phone, which is where I'd get the most use out of it."
"8976",995022521,"I agree with what I read from a previous reviewer. I really like this keyboard, the features, and the way it is laid out. I am very excited to use this as a tool to learn ASL. My only issue is that the individual signs are very small in the keyboard itself and are hard to make out, especially to my novice eye.  I hope you can fix this issue soon, and if/when you do, I will be happy to write another review!"
"8977",995112030,"Sure wish this app would tell me when my credit card due date is. Other than that, it‚Äôs useful"
"8978",995112030,"I downloaded this app in order to make mobile deposits. It looks like it works just like my other bank, bu after 30 minutes of trying, I gave up.

"8993",996246479,"Every time I use this app on my television, I have to log in. It‚Äôs pretty annoying that I could be watching something and I‚Äôll hit pause or rewind and it kicks me off and I have to sign in again. Literally, every single time."
"8994",996246479,"Showtime has lots of great selection however this app has to be as non user friendly as possible. no ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù or ‚Äúskip intro‚Äù feature. it doesn‚Äôt even show you the episodes you‚Äôve watched of a show when scrolling through the thumbnail screen. if you like having to spend 5 minutes waiting for the app to get past the initial opening screen, search for the show you want bc it definetly will not have it there to be easily accessed like any other media app, then this is the app for you."

"8998",996491151,"I've played Puzzel Strike off and on for a couple of years.   I have the board game version, and I used to play the Free Web Version while I was on my walking treadmill.  This iOS implementation is very polished.  I was a little worried after readinng the negitive reviews, but I went forward with a buddy and we both bought a copy.  It played smooth as single player (and the puzzle mode is nice), and today we tried it multiplayer.   At first we could not get a custom game started (we'd pick the characters but could not start it or edit the bank), so I posted on the Forum on their website, and within 5 mins (9pm cst) there was a reply from the admin stating the Server was in a ""bad state"" for iOS and he'd reboot it.   Well he did, and my friend and I did about 4 hours of stable play across the internet (while running Facetime).  Super solid implementation - though with hiccups and growing pains."
"8999",996491151,"Messages that display programmer info (like an empty object showing as ""{0}"")' no Undo for many actions, and a Custom game mode that doesn't let you choose your bank or start the game. This feels like a Single Player beta. It is in no way finished and doesn't merit the $4 price tag. Keep your money until Sirlin gets their act together."
"9000",996491151,"As mentioned by others, the create account system just doesn't work. And there's no way to contact the developers to alert them to the problem. Which means I won't be spending the $12(!!!!) to unlock the rest of he game. Which, by the way, feels a bit exorbitant for an app that doesn't support pass and play, and since I can't log in, means I can't play with my friends at all. See, if you do the math, $12 * 4 means that you and your friends will pay $48 to play the full game against each other. That's more than the cost of the actual board game."

"9010",996948313,"This game has an amazing story and excellent graphics."
"9011",996948313,"So far so good. The graphics are really nice. The story is good. Overall the mechanics are good. The controls are great (with a nimbus controller) Nothing really groundbreaking or original, but it‚Äôs a very solid game. A bit of stealth/action/adventure.   The sound is pretty bad at most times, with volume levels being wildly uneven, and lackluster, repetitive sound effects. The voice acting is pretty bad for some characters but Eisenhorn and most of the main characters are good. While the character models are beautifully rendered for the main characters, the standard for enemies and others is noticeably lower.The animations for everyone are very jerky, and usually too fast, making it hard to see exactly what happens. All this aside, I still love the game and it‚Äôs totally worth the money."
"9012",996948313,"I bought the game but it wouldn‚Äôt even load in"
"9013",997002798,"Fun! The kids and I love it! And it‚Äôs available on the Apple TV‚Ä¶ wish more quality games were.   Question for game devs: is there any visual indication on screen that lets me know if I have any boost ready to go?"
"9014",997002798,"Edit: Working on Apple TV 4K! After sending a video of the problem to show their support the issue, they seem to have fixed the issue. We tried the game last night and it worked! The kids can‚Äôt be happier. Thank you! This is a great game on the Apple TV 4K.   Only one request, support more players for the split screen view or allow a split-screen with multiplayer WiFi.  Original: After purchasing the game for my kids, sadly they were disappointed. The game loads with a view of winding around a track backwards with a red triangle in the middle. You can select to start the game and then nothing happens. Their support was quick to get in touch with me to help resolve the problem. Hopefully we can be playing the game soon. Please fix as I would love to update my review."
"9015",997002798,"Crashes and crashes. Will not even load the first race. The game loads but crashes during load-up of first race. I turned off all other apps and restarted my Ipad. Same result. Refund plez."
"9016",997362197,"Hi! I'm Instagram @stfambb! I just wanted to say that I honestly use this app for edits! Memes, video edits, and collages! This is my main edit app, and it's so so useful for so many things! I'd love it if I could have more transitions without the pro version, but I mean, I can't complain because I sort is so easy to use and it can get you really nice edits! If you could add anything for the free version, I'd suggest maybe adding more transitions? That's literally all! That's all its missing from what I imagine as a perfect app!"
"9017",997362197,"I absolutely love the app, for edits and just in general. The one problem I did I have with it was I was a little confused on which buttons did what. Also, the picture count you can only use 9. Other then that, I can‚Äôt find a better app. The one the offers me more exclusive content."
"9018",997362197,"InShot is truly great. I have had many editors, but none of them work as well as this one. I did buy a couple of things, but they still have a lot for free."
"9019",997446291,"Ok. My highest ghost combo is 35. But I was on Championship II and it said I was on level Highway But the stuff was like blue and it had some stuff from Half and Dungeon and Spiral.

"9020",997446291,"This app has many awesome features that you (and some people like me) can use in the game 1. Clearing pellets for food, fruits, vegetables, and other stuff: If PAC-MAN gets all the pellets on one side there is a special Item that will sparkle when it appears the item only clears one side.2. Green sleeping ghosts and power  pellet chain: if PAC-MAN goes near a green ghost it will get ANGRY AND PURSUE PAC-MAN if PAC-MAN goes near more they will follow their leader the leader is the one in front If PAC-MAN gets a power pellet he can eat them the more he eats the more the score goes up and the speed goes up.My favorite part is the free üîê because you can get the PAC-MAN dreams of your life."
"9021",997446291,"I love this game. I love the classic feel of the game with the updated features. The only rub though is the fact that the game is sooooo easy to swipe away while trying to control the game and this always seems to happen when you are in the heat of the battle to stay alive or munch some ghost.

"9026",997878440,"I love this game but I was going to see if I could make a suggestion while the sea buddies are amazing how about after that you continue on to a story arc where maybe aliens invade Townsville and could you try adding in bliss I love the fourth  Power puff girl and I‚Äôd love to see her in action also adding in her powers amongst the other three would make this game awesome would you guys consider my suggestion thank you"
"9027",997878440,"Can you please get rid of the notes because I get so many notes that it's now the worst thing ever on the app like I still love the app and I wish it would help me and many other people so when I got all the stickers I had a more rare chance to getting a sticker and I more common chance for me to get a sticker but keep it up you guys are my favorite people since you made the app so please stop having the notes and I'll give you a good comment please don't go flipping out and update the app again üëç"

"9033",998179061,"1. fix how easy the ppl die. I hit someone literally twice and they fell over and it was over for them.  Maybe instead of dying they can just get knocked out and get back up later? And it brings your mental health down wayyy too much. I mean i know you just killed someone but geesh 2.  add weapons like AKs and pistols but make them hard to obtain (not just laying around in random areas). Maybe buy them at the warehouse  3.  being able to actually teach an assigned classroom as a teacher. This could be done by walking up to a student, pressing the ‚ÄúT‚Äù button, and choose from a list of questions to ask. But you would be able to determine if its right or wrong. Could be hard to implement but I just dont wanna have to use my imagination walking around the classroom with nothing to do.  4. Also the popularity thing is really annoying. Maybe change it to percentages instead of grades? (Like in supercity). I got kicked once and my popularity dropped from a ‚ÄúB‚Äù to a ‚ÄúC‚Äù 5. when you become a civilian, you should be able to have kids and raise them in school as parents, sorta like in your other games when you make out with someone and a kid pops up. This could make it more like a life-sim game.  6. Make 2 handed controls an option  7. Add groups (jocks, nerds, preppy, emo, etc.) similar to the gangs in hard time, where you can join them but would have to meet certain requirements. For jocks you would need a strength of at least 90% or ‚ÄúA‚Äù .. for nerds you would need at least A- in every subject.. ya get the idea.  I know this is a lot to ask for but it would make the game that much better. just a couple tweaks and it could be a perfect game."

"9060",999702563,"I never got the DS-10 plus, but played around with the vanilla DS-10 quite a bit. This app is a pretty nice leap from the original! Approaching this review from my perspective:  Ability to set a pattern length to up to 64 beats is very nice.   Being able to apply an effect per track is great too  Also way less menu swapping here - all the synth stuff (patching, effects, etc) are all on one screen  Way better controls for copying/pasting patterns too. Being able to paste a single track instead of the entire pattern is very convenient   Being able to record changes to an individual knob is very powerful too. I'll admit that this feature could be much easier to use though.   Very cool voice synth too!   This is a must buy from me :)"

I am trying to save after ever step so I don‚Äôt lose it all, but the save mechanism is terrible and clunky, it really should auto save to your selected game store, and load to the cloud on a regular basis.

"9105",1001250333,"This game is rigged!!! I am level 52 and all of the characters i have are obsolete meaning they will not win against all of the exotic characters they have created.

"9133",1002345611,"Very concerning. In one of the barns there's a large monster hand that reaches out and grabs the hay. This is completely unnecessary and disgusting feature to this ""game"". What on earth is the purpose for this?? No excuse. Creators should be ashamed!"
"9134",1002345611,"This game is very ambitious; it features all sorts of farm activities and tries to immerse the player in real farm work.  However, the controls are unforgivably clunky.  It is incredibly hard to control vehicles with any precision.  I can't imagine 4-year-olds having a lot of success with this game.  I think the developers did try to make a good game, but came up way short in terms of control."

"9148",1002739417,"Did not boot right the first time for me but WOW! This is the first app that I found that even comes close to VR!"
"9149",1002739417,"Not to be cheap but $2 is probably more reasonable. The view drifting forces you to slowly spin in a circle while you're playing to stay centered, which eventually makes you dizzy. Nonetheless the game changes enough to not be monotonous and is fun for 15 minutes or so at a time."
"9150",1002739417,"I am hooked on this game!!! Very good for psychotherapy. :)"
"9151",1003138996,"Huge fan here! Our table-top version is nearly worn out as BH2045 has remained a house favorite since its release. My kids love it, as do a number of friends who almost always request a game when visiting for dinner.  Easy to learn and fun to play, but strategy options run deep and evolve from game to game thanks to a variety of base teams and the ever-changing free agent pool. The game is perfect as is, but I highly recommend adding expansion pack #1 for either version (physical & digital). I find myself playing with it far more than without (Mookie Rivers for life!).  My only request for the devs is to make the base team expansions available in the app. I would be more than happy to pay for the depth and variety those different veteran lineups provide. Regardless, thank you for creating such a wonderful game!"
"9152",1003138996,"I enjoy the board game and love this version. The expansion makes for a variety of games. Would like to see total win loss records or stats for a team saved. Thanks for less sleep Where are the other teams and more game content?"
"9153",1003138996,"App needs a little work just to make it look more modern. Animations can be a little much when playing someone else. Would love to see more teams and expansions added. Gameplay wise the app is worth every penny."

"9156",1003168863,"I love bleach. This game delivers what I am looking for to keep the dream of it returned alive.   There isn‚Äôt enough to keep you going. You get 45-60 days worth of things to do for orbs and then you are done. This game needs more ways you can earn orbs or a higher output of them for daily/weekly missions. There‚Äôs a point where ALL players will earn just 1 - 5 orbs a day. Why?   Characters. The only way to get 5* characters is from ‚ÄúGachas‚Äù those who don‚Äôt know what gachas are, it‚Äôs a lottery that starts at 25 for 1 character or 250 for 10. How tough are these lotteries? Well I‚Äôve been trying for the last 5 days to get 1 person. That‚Äôs how tough.   KLab, just like any other game is greedy for money. But this game, orbs are way overpriced. And I mean way overpriced and this is coming from someone who‚Äôs spent 300$+ on a mobile game.   I want to love this game, I just can‚Äôt. After 2-3 weeks the fun is gone. KLab if you are reading this, insert more way to get orbs guys. Till then, sorry but I gotta step away."

"9162",1003287840,NA
"9163",1003716367,"Plenty of skill and strategy will be needed if you are going to make it through this game, Ellipsis. In this game you will have to navigate, using your finger on the touch-screen, a circle around the level avoiding enemies, traps, and other dangers. You will also be tasked with collecting at least four of the circle objects on the screen, but there is a catch... You see not only do you have to make contact with each of these spots on the screen, but you will have to have precision, otherwise you're not going to be able to collect all the dots inside the circles.   The dots will tell you what your final score will be, and of course the object of any game is you're going to want to catch them all. That being said, if you are a true gamer you're going to want to do speed runs in already conquered levels so that you can unlock an additional star to add to your overall score.  I had the chance to first find out about this game when I went to MomoCon, and the neon colors of the game, and the simplicity of the design drew me in. This is a very polished game, and it has one of the best features in my mind when it comes to games that are going to require you to constantly have your finger on the screen and that is instant pause if your finger leaves the screen. Holy crap, that feature alone is awesome.  The levels are quick, there's infinite tries per level, and if you start really advancing through the game different paths open up that reconnect further down the line, so there's a chance that you can get through the game without having to take on every single level, but trust me when I say, you're going to want to beat every level. Personally the feeling of accomplishment when you finally defeat a level that has thwarted you is unreal.  Alright so lets get a little bit more into the game. This of course is a game in which you are going to be guiding your circle, with the help of your finger, around the screen to specific points, each of these points has small bubbles/circles inside of them, if you just skim the point the bubbles/circles will be released into the level. You can choose not to pursue them, but you will docked at the end of the level. Each time you hit a point a new one appears, so you won't know where all of them are until you've played through the level at least once. As stated before there's always going to be an optional fifth point that will pop up at the same time that the portal shows up. To end the level you have to go through the portal, just make sure that you go between the edges of the portal and not right at the portal, I learned the hard way that you're going to bounce off of the edge and if you're being chased by something nasty, you're probably going to have to replay the level.  There is one more thing I want to say about this game and that is the game map. As you play through the game you get a new area unlocked, and the developers could have just given you linear dots on the screen with a description, but not with this game. It basically feels like you're unlocking a futuristic arcade like world where the area dots form an ever growing constellation. So with that I think you can all tell that this game, in my opinion, is solid and definitely worth your time, especially at a very reasonable price. This game gets a 9.3 out of 10."
"9164",1003716367,"Perfect example of a very inspired and well designed iOS game. Combined both quick reflexes and puzzles. The graphics are made up of simple lines, but they glow and reflect inward with depth and outward towards the player and is a  stunning effect.   The game teaches the player without the aid of any text. Everything is minimized to focus on engaging gameplay and nothing else.   The music and sound and non repetitive and changes depending on the players actions, and its ambience fits perfectly with its glowy graphics.   Throughout completing stages, the map slowly reveals itself and can be zoomed out to see its detailed beauty.. Something you'll wish you could print out and hang on your wall."
"9165",1003716367,"Amazing and beautiful visuals! Very cool!"
"9166",1003820457,"Look I know that you want money  but  i don‚Äôt think that ur thinking right abt member items but some people who have membership are happy some don‚Äôt feel bad for the nonmembers a lot of non members like me myself feel like ur forcing ppl to buy it but as long as those updates keep coming animal jam is gonna turn into the most hated game ever. üòêüòØüòïüòÆüò§üò§üòØü§¨ü§¨ü§¨‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏èüíîüíîüíî how nonmembers feel about membership"
"9167",1003820457,"So AJ is like my favorite app but the only thing I can say is that people with out membership should be treated the same mostly like getting sapphires and special items is ok because they payed for a membership but the whole they get a shop for there den and we don‚Äôt and they have there own private island is a bit much I mean really just because there members doesn‚Äôt mean they should get everything so... that‚Äôs what I think should change other then that awesome game üòÅ"
"9168",1003820457,"Ajow is turning into the pc version!!! No nonmember likesthta version due to nonmembers being able to buy the worst stuff and nothing more than a PIG. Compared to members that PAY for it they gt EVERYTHING, lots of saphires, all the items, all the best animals, and shops and pets!!!! If ajpw turns into that version... Well lets just say that you will lose ALOT of nonmembers and members. If it turns into member world. Members will quit because they turn into nonmembers. They lose their buddy‚Äôs cuz they all quit. Not to mention scammers, bullies and others will rule this world. It‚Äôs the only game that‚Äôs actually free unlike the pc version. Even if you dont read recommendations, reviews or other ppls reports, please read this one and don‚Äôt turn it into member world. I felt disappointed at this update of mokuahi. And with Leilani. I mean it‚Äôs really strange but nobody minds. Not to mention NOW you can‚Äôt go ANYWHERE whitout someoen advertising their shop while someone‚Äôs fighting cuz of dumb reasons. Nonmembers get into fights. Members get into fights. They all fight over many reasons but mainly one: These member updates. I can‚Äôt go anywhere without disagreeing about something with someone. The rate of scammers also rose. And not to mention that shops are tricking jammers out of their money. So what I mean is, Please actually DO something!!!!! This summer i got scammed. I did everything I could. I visited AJPW help center, begged for my scammed items back through the wierd box next to the news stand next to the sapphire shop. I‚Äôm having the worst days of my life in Aj. Ajpw used to be a great game, friendly jammers role playing here and there, others just complementing and getting adopted in the pillow room.  Others gifting the rest with their items not caring about scams. But now it‚Äôs the opposite, Roleplayers begging for fun, everyone fighting and scamming, the nonmembers that felt terrible quitting. Since you haven‚Äôt done ANyThing I‚Äôll paint you a clear picture. Ajpw closing down, for five years. It will be club penguin all over again but worse. Also I checked through a lot of reviews and found out you monitor chats. Due to this you could have stopped scammers!!! I myself try to stop scammers. Look at Lavaslove119. She scammed my golden water wings, Golden eagle helmet, fishbowl hat, forest tail. I replaced all of these except the golden water wings. I have golden gingerbread wings and I absolutely despise you haven‚Äôt done anything!!!! Ill be waiting for eternity if u respond"
"9169",1003822659,"Pls, pls read! Warning: It‚Äôs a bit long(:.  First suggestion: Can we change eye color? And the color wheel should have black and white furs so we won‚Äôt need that fur pattern. Not to be rude, but the color wheel dose‚Äôt work well. It looks the same kinda. Add more more fur patterns! Second suggestion: Farms and villages! Players can snatch a yummy chicken or turkey from the farm and chow down! But it isn't so simple, you must watch out for the angry and strong farmers................(Btw you need to drag a cow, and dragging is slow.) You can eat food from the trash in villages. But lots of animal control are in there, and won‚Äôt hesitate to kill you. If they DON‚Äôt fight you, they lock you in cages and you need to break out of the cage by solving puzzles and riddles, then you must defeat the guards to run to freedom.  Third suggestion: A hidden temple and hunter traps. In the panther simulator there are lots of hunter traps like quicksand and painful steel traps. You also rescue you mate from a hidden temple. Add this here pls.  Fourth suggestion: Quests and multiplayer packs.All sorts of quest from a quest where you have to kill a evil giant snake to a quest where you must deliver meats to another wolf pack. I want multiplayer wolf packs too. You can do multiplayer or normal. It‚Äôs your choice. Fifth suggestion: Multiplayer! With chat and multiplayer packs. Sixth suggestion: More realistic things. In the settings there is normal mode and hard mode. Normal is what it is now. And in hard mode it should take at least 3 adult wolves to kill a deer. In real life deer are stronger. When you are close to killing a animal it flees. Can it be slower because it is hurt? It also should get tired from running. Prey should be in small groups to defend themselves. So far only foxes and wolves are in groups. Also, when you kill something it always moves around. It‚Äôs supposed to be dead! Creepy. Either fix the rainbow wheel or get rid of it. It‚Äôs unrealistic to find a wolf with blue fur. I will repeat: Black and white should not be a fur pattern. It should be on the bottom in words. Please please please make us be able to change eye color.  Last suggestion: Wings, coins, free things! Please add wings. Dragon wings to angel fluffy wings, you can unlock them and tint them in any color you want, and you can fly  with them. Another suggestion is that you can make your games FREE. That may sound BIZZARE. How will you make money? Well, you can still get it for 0.99. But, in the free games you need coins to get fur patterns, wings, skills, buffs, and more. You earn coins for completing quests and a little for defeating animals. Quick suggestions: To be more realistic, it should take a LONG time to eat large animals like deer and even bears especially if your a lone wolf. More quick suggestions: And we should be able to bury it.  Seasons please? In the fall you can store up food since hunting gets a bit harder in the winter. Leaves are falling, trees are changing color...... all that stuff. In the winter there is snow and less animals to hunt. Some ponds are frozen over, so to drink you can steal water from humans or search for ponds and lakes that aren‚Äôt frozen. You can even see humans skiing.  In the spring lots of baby animals are out- great for hunting. But they are with angry mothers you must kill first. Trees, flowers, green plants....... people plant gardens. By the way wolves can eat fruit, so a little strawberry would be a yummy snack. Food is plentiful.  I the summer green and food is also common. But more sunshine and humans! A little buggy problem is that say if you send your pack to kill a sheep, the sheep wants to kill YOU! And I don‚Äôt like you need to be so close to kill it. Also, get rid of eating wolves pls. It sounds....... gross. Like a human eating a human. Anyway this is a good game and should be rated like 5+ or something without the blood effects. Write that under the rating! Note to parents: you can turn off the blood effects and they aren‚Äôt gross. Giving birth isn't yucky either. A small version of yourself pops up. Get this app if you want to! By the way Gluten free games this is very realistic otherwise. The graphics are great. I love when you jump in water it makes a splash with cute bubbles flying. Another game suggestion: Ultimate prehistoric simulator. There are all the species of Dinos in the ultimate plus sabertooth tiger and  wooly mammoths. There is also cavemen, but you don‚Äôt play as them. And also Ultimate Fantasy or Mythology simulator!  Hellhound, Cerberus,(you get to guard the underworld in the game pls) hydra, Nemean lion, chimera and more! Make it realistic monster tasks pls.  That‚Äôs it!"

"9183",1004539546,"This game is amazing! I have been playing for over 3 years now and still love it. The developers continue to add new content and fun things to try in the game that keep me interested. The community is great at helping new players learn tips and tricks. Here is the best part, it is NOT a pay to win game! There are many of the top players in the world that have not paid for gems (although it is an option). Each player plays against other players around their level so you will not have to battle against super high level players as you grow. The best part of the game for me is the alliance feature. Gaining friends from around the world and learning tips and tricks from each other is the finest point of this game. Banding together for timed attacks during war against other alliances is exhilarating. The crazy thing is, I play more now than I did when I first started because there are so many little things I can work toward which is amazing because my level is already maxed. You will not regret downloading this game. Find an alliance that is helpful too!"

I like how the game ‚Äútalks‚Äù about the math going on (IE: ‚ÄúOne plus four is five‚Äù). I have my son repeat this and it has helped with his basic addition/subtraction. I recommend this game for fun, while educational, learning."

"9202",1005098334,"I was able to progress through the levels, but I still felt like I was at a low level the entire time."
"9203",1005098334,"I share the developers' cynicism. We are in a mindless bureaucratic march toward nothing. But if I'm going to waste my life staring at screens, solving meaningless puzzles that have already been solved by someone else and are solvable much more easily by computer programs that have already been built‚Äîif I am to be boxed in by machines that quantify my every move‚Äîit's at least nice when the pointless puzzles are challenging.

"9207",1005322299,"Pretty funny. It also doesn't shove the ads And in app transactions in your face."
"9208",1005468883,"Followed the instructions precisely, and the very first time using it the app crashed while analyzing the data in the morning leaving no trace of sleep data. How do I get a refund?"
"9209",1005468883,"Look good but is not working, I was expecting something better but In the last week I‚Äôm trying to Use it, but I got not success I hope the developer do something about, the app look good but is not working!"
"9210",1005468883,"I‚Äôm going to give it 5 stars, although I‚Äôd like to select 4.5, because I can‚Äôt use the phone app to edit my start and stop times.  There had been a LOT of time put in this app.  I had used the previous versions on my old Gen1 Apple Watch, and they worked fairly well, but this version on Series 4 is *smooth*!   I only wish there was a function to auto-STOP the tracking if it senses I‚Äôm up moving around for a length of time, or al me to edit my start and stop time via the phone app, or at least the stop time.  There are many times that I‚Äôve gotten up and been too tired or distracted to stop the tracker right as I wake, so I may get an extra 30-60 minutes that I can‚Äôt edit out.    I‚Äôve run this in conjunction with Sleep ++ and Sleepmatic, and they are decent, but THIS app is the most accurate and allows for modifying the sensitivity (most nights I move a lot when I sleep, so I can change that after the fact and reanalyze the night‚Äôs data).  If it ever includes an auto-stop or an post-edit to select a wake time, this will get my full 5 star review."
"9211",1005783927,"Again LOVE THIS GAME"

"9217",1006393168,"This is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played it would be cool if you added a caveman or Neanderthal tribe to the special tribes I can‚Äôt wait for this game to come out on pc"
"9218",1006393168,"This is a very, very good game. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs almost perfect: the music, diversity of tribes, play style, and strategy allow it to be endlessly entertaining. However, I do wish that they would add one thing: random matchmaking or similar system so that I can queue up a quick game if my friends don‚Äôt want to, or for all the people that don‚Äôt have friends that play this game. Other than that it is an awesome game and a great download. Most underrated game on the App Store and I hope it gets the credit it deserves."

"9231",1007115851,"It‚Äôs a great game, really competitive, but after a while you begin to realize that there isn‚Äôt actually that much to the game.You beat the small campaign at the start and then you play online for the rest of the game. Like I said great game they just need to implement more things into the game. For instance they can add a two vs. two with six tracks instead of three or they can add challenges of some kind and make other ways to gain gold, manna, ranking and etc. Just something to spice it up a little and keep the player immersed. IDK just my thoughts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, hope this helps."
"9232",1007120869,"Please developers update this game to be compatible with the newest iPad pro 11inch and 12 one ... its so frustrating having a big screen and not using it ... put in mind including high resolution and 120fps option for this game"

"9238",1007177838,"This is the BEST Solitaire game in the app store period!! This forces you to use strategy and of course it has high replay value!!! No multiplayer....who cares. I enjoy this solo game! No in app purchases AND THE AI DOESN‚ÄôT CHEAT! There is luck of the draw but it‚Äôs 75% skill on the player‚Äôs part. Thank you for NOT creating a no win game! I highly recommend this game. There is logic and it makes sense! You guys rock!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"9239",1007177838,"Definitely a fun solo card game and well worth its price. It‚Äôs original and engaging. I grabbed the physical card game version too because I enjoyed this game so much."
"9240",1007177838,"My coworker and I love the real card game and the app! We would love to be able to play together on the app. Is this possible?"
"9241",1007479011,"Add more running and swimming events. Add semifinals and finals."
"9242",1007479011,"I think this is the best athletics game but I think it would be better with the following events: 200m, 800m, 4x200m, 4x400m, 400m H, 4x800m, triple jump, and 3000m steeplechase. These events shouldn‚Äôt take too long to complete. So in my opinion these events would definitely be a great addition to the game along with possibly other events like championships or/and multiplayer"
"9243",1007479011,"Everything in the game is amazing if you can add feet it would be great"
"9244",1007929736,"Hi, I am unable to sign in with Facebook, and that‚Äôs the only place I‚Äôve linked my account. When I open the app and go to sign in, it gives me the four options and I select Facebook and say to continue using that account. After I press ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù, it goes back to the four options and won‚Äôt let me do anything except repeatedly attempt to sign in. The only way to fix this problem is to uninstall and reinstall the app, which is what I had to do yesterday in order to play. This may be an issue caused by the fact that I had previously ‚Äúoffloaded‚Äù the app so it would take up less room on my phone, but whatever caused it, it is still an issue. However, despite the occasional small issues (this being the first major one), I absolutely love this game. VOEZ is my favorite music game to date, even above Rhythm Heaven which I‚Äôve been playing for almost ten years. This game definitely deserves five stars, however I can only give it four for now due to the login issue. As soon as it‚Äôs fixed, I‚Äôll happily give this game a solid five-star review! Thanks, Rayark, for making such an awesome game!"
"9245",1007929736,"My expectation was on the roof with this game because it‚Äôs made by the same Rayark that had never made an unenjoyable game. And OMG!!!! How did this game makes me wanna blow. The gameplay is outstanding, which is a upgraded version of Deemo by adding new mechanics and new efects (it‚Äôs nothing hard to learn but takes time and skill to master). The story is actually pretty interesting in it‚Äôs own way. But the music is the thing that makes this game an Editor‚Äôs Choice for Music Game category. There‚Äôre chill, pop, rock, dance and a lot more, and you don‚Äôt particularly need to unlock them because the Limited Time system lets you try out every single song in the library. Overall, a new standard for Rhythm Game."
"9246",1007929736,"There is no story that I can find,just still pictures in the diary that I can unlock by playing songs. So where is storyline?"
"9247",1008111072,"Its so so. You can play free but when you start getting higher in leagues you have to wait long periods (days even a week or so) for things to upgrade. Also you can only play 5 battles at a time, than you have to wait for more ‚Äúammo‚Äù. Lots of waiting in this game. Another BIG problem. In the middle of a battle your troops suddenly stop going where you tell them to. By the time you get them going again they‚Äôre dead. Alsoz all to often, you can clear a straight path for them to a target and when you tell them to attack they run around through all the guns instead and of coarse die. Not the best game by any means."
"9248",1008111072,"I like the game and I‚Äôd like to play it, but I simply can‚Äôt. It is clearly not built for an iPhone XR. Can‚Äôt even edit my base, every time I try to drag a building up it swipes out of the app. Also no matter which way I hold the phone, some of the options are off the screen. Again I‚Äôd like to play it and it frustrates me that I can‚Äôt."
"9249",1008111072,"The view is to wide on the iPhone XS. No way to change the screen size."
"9250",1008234539,"I like it. Not blown away. However now there is a red 2 above it saying I have some kind of notification. Looked more than once can‚Äôt find anything. App wont clear it. Signed out and in also. It‚Äôs annoying. DELETE TIME."
"9251",1008234539,"Hate that if I don‚Äôt log in within 45 days I have to re register"
"9252",1008234539,"App has been having issues logging me in.  Once I log on and accept the terms and conditions it starts telling me I have already enrolled using another account, please log in using that account.  ???  Have no idea what that means.  I‚Äôve used this app for 5 months and in the past month it‚Äôs been giving me this message when I try credit wise app"
"9253",1008496061,"This game is super under-rated‚Äîit‚Äôs great turn-based strategy. If you like Advance Wars, or Warbits, or Fire Emblem, Lost Frontier is totally worth trying out.  The teams are asymmetric too, with some interesting differences between the sides.  I wish the UI was a little clearer about which units were good/bad against which, but that‚Äôs relatively minor."
"9254",1008496061,"It‚Äôs a game like Advance War on GBA. Recalled my childhood good summer vacation with friends.  One-stop buy a Full-game, without any in-app purchase or ADs.  Awesome graphic and BGM, included story mode and challenge maps.  iCloud save state restore supported! You can play continue your save stage on iPhone or iPad, switch easily. Don‚Äôt worry for lost save process even you lost your iPhone.   But, I found few little bugs, e.g. enemy hero‚Äôs special power disappeared when I restart the game. Unlimited moves in one round, when I click ‚Äùend turn‚Äù then exit the app from background. And this game had no updates more than 2 years after last update. Even so, it‚Äôs my favorite game on my iPhone.  Looking forward lost frontier 2!"
"9255",1008496061,"Could someone either open-source this or charge me $20 for a DLC expansion (just more maps, minimal effort). There simply isn‚Äôt anything else with this classic TBS format & perfect iPhone play. Kills me that it‚Äôs just sitting and growing dusty.  My favorite iPhone game so far. I have searched obsessively for a turn based strategy game that incorporated terrain, unit types, capturing & defending space and am really glad I finally found Lost Frontier. It‚Äôs perfectly formatted for an iPhone screen, is easy to pick up and has alot of depth and enjoyable challenges in the campaigns. My only regret is that having finished the game twice there is no second version to buy. Well worth the trivial price and a great relief from the litany of ‚Äúfree to play‚Äù junk. Saddle up!"
"9256",1008519817,"I have been playing this game for a long time. one of my most enjoyable games until I reached level 1,000.  The game constantly crashes and loose my games.  Can't play at all.  This becomes most frustrating.  Hope you can rectify this problem soon.  Will sure miss playing.  Since this past Wed., I have lost over 50 keys due to the game crashing .  I have been frozen on level 1363 since early this morning and still stuck, I have 14 keys, and want to. Finish this.  A good game but too many malfunctions.  Extremely frustrating.  Too many snags in the game.  Does not give you what it says you should get, and freezes so you don‚Äôt get the points you received, and cannot continue to play.  Your game has bee been frozen all day!  AGAIN!!!  9-18-2019. Again, your game is frozen.  How long is this going to go on along w/saying free keys & turns & NOTHING.  Again, the game says free keys, and all day they have to not given me the free keys.  Do you want to lose the people who play this game?"
"9257",1008519817,"I played this game for months without any problems and enjoyed it. Then a month or two ago the ads increased to twice as often,  and then just today all the sudden it popped up an ad that included sexual positions and heavy breathing. Not exactly what I‚Äôd call an app appropriate for 4+!!!! Very disappointing. There are plenty of games like this. Pick one of their competitors instead. I‚Äôm deleting it."
"9258",1008519817,"I have been sitting at level 1875 for over 3 months. Is this as far as it goes?"

"9261",1008546049,"With the new iPad, you can change between the eraser and pencil/pen by tapping on the pen itself, but this app doesn‚Äôt have that feature where as other apps do."
"9262",1008692660,"This so far is the best IOS game that I have played. It deserves a much better rating than it currently has. My guess is that too many people have installed this on phones with small screens or older devices with too limited memory. This game plays very well on a newer iPad with sufficient memory. Once you get past the initial learning curve you will find this game to be very fun and addictive."
"9263",1008692660,"I Love This App So Much But There Is No Sci-Fi Themed Food & I Would Like It If You Could Add Something Like Space Kebabs & Alien  Or Something Like That"
"9264",1008692660,"RCT3 needs to be updated because the peeps are laggy but some are cute lol üòÇ but I just want to say that if we can have a smooth tool for are coasters Because the coasters are to ruff, but when i went on to play this game the next day i went on sandbox mode and then I went on I got kicked out and I had so many theme parks and I had to delete and download this again but I still liked it!"
"9265",1008719508,"The game itself is fine, but there are repeated ads in a paid game. Even if they're for another game by the same developer I can't support that."

"9270",1009134067,"Free gold"
"9271",1009227147,"I mean, come on... let‚Äôs be reasonable. This is a fun-ish game. But after a while it gets really boring. I think the creator should update it or something. Like maybe they could make some new maps and characters! But what would be really cool is if they made different vault sticks. Any way, if you are looking for a fun game that never gets boring... I would look for a different game."
"9272",1009227147,"This game is freaking great! Love the innovative controls, retro graphics, and cool landscape. I‚Äôd love if you added more maps! And I guess more characters. Also, would be great to have challenges and quests that keep you coming back. The game as it is is fantastic, keep up the great work!"

"9280",1009442510,"I got this game expecting to be able to color a group foto with my friends, then i was going to send to print to hang in our lockers. But the quality was absolutely horrifying. Theres just random lines everywhere, somewhat outlining the picture. You have to  pay for many colors, 75% of the drawings, and it costs 10 dollars a week!! If you want to make great pictures like the lady licking the lollipop, find another app. It is just a false add that is not true at all. Oh and now it doesn't let me make my own pictures.  I am very disappointed."

"9302",1010739052,"WOW SO GOOD BUT YOU MAKE ME TRIED"
"9303",1010739052,"I have both MSM games, but I think Dawn of Fire is superior by far. I love the way you have to make actual orders instead of just feeding them, and I love the way they all have their own designated islands. The baby monsters are adorable in every way, and their songs are all so beautiful (Except Flowah, but that‚Äôs just my opinion) and come together to make a musical masterpiece. No lie, sometimes I just open the app to listen to the tiny concert. I think my favorite monster is probably the Reedling because of its adorable, dog-like look and beautiful song that kind of reminds me of the bagpipes. It‚Äôs a must-buy for anyone who‚Äôs into music and cute mythical creatures."

"9307",1010801519,"I‚Äôm honestly bored of this app. I wish there was more to do..... because pretty much all you do is run around the map I‚Äôve discovered like 10 times and attack everything...."
"9308",1010801519,"Please someone help me with this!"
"9309",1010801519,"The Gluten Free games are the best (only when they do animal sims). It‚Äôs defiantly worth the money. This is my favorite  I they made, as I am a very strong lion lover. Anyways, I watch a lot of Nat-Geo Wild, and while I do that, I play the Gluten Free games. If I‚Äôm watching a lion, I play Lion Sim. You can hunt, find a pride, and breed and have cute cubs! No ads, great grafics, and a very realistic and accurate simulation of a lion. ü¶Åü¶Åü¶Å Totally worth the money!"
"9310",1010803520,"4 stars already because it‚Äôs not actually complete trash, however graphics could be better, but it is just a mobile game"
"9311",1010803520,"So the game is lots of fun and good for story telling, but there are plenty of bad glitches. The worst is a meteor shower glitch, I was playing and then a meter shower happened I had an egg that was going to hatch in 9:00 minutes. I ran dodging meteors left and right. I made it to my den and my egg would hatch in 8 minutes now. Then the game crashed, which always happens with meteor showers... and then I got on again and guess what! 15:00 minutes till my egg hatches. üò≠  The second glitch is that killing prey makes them stretch?  The third glitch is with fish. The fish float in mid air and if you kill one of them they crash your game or they make you fall through the world.  Fourth glitch! If you get a quest from the swamp totem called ‚ÄòAged Skulls‚Äô and accept the dots show up on your map, and if you go to collect the skull there is like a weird barrier thingie and it usually glitches out prey near it.  Finally glitch! Boss fight glitching. I was level 14 or something and went to fight a boss alone. I attacked the boss and ran and attacked and when it was defeated I glitched out and lost all the exp I had gotten in the past few minutes.   Sorry it‚Äôs soooo long! Please fix!"
"9312",1010803520,"I love this game it‚Äôs very fun but it‚Äôs kind of weird When you‚Äôre on low Health looks like you have no health and then one more  hit and then you die it‚Äôs kind of weird but it‚Äôs fun and I still haven‚Äôt found out how to change dinosaurs It‚Äôs very hard to survive on the meteors get in the game l lm on level 9 And I can‚Äôt get to level 10 without dinosaurs killing me"
"9313",1010962391,"I don‚Äôt like or play many games, but I do like this one, think it‚Äôs fun and sometimes consumes too much of my time.  Please take the last phrase as a big compliment given my tendency to avoid games.  I think the concept for the game fits very well with the explosion of interest in design mainly due to the influence of HGTV and the pioneer design show of the past that have and had competitive spirits as the root of the show.  I also think the player interface and number of elements a player has input ability to go a long way to make this highly interesting and keeps players engaged.  So kudos to all involved in the birth of the ideas for the game, for the execution and delivery of a quality product, and for tweaks and changes as the product. Continues to evolve.  In-app-purchases and absolutely necessary and the business model chosen by most developers today.  I have no issue at all with supporting that business model and prefer it much more than subscriptions.   Another thing you do well is allow free access to every element in the game, which is not common.  Also, with judicious decisions and the ability to earn them for free, a player can go a long way in this game without spending a penny.  So along with the kudos, I‚Äôd like to pass along some aspects of the game that in my own opinion, should be considered important to future updates.     First, I‚Äôve not found a way to change my identity in the game from USER XXXXXXXXXX to a name of my choosing and basically create a profile other than by logging in through a Facebook account.  I refuse to join Facebook and because I do, I‚Äôm prevented from establishing an identity in the game.  I hope there is another way I have missed to login, because if there isn‚Äôt  I won‚Äôt continue to use the game.  I refuse to have to bow to Facebook to use a piece of software and would like a reply from the developer about this.  In my opinion, the weakest part and it‚Äôs very weak, is the voting. How in the world can a design achieve a 5.0 when the designer uses the same piece of wall art multiple times in a room?  If my designer did that, I‚Äôd fire her/him in a second.  Another thing that gets overlooked in voting, is the hodgepodge of finishes (e.g. dark wood, silver, gold, bronze, light wood, etc.) for things like cocktail table, end table, sofa, chair and ottoman legs that again I‚Äôd fire my designer for putting in my house that frequent in rooms that  receive a 5.0 score.  Finally, 5.0 scores are common for designs that are totally inconsistent with the design instructions that are given and I‚Äôm sure frustrate players as I‚Äôve seen reviews citing that issue.  I don‚Äôt have an answer to this other than dropping the vote altogether, but feel it is such a weak part of the game that serious noodling should be done.  Finally, I have had a problem receiving ‚Äúfree diamonds‚Äù that were earned by making a hotel reservation and staying at the hotel through one of your sponsors who is no longer in your list.  I‚Äôm not sure how to rectify this since the sponsor is no longer in your list.  I hope my comments are helpful."
"9314",1010962391,"First, I really enjoy the actual design aspect of the game.  Unfortunately, when scoring the designs, very little, if any consideration is given to the original intent of the design, instead, having voting more of a popularity contest than a true design assignment. This seems to be a complaint across the other reviews for this app I have read. Second, and probably the most frustrating part of entering the room design contests, is purchasing furniture, finishing the room and having the corresponding monies deducted from my account....And then, an error occurs and it deletes my room design, forcing me to start over from scratch. This wouldn‚Äôt be so horrible if it also put the money spent on furniture during that particular room design back into my account...it doesn‚Äôt and you end up losing your money.. They also could use a better way of reviewing and sorting your inventory...a good ‚Äúsort‚Äù feature. Which brings me to my third and biggest complaint;  the lack of response from customer service.  Currently, I have an open e-mail from June 11th, 12 days without any response.  I also make sure I update that email, advising them it remains without response.  I have probably spent over $250, much of which was lost during the frequent technical issues that force a reboot mid-game. It is now mid-September and I am still having the same, unanswered issue. They have closed and deleted the correspondence so I am not able to view or print it.  I have made many requests for hard copy print outs to share with my bank to fight the inaccurate charges. The last correspondence took weeks before I received a reply from a ‚Äúperson‚Äù.  I was the asked to confirm some information...unfortunately, when I wasn‚Äôt able to respond within 48 hours, they closed they email and deleted it from view so I was no longer able to reference the issue for my bank. They need to have a better response system, more timely responses, and to provide their customers, me, with a copy of my purchase history alongside the reboot history so I can compare this and obtain a refund of the incorrectly billed funds. Four months is ridiculous. I‚Äôve since requested all the back copies of my correspondence...they delete them from your sight when they determine to close them, even when, like me, the issue is never resolved. It‚Äôs really too bad these problems are becoming more of an issue...I am looking for a different room design app to replace this."
"9315",1010962391,"The game is great, until you rack up inventory that you bought and it disappears, that should be fixed, I deliberately bought an item 3 times and it kept deleting."
"9316",1010999283,"Hey. This game is awesome, and I recommend it. But I came here to say something else.     I‚Äôm very proud of Gluten Free Games. If you take a look at Wild Horse Simulator, made by Gluten Free Games, then at this game, there‚Äôs major improvement. I‚Äôve had Wild Horse Simulator for years. I‚Äôd love to say that if one of the creators are reading this, that I‚Äôll always be around to play your games and support you. Thank you so much for all your games, it truly means a lot."
"9317",1010999283,"this game is OK the controls are OK I can this company make an Ultimate Pok√©mon simulator? if you do then I‚Äôll be happyüòä"
"9318",1010999283,"Idk how to breed do you and your mate need to be at the same level?.idk tell me.anyway I like playing this game right now because my cat is missing I miss her I‚Äôve said to much ok now anyway it would mean a lot if you would tell me how to breed"
"9319",1011000146,"The Ultimate Dragon Simulator, is awesome! Although some more elements would make it even better. Plus I think that you should make it that dragons can have more then one element. Like a fire dragon can also be storm and use storm attacks. And you should maybe make a water element and a nature element. But while I love this game, Gluten Free Games, have another game idea and if you already saw my old review about the ""Ultimate Desert Simulator"", you can forget it (optional) because I have a brand new idea: the ""Ultimate Fantasy Simulator."" So in the beginning you start out as a dragon with the wyvern also already unlocked. Then at level 5 you unlock the rock golem. And at level 10 you unlock the orc. And at level 15 you unlock the fairy. And at level 20 you unlock the unicorn. And at level 25 you unlock the gryphon. And at level 30 you unlock the cerberus. And at level 35 you unlock the treent. And finally at level 40 you unlock the phoenix. And the different areas should be the lava land, the arctic, the sky islands, and the forest which should be in the same area that the humans live in. And the Aggressive Creatures should be: Dragons, Wyverns, Rock Golems, Orcs, Gryphons, Cerberuses,  Phoenixes, Wolves, Killer Mushrooms, Sea Serpents, Bears, Ice Creatures (monsters made of ice and bone), and Lava Creatures (monsters made of lava and bone). And Passive Creatures should be: Fairies, Unicorns, Treents, Sheep, Goats, Deer, Flying Pigs (pigs with white wings), Frog People (small frogs that walk on there hind legs and ware clothes like little people), Fish, Mermaids, and Villagers. And if you add warriors like knights, archers, etc. is it possible to make them act aggressively towards aggressive creatures like dragons but not passive creatures like fairies? If so, that would be great. And maybe you could give some of the playable animals powers like for example the dragon could breathe fire or the gryphon could create tornadoes that damage its enemies. And the dragon should eat ONLY Meat. The wyvern should eat ONLY Meat. The rock golem should eat Rocks ONLY. The orc should eat ONLY Meat. The fairy should eat ONLY Plants. The unicorn should eat ONLY Plants. The griffin should eat ONLY Meat. The cerberus should eat ONLY Meat. The treent should eat ONLY Plants. And the phoenix should eat ONLY Meat. So pleeeeeeeeese consider my idea!"
"9320",1011000146,"First this game is awesome I love it but whenever I go into my den I can‚Äôt see anything it‚Äôs gray and black and glitch and I can‚Äôt take my baby dragon out of the den without seeing so I NEED you to FIX these glitches my brother has the game and his dens are fine mine are glitched I NEED this to get FIXED this is why I give it 3 stars because of the glitches and I HATE games that have glitches in them they annoy me SO much"
"9321",1011000146,"The Fire Ice and Storm elements are nice and all, but add some new ones, like Dark and Nature. You should be able to create your own fire, if you don‚Äôt want a element.   Please take my review into account.  (Edit) Hi I have noticed that my review has not been read. I LOVE this game, but it‚Äôs getting.... boring with only 3 elements! PLEASE make more elements! It would be so fun with new attacks! Again, please take my review into account. Oh and my Storm dragon, Stardust, is level 96 not kidding it awesome and it has the Celestial ranking!  (Edit) Hi!! I‚Äôm super exited because my Stardust is level 100 now! Yay! So so so sorry for asking again, but more elements!"
"9322",1011132019,"Too hard"
"9323",1011132019,"Every Roli app has a major problem, rendering it useless - which is really sad because the hardware is awesome.  This particular app has a distorted sound that makes it impossible to navigate, very frustrating."
"9324",1011132019,"I do NOT want an account and I do NOT want to ‚Äúregister‚Äù my device I want to USE THE DEVICE I PAID FOR!!!  Yet I am FORCED to do both with this crappy app.    Screw you and your pushy dark patterns, sorry I paid money for this horrible experience."
"9325",1011193872,"Reely gud gaam is fun."
"9326",1011193872,"A couple of things, This game is really good and has a lot of potential but there are some bugs that are really annoying and can make a player be really annoyed. First thing when you tap around a monster the monster changes directions and can ruin your score especially if your trying to get a flawless every time. Another thing is when I clicked on the monster icon to watch a video for my ""coins"" It just loaded the entire time leading me to restart my game. Also when I got to planet 3 level 1 I got passed that level but it kept on resend It kept on resenting me back. Lastly like I stated before I like to get 3 stars so when I don't I like to retry but there's no retry button so I have to go to home and find my level I was on just to retry it or I have to do the entire level to retry it again which is quite annoying."
"9327",1011193872,"This game is very bad it is fun at the beginning but gets very hard very fast until it's almost impossible to beat."
"9328",1011396240,"Works just fine turns switches on and off when connected to the same network.  My only issue is I created groups with Wemo light bulbs.  I had issues with this at first some being me not knowing exactly what I was doing, but finally was able to create a group and it works just fine.  The issue is creating the previous groups until I got it right, the previous groups still show up even though they aren‚Äôt used and I see no way to delete them."

"9348",1011788068,"I love this app, I‚Äôve had it for years but it can be buggy at times. It crashes or doesn‚Äôt load. This doesn‚Äôt happen very often and when it happens the Developers fix it right away, however it still is annoying when it does happen and you can‚Äôt play for a few hours. Other than that, this is a great game. I love trying to climb the leaderboard and getting all the achievements done to make my profile look better. The community is decently active. Would recommend.  EDIT: I‚Äôm giving this 5 stars now because it does not crash as often and is the only active WYR app on the AppStore that I‚Äôm aware of. It still can be buggy at times, but like I said the Developers fix it the first moment they can."

Anyway, the game is Ads free and free of charge, so rare. all this to say that this game is a lot of fun and I recommend it to anybody and everybody! :)"

"9366",1012032539,"I don't like how I can't see what number or contact is popping up for any sideline call. I have to wait until the the suspected spam call has been declined to see who it really is.  I also don't like that there is a delay in texts when I am receiving long texts so the order is mixed up. I can't use this number to confirm security/bank issues.  I had to upgrade to the $59 dollar plan - was the cheaper alternative but not any more. There are other cheaper options. It is cheaper than a true phone line but it could be improved."

"9378",1012298403,"It glitches, freezes in don‚Äôt starve original and I can‚Äôt even craft stuff properly in shipwrecked. Got an upgrade from a iPhone 7 Plus to a XR and can‚Äôt play either games without issues every 5-10 minutes"

"9385",1012712705,"Amazing Game! It‚Äôs one of those addicting games when you make a village and its kinda like clash of clans or boom beach.the only downside is that when you need more gems it has a time limit for getting them and when you tap on it it won‚Äôt work. But overall it‚Äôs pretty good!"
"9386",1012712705,"There are a lot of choices in how to develop and deploy your fleet, and island features. You can maneuver individual ships in battle. You get to pick where your workers spend their time. This makes the game a lot of fun.   If there weren‚Äôt some glitches in the UI displaying build times, and assigning workers, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars instead of 4."
"9387",1012712705,"This game has fury little animals in sea boats. THIS IS A Awesome APP."

"9396",1013585593,"After going through the triangle, square, and pentagon I fully expected a hexagon. When it didn‚Äôt materialize, and the game was over, I have to admit getting a bit annoyed. There really isn‚Äôt any enjoyment in repeating the puzzles so would have loved a few more puzzles. It would have made more sense to stop at the octagon heheh. In the end it was fun while it lasted."

"9401",1013992870,"I haven‚Äôt played long but I literally can‚Äôt when the game crashes every few minutes. I‚Äôve had to close the game and open it back up more than a few times within an hour or so. Not only that but crafting and building times including activities to get the resources needed take hours which isn‚Äôt really ideal especially for the ‚Äúkids‚Äù this game is marketed toward or anyone for that matter."
"9402",1013992870,"Two weeks later: Did not invest my own money but it was happy to take away my dollar bills.  Also when you put in any gates, flower, or bushes, they are never in their original location. It crashed a couple of times then the roads and buildings didn‚Äôt even display.  I decided to delete at level 50.  One month later: am I the only one? Dollar bills go missing. I had just purchased a package so there were a few hundred bills. The second time I made a note and contacted support but no response.    I no longer will invest any money in this game.  Other games have options if want to purchase but this makes mandatory. I had never had spend such money on a game.   1. if I choose to skip by viewing the video, it will either crash on specific ads or won‚Äôt skip the time (usually Lily‚Äôs Garden)  2. it says it doesn‚Äôt require an internet connection but when it crashes it often gives ‚Äúunable to connect to internet‚Äù and Woodstock appears.  3. it‚Äôs an interesting game but it slows down the game after the space town update.  4. If I joined late, how can I get access to some of the characters?"

"9408",1014459049,"The app won‚Äôt open for the iPhone X or beyond IOS 11.  Support responds to email with a repeat of your question; no resolution.  So disappointing!  I gave one star because a rating is required to post a review.   There should be guidelines of how long an app will be supported  for operating systems, timeline for fixes and refund options.  Too many apps are abandoned that result in lost funds to the buyer."
"9409",1014565551,"i love sago mini. i was dissappointed though. i love there games but in this game you make houses witch its very creative. but riyliey just turned 6 and she says its boring. i loved it like her but then she said get the secret button (update) its too hard for kids to get three fingers on there. she now has scraches."

"9411",1014565551,"Hi, my son is a huge fan of all the sago mini games, and we haven't had an issue until now. I installed the most recent update giving access to build the new houses, and now when the vehicle gets to the end of each ""board"" it just shuts the game off. Completely. As if he hit the home button. It's doing this on the new houses as well as the old. He is super frustrated and crying (only 4, highly emotional). I would give you 5 stars and more on everything you put out...but can you look into this?"
"9412",1014902505,"I like how it shows you your target time while you are playing"

"9416",1014919815,"I love this game so much and play it every day. Sometimes the stages are super hard and I‚Äôm having a lot of trouble getting past the Snorlax stage, but it‚Äôs ok. Still a very fun game!"
"9417",1014919815,"I just wish they would reload hearts more faster But amazing I would recommend it for anyone"
"9418",1014920360,"Comparable to This War of Mine and N.E.O. Scavenger.  This game has a high difficulty level. You may enjoy playing it if you like repetition and strategy.  Drawbacks: resources and crafting are very tightly balanced and you‚Äôll die quickly if you don‚Äôt manage everything precisely. There is very little online support in English and most reviews only reach the 30-day mark."
"9419",1014920360,"You have to buy the game. Then after that, of you want a dog, different people, better skills, you have to pay for it. So even though you ALREADY PAID for the game, you have to pay to play even more. Just go play This War of Mine. This is a knock off for it anyways. At least with them it's not pay to play."
"9420",1014920360,"It‚Äôs a great game but when you die over and over it get a little repetitive"
"9421",1015000630,"Very fun scenarios, each a different idea."
"9422",1015000630,"Only two of ten missions are included.  You have to pay to unlock the others.  For an aging game concept this misleading value is irritating.  ""May include in app purchases to access what you just purchased?!?""   Sorry, I'll pass on future products from this company."

Also, we just played the dinosaur dig 3 times to get the achievement and tried to uncover all the items and the dirt never disappears completely so we never get the achievement so the other levels don't get unlocked. No wonder he gets bored with it and doesn't want to play this app anymore. Please fix."

Honestly the simplicity of the app and navigation is what got me, along with their amazing themes which i am currently using the Cobalt theme. I have been using the nest-tagging system and the Note Linking to the max and pretty much addicted lol.   It would be great to include different font color options. This would be a great addition when you want to really get in depth with organizing and highlighting. Now this would be potentially cause an issue with Markdown compatibility but if you are able to get around that it would be an added bonus."

The red flag is already there when I saw the poor package of the products ‚Äî there are some gaps in the eyeshadow plate edges. The quality is obviously much lower than the brands I selected on the survey. So I terminated my subscription. However I don‚Äôt know what to do with the first month‚Äôs products. I considered giving them away to my friends but honestly I don‚Äôt think anyone would want to take them even for free! I feel scammed because of the survey!

"9467",1017148055,"I used to love this app! Now it‚Äôs meh. I‚Äôm already looking into less annoying alternatives. Why is it so easy to accidentally set up auto stash after a transaction? I don‚Äôt want it, so, stop asking me. Why do you constantly prompt me to tell my friends? The ones that wanted it already have it. I don‚Äôt care about your debit card. Just let me make a purchase without having to jump through hoops or constantly being solicited."
"9468",1017148055,"Good way to save and invest. I forget that I am putting money there. Great app"

"9484",1017627073,"It nice and fun, but combos aren‚Äôt detected very often. Although the bubbles are lit up, they pop one at a time and fill the tank quickly. My daughter has tried so many times to get the third fish on a level, but it seems about impossible... especially on the first level!!!"
"9485",1017627073,"Perhaps matching numbers to what is showing on the screen for younger kids. Current games are confusing."
"9486",1017627073,"This is a great game to learn numbers but I wish it verbally said the number."
"9487",1018002876,"I've been a huge fan of Orange Pixel since Meganoid hit the AppStore years back, so my review is probably going to be pretty bias (just laying it out there, also of note, I've become a pretty big TBS and Roguelike fan over the last couple years). But, this is definitely up there among the best games that they have put out. I don't know if Heroes of Loot or this, Space Grunts, is my #1 favorite OP game, but they both give up an amazingly spectacular run for it. The controls might take some getting use to, as they're virtual, but resizing is coming in an update and ATM you can place every button wherever you'd like on the screen. Once I played about 3 games, they were perfect. I couldn't imagine playing it any other way. The mix of action and turn-based gameplay is done incredibly well. I really just can not stop gushing about every aspect of the game. The menus are well done, the UI layout/map setup is on point, the graphics are killer (though they may not look it in the AppStore screens, the game looks GREAT in motion - check out some HQ vids!), the roguelike aspect is done perfectly---It's a great game. One that has already (VERY VERY quickly) earned it's spot on my own GOTY list (#2 of 2 ATM [Feb]) - but I wholeheartedly recommend this to roguelike fans itching for the genre to take a turn towards more arcade-based gameplay. =oD  **update**  The new update rocks... thank you for the resizing controls option, the new item and giving each character a level upgrade once they beat the game (having something that sticks with you after making it through that was a great decision...) - and the tweaks. This has very quickly become, not only one of my favorite games of the year, but also one of my favorite roguelikes ever. GET IT!!!!"
"9488",1018002876,"I've had this game for a few years. High scores have never connected.    Gameplay in itself is alright.  The current price of 3.99 is kind of steep for what your getting.   The game offers decent combat but very little depth.   This is one of those play for 5 minutes to see how far you can progress, die, and restart.    There are three characters, but nothing to really work for and nothing to unlock."
"9489",1018002876,"It's a good little game. Controls are a little funky at times, but otherwise you're given what they show. Certainly worth more than 1.99."

For example, the entry for a country would provide the country's flag and a couple of maps.  This ""new, improved"" app got rid of this kind of material.  I really regret purchasing it since, by the time I actually move on to iOS 11, the developer will probably have come up with a new app replacing this one, a new app with even less content, needless to say."
"9495",1018216485,"I am learning French by reading French ebooks, among other things.    I literally cannot imagine how much more difficult it would be to learn French without this app.    It is much more convenient than a regular dictionary because you can cut a word from the ebook/article/whatever, then paste it into the search bar of the app.  That is MUCH faster than using a paper dictionary.    The word is almost always in the dictionary -- with French definitions, usage, verb conjugations, special usages, ..  You can look up a verb from any of its forms.  I.e., you do not need to know the infinitive.  There are a few small gaps, but overall this really sets the standard for a well-designed dictionary app.  I only wish I could find similar apps for other languages.  A VERY good value."
"9496",1018236462,"Has awesome clothes, especially for plus size women. The app is just really slow and closes itself while you‚Äôre on it.."
"9497",1018236462,"First time using the app and it‚Äôs so much easier than the browser! Not app related, but I always use express shipping and they always meet the expected delivery date! Currently waiting on a order to be delivered today ü•∞ Thanks Boohoo üíï"
"9498",1018236462,"The app does not match the website. It‚Äôs hard finding certain items on the app that are easily found on the site. Also the advertisements never match which is also annoying."
"9499",1018355599,"I‚Äôm out on the farm a lot, at the very edge of cell coverage. Twitter‚Äôs native app is so crufted up with surveillance gear that it can‚Äôt load content.  Tweetbot works fine. I wish it was easier to block and mute, though."
"9500",1018355599,"The best Twitter app bar none"
"9501",1018355599,"Tap the messages icon and it brings it current. No scrolling FOREVER. Easier access to your profile page. One click style. Otherwise not bad."
"9502",1018356776,"Was fun to play at first...now every time I go in to play it closes back out"

"9505",1018357323,"So I play the game and then it gets stuck. I cannot do anything. So I say ok lets restart it and start again form the beginning. (After playing it for two in a half days)! Then I get farther and everytime the guy hands me the orb the whole game shuts down completely! Wth!!  Ugh!!!"
"9506",1018357323,"I've been a huge fan of BFG for a VERY long time now, but as of late, they are a totally different company, and one I really don't like. First, they don't give you the first chapter free anymore (if they had, I would have seen that I had already downloaded and paid for this game, but they re-advertised it and I thought it was a new game, and since the first chapter wasn't FREE, I was forced to buy it before finding out I've already played it). Second, game prices jumped from two dollars a game to seven dollars a game over night?!? Perhaps this company is going for all new customers and couldn't care less about the old ones, because, as an old customer, I'm getting fed up with these antics."
"9507",1018357323,NA
"9508",1018497986,"Not sure yet."
"9509",1018497986,"But it's VERY short and not at all interactive. Not worth paying 99¬¢"
"9510",1018497986,"For cardboard it doesn‚Äôt render together and causes a lag in one of the dual screens and that is the worse part!!"
"9511",1018704225,"It Is awesome"
"9512",1018704225,"This was a great game there are only a couple of bugs I have experienced, myself. I think the mmo aspect is very cool and adds another layer of depth to this great game. I recommend this game to everyone, as it is a blast to play!"
"9513",1018704225,"Hey, nice game bro. It's fun because you can evolve and it's really satisfying because you can see the money bar go up and you can go like 'Yes I'm making progress!!!'"
"9514",1018743724,"When I first downloaded the game, I was honestly expecting just another endless runner game. I couldn‚Äôt have been any more wrong! From the first level, I was captivated by the beautiful soundtracks, graphics, and most of all, the heartfelt storyline. I really love how the storyline is incorporated with each level and the music compliments it so well. I truly felt myself immersed in the characters‚Äô story and felt all the ups and downs just as much! It‚Äôs always amazing when a game is made so well that players feel that they are a part of it along with the characters-and this game really goes above and beyond. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve written a review in about 2 years, and just after playing the first 5 levels I came straight here to write this! I will thoroughly enjoy continuing to play this game, I can‚Äôt wait for what comes next! I highly recommend this. Like I said in the title, the developers have truly crafted a masterpiece. Keep up the good work! :)"
"9515",1018743724,"I couldn‚Äôt hold myself from crying. One of the best dramas ever"
"9516",1018743724,"I thought there was no music game like Geometry Dash until I saw this, so here is some reasons why I LOVE this game!üòâ 1. I love the background for all of the levels. I hadn‚Äôt played them all but, so far, so goodüòä 2. LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è the music. 3. WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN MUSIC LEVELS! YASSSSSSSSSSSS! BEST MUSIC GAME EVER"
"9517",1018920593,"I have always wanted a game like this"
"9518",1018920593,"It‚Äôs a great for all ages and it‚Äôs an addictive"
"9519",1018920593,"Have fun"
"9520",1018922850,"I pay for this and I can‚Äôt even preview it without pop ups and an icon that just won‚Äôt go away harassing me for a review. Seriously.   So here is your review, jackasses. The lowest I can give. Why even waste your time making an app if your going to do juvenile crap like that.   Idiots!"

"9522",1018922850,"Does a nice job custom editing speed of videos. Has some handy filters, too. My favorite thing about this app is the ‚ÄúLive Photo‚Äôs‚Äù feature that let‚Äôs me export them as videos instead of just a single image, even the sound they capture. Sweet app!"
"9523",1018955135,"So far so good with this app. Easy to use and most pics are edited outside of this app then transferred"
"9524",1018955135,"Cutest designs."
"9525",1018955135,"This app makes marking milestones in my daughters life so simple and so adorable!!! It's so easy to use and I wish I would have gotten it ages ago!! I love that you can add stickers and customize colors to make anything look perfect!!"

"9527",1019167420,"All my kids love this app especially my son who is five and has autism!! It's very much like the show my daughter is four and she loves it as well"

"9529",1019230398,"This is the best $5 you will ever spend. As someone with PTSD and clinical depression, it can be critical to track your moods. This is the very easiest way to do that. This is great for CBT and DBT. It‚Äôs great for everyone. It‚Äôs like washing your face. It keeps you healthy."
"9530",1019230398,"Excellent excellent excellent app! Please add the ability to print to PDF in REVERSE /chronological order."
"9531",1019230398,"I‚Äôm currently a freelance app developer and this application has a design that I envy. I truly wish I had thought of something this seamless, informative, and simple for an app design.  It functions amazingly as journal and mood tracker. I highly recommend for anyone looking for something easy to use daily."
"9532",1019312381,"I had to take it out because its spell word guesses were terrible. So terrible that they force a rewrite. I am writing to fellow attorneys about legal stuff so the la guage has to be fight and there seems to be no way to turn off the spell guesser rewrite of ,y texts."
"9533",1019312381,"As someone else stated, this app does not work on the 2018 iPad Pro. Every time the Hemingboard keyboard is selected as the primary, the iPad stutters, then kicks it back to the default."
"9534",1019312381,"I'm enjoying it, its easy to use.  For $3 and there's no subscription? Sign me up. Well worth the money."
"9535",1019442026,"My daughter is having the best time of her LIFE!!!!"
"9536",1019442026,"It does,t teach anything it does,t teach notes"
"9537",1019442026,"This app is great, when it recognizes the notes you‚Äôre playing. It is incredibly frustrating to be constantly stuck repeating the practice mode because it didn‚Äôt recognize a note even when the correct note was played. They offer many solutions, but it doesn‚Äôt improve the experience. I can easily turn the volume up on my keyboard far enough for the app to (finally) hear the notes, but I‚Äôm afraid it upsets my neighbors. Also, I highly recommend regularly returning to the previous lessons to review because the app goes too quickly if just following along. I think this would be bested as a aid to someone already receiving lessons; I don‚Äôt believe this is a good enough tool to learn playing by itself."
"9538",1019447011,"App crashes 1 second after i open it every time ü•∫ i just wanna watch videos n live concerts pls, i had to cancel my svt and mx subscriptions because i cant open the app."
"9539",1019447011,"Love VLive+ simply to feed my addiction for all things BTS, but why oh why can‚Äôt you just let me screen mirror to my Apple TV or better yet it cast directly to my Apple TV?!?!!!!! There was one update a few months ago that allowed me to do it and I was so excited. But the next update seemed to wipe that out and I can‚Äôt anymore. Please fix this! Would love to be able to watch it on my TV again instead of my phone."
"9540",1019447011,"it doesnt work on my iphone its just a blue screen when i open it I dont know what to do"
"9541",1019838009,"The game doesn‚Äôt seem to be compatible with the current version of Watch OS.. Shame too.. since I just finished the book.  The last update appears to be 2 years ago.. not holding my breath for any further updates."
"9542",1019838009,"it‚Äôs fun and there are some problems. overall a great game"
"9543",1019838009,"Remember tamagotchis? Those electronic needy pet things from the 90s? That‚Äôs what this is like. They dumb down Mark a bit and give you canned answers to tell him. It‚Äôs fun, for all that, but know what you‚Äôre getting. <follow up> I stopped playing. Apparently, in this game‚Äôs world, NASA is incapable of calculating thrust/weight, and most of the plan they send to Mark is wrong. He dies a lot. It gets tiresome. I have to wonder if the game designers even read the book."
"9544",1019856486,"I've played this game on my Kendal and it was wonderful so purchasing it for my iPad was a no brainer but from the start it's been horrible from taking me 2 days to get it downloaded to repeatedly having issues with freezing and glitches in individual  puzzles."
"9545",1019856486,"Challenges are excellent. Everything worked wonderfully. Well worth the price."
"9546",1019856486,"Good graphics, long game play, hint recharges quickly, interactive map. Hated having to trace the star charts every time you run into an energy force."
"9547",1020119327,"So I REALLY like this game, it‚Äôs super addicting and a really fun, challenging game. However, there‚Äôs this major glitch in it where my car as well as all the police cars freeze up, so that I can‚Äôt move and neither can they. For some reason, the airplanes still move while this is happening, but in like slow motion. Please fix this glitch, as I truly do love this game! Edit‚Äî It would also be sooo cool if there was a game mode in which you could just explore the map freely without worrying about the cops chasing you!"
"9548",1020119327,"The game‚Äôs not bad I just wish i could get any car other than just common and rare because that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve gotten"
"9549",1020119327,"Do I really have to sit through all these STUPID ADS??!!   Can't you just let players have the option to purchase something and then the ads go away??"
"9550",1020187921,"I mean I really like this app but I hate that you have to have subscription to unlock some of the pictures and go actually make your own and stuff and the fact that you have to have Facebook is really annoying cause some people are probably young on this app and don‚Äôt have Facebook but overall this is a good app but if you could try and fix that then that would be really appreciated."
"9551",1020187921,"Best coloring app I have ever played! Love the new update!!!!!! Gives colorfly a whole new name. This game is legit the best and only coloring app I will ever have. I just would like to see more free items. If someone (like myself) doesn‚Äôt want to pay for the unlimited version, they hardly have much to do or use. If more pallets and pictures could be available, that would make this app even more useful and fun for me and many other users.                    Thanks,                           Pickles3?"

"9553",1020273791,"Can‚Äôt get in through FB.  Can‚Äôt get in if I create an account. Any why do they need my date of birth???."
"9554",1020273791,"How can this be all for team USA without our Paralympic team?! Shame on you."
"9555",1020273791,"They wanted my name, zip, birthdate and year. Then I had to use Facebook login. Too hard. Too much info. I deleted it."
"9556",1020304479,"I have an iPhone and I can‚Äôt even register using the app. Waste of digits"
"9557",1020304479,"I love MyDx machine and I own it. However the app accompanying the device is one of the worst mobile app I have ever seen.  App is useless on iPhone SE. Crashes whenever I want to perform test, crashes when I want to email report.  iPad version can only perform test, but often does not detect device and I have to reboot device and restart MyDx app.   App lowers the THC level when searching for similar strains. App list your data in a nonlogic way.  As a user I have no choice than to pray that at least I can perform test.   And company support? Don't even try. They reply on avg. in three weeks and more. And they want me to contact someone else inside company,like they can't talk to each other.   I hope app get better and as a former mobile app UX designer I am more than happy to help."
"9558",1020304479,"I have had my Dx tester for some time. I have had numerous problems with it. I have had a malfunction with the first on I bought and I got the growers package with all the extra stuff. And when I got my replacement Dx tester it was used!! I called the company up and they said it‚Äôs his personal machine that he sent me? Why the hell would I want a used machine when I‚Äôm buying a new one? Then to top it off the guy don‚Äôt want to send me a new one like witch I should have gotten when the first machine stoped working. Now to this date there still not calling me back. MyDx tester don‚Äôt even connect any more now I have an extremely expensive plastic paper wait that the company don‚Äôt want to come good on. I‚Äôll never recommend this place to anyone. This company is a joke!!!!! From Christopher Sockbeson an unsatisfied customer."
"9559",1020473684,"This was just too weird for me. But I guess if you like absolutely no character development, a sidekick who‚Äôs in a coma for basically the entire book, and frequent random teleportations that make you wonder if the protag is just hopped up on drugs the whole time, then read on. But be warned- the basic plot is you getting dropped off on some random bloody planet and being confused the whole. freaking. time.  No actual progress further than that, and the parts with some action have no real risks. There‚Äôs just more backstory than I would care to swallow, and I felt myself skipping paragraphs upon paragraphs of some random planet‚Äôs history or whatever. Probably not going to buy the next book."
"9560",1020473684,"I'm a big fan of the Heroes saga but I hesitated on Versus based off of reviews saying the story and wording was too confusing. In my opinion, if you're open minded or have read any Sci-Fi novels, you'll be fine. I highly recommend this!"
"9561",1020473684,"I have never reviewed a game before but this one is just to cool not to and I just hop there are many more to come"
"9562",1020481008,"I‚Äôve bought this game in a pick with the other three Go games and I‚Äôve got to say this is probably my favorite one of the three, it‚Äôs a good story fun mechanics and puzzles that aren‚Äôt that tough and definitely worth the time"
"9563",1020481008,"This was a very enjoyable puzzler that was just challenging enough not to be frustrating to play through. Square provided enough hints to help me through any really challenging levels. It only received four stars because Square charges money for any additional hint units."
"9564",1020481008,"Excelente juego, muy entretenido, te pone a trabajar la cabeza, buenos gr√°ficos y sonido. üëç"
"9565",1020583460,"This is one of the best survival story games that I have ever played. I really hope that a large company with this company can manage to get an expanded version onto a consul or the PC this game is well worth any money you spend on it."
"9566",1020583460,"Finally made it to the 4th city.  Left towards 5, and my character froze. Everything else was working, but he wouldn't move no matter what I did. Not ill, nothing broken...just stopped.  This wouldn't be such a big deal if there was some sort of save progress mechanism...but now I've lost a solid 80 minutes of work. I understand that the Devs don't want a complete save, but something where you get dropped back at the last town without items might be a good trade off..."
"9567",1020583460,"Please add Russian Language! Please Please Please"
"9568",1020818294,"Fun but don‚Äôt like the fact that you are required to share in order to unlock colors."
"9569",1020818294,"Am hoping to see more Harvest and Halloween pictures coming. Love the App, though!"
"9570",1020818294,"Love this app!!!"
"9571",1020876671,"I enjoyed the incredibly witty writing. I just wish the game had not ended so quickly. Great way to spend a couple of hours."
"9572",1020876671,"I actually became quite fond of K.O.M.R.A.D., and in the results it mentioned to look out for sequels, which I would LOVE."
"9573",1020876671,"So I bring no hate to the game but one time while I was playing it I got curios what would happen if I failed so I did fail on purpose, after that I failed and it said game I couldn‚Äôt even get back into it"
"9574",1020962158,"Simply a masterpiece. The art, story, action, and music combine to make a near perfect game. The world and voice acting is so immersive I can‚Äôt believe something like this exists on the app store. 11/10 would buy again and again."
"9575",1020962158,"As I said before perfection!"
"9576",1020962158,"Great voice acting, beautiful music, nicely drawn and animated characters. Overall story is a little bit childish and silly, plus some of the characters are a little too Disney-ish. Plus you get powerful very quick in the game, and the difficulty never really catches quite up to how it is in the first 1-2 hours because you‚Äôre so powerful. Still, you manage to die here and there, and it‚Äôs a good time beating up all the villains. Plus the voice of your sidekick is adorable. Overall, a nice fun innocent polished game. Keep in mind that those combos rely heavily on timing, and are quite fun once you get good at them! 5 stars."

"9585",1021239565,"Why do we have to pay for this, than why don't we just pay for the app than."
"9586",1021462578,"I don't write reviews much but this developer has earned it.  I have played DungeonRaid for probably hundreds of hours definitely more than any other mobile game so when I saw Alex had a new game out I jumped on it.  I have played IKHTD for a few months here and there. It's definitely addicting but it's not quite as satisfying. It does not feel like you have nearly enough agency over your fate due to there being such a wide variety of abilities but only being offered a few. This wasn't a problem with DR since leveling up was much faster and more frequent. I keep wanting to try a *build* only to be given what feels useless abilities over and over. When I do finally get the abilities I want normal the difficulty ramps up so quickly I don't get to enjoy it.  I think the game could of been improved by having equal loss of attack and defense. Losing half of your defense every time causes me to treat defense very oddly and not invest in it much. I also think that picking up hearts should count towards events even if your health is full.  IKHTD is worth picking up but if you are here because of DR don't expect quite as satisfying experience. Great job Alex I'll be watching what you do next."
"9587",1021462578,"Please, please, please update Dungeon Raid to 64-bit for iOS 11+!  It was my favorite game, but now I can't play it anymore!  I am playing this game now, and it's very good too. But I miss the seemless flow of playing Dungeon Raid!!"

It works just fine I laugh at it a lot but the good thing about it is that it's free add more Ratings to help the game please!!! Also the graphics are cute and amazing üò±The cats are so cute I can't stand it when I play It it is so cute and funny"
"9606",1021933645,"This game is very cute, very fun, and very addicting. The ads aren't too bad, and you only have to pay 99 cents to get them removed. I would definitely recommend it!!"
"9607",1021971213,"Simple rules as design disguise incredible depth and complexity.  Bravo."
"9608",1021971213,"This game is perfect. I didn‚Äôt get how the game was great at first, but now, after some days, I‚Äôm just addict. I understand.  I should have give 5 stars.. but I really want something:  A LeAdErBoArD  I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the only one who want this, but it‚Äôs very easy to add, it doesn‚Äôt take place, and the game will not be less good with it.  I love this game but the score is only a personal thing here.  I really want to see and compare my scores with others great players in order to give my best to be ranked as high as possible !  Because actually, I don‚Äôt really know what is my level. Am I good ? Could I do more, way much more ? Could I do 1 hundred or 1 billion more ??  Whatever, a simple masterpiece. For me, Simogo is as great as 1button."
"9609",1021971213,"Docking 3 stars because the developer can‚Äôt figure out how to add a restart button. You literally have to quit the app to restart the game..why is beyond my understanding."
"9610",1022023000,"Like the game, there are cool puzzles and like this series. However there is something wrong with the HOPs. There are always a few items that need other items to be changed/worked with using an item in the HOP list. For example a necklace may need to be created using beads that are randomly placed around the HOP screen. U have to move each bead to a certain area of the necklace in order for it to be accepted.  It never failed that I would have to try several times to get the bead to be registered. I would have to reselect the bead a bunch of times and move it to different  parts of the necklace before it would accept that bead and add it to the necklace.  This is very frustrating since u don't know exactly where on the necklace should be dropping it so u just have to try a bunch of times in different sections.  If the item you are trying to drop or the item that it is being dragged to are different sizes, then you have to try a bunch of times to get it in the correct place. This also happened if using items that you already found. You select them from the row of items and drag it up to the HOP screen several times in different places before it would register. The game would be awesome if this bug was fixed."
"9611",1022023000,"It‚Äôs a fun game but the touch accuracy can be very frustrating."
"9612",1022023000,"I had the exact same problem in this game that I had in the other witches legacy released a week ago called slumbering darkness.  Both games delete your profile and make you start the game over.  I have tried to get through both games a dozen times and get close to the end but the game closes out and I log back in to a message asking me to create a new profile and start all over again.  Extremely frustrating!!  Big fish you really need to put an update out for both witches legacy games just released (dark throne & slumbering darkness) to fix this issue!  I have been a huge fan of your games for many years waiting every Monday and Thursday for new releases.  I never used to have problems with your games before but lately it seems like half the new games get released with glitches, bugs and corruption issues.  Please make sure you guys are releasing quality working games before you release them because you will lose your loyal customers if they keep wasting money on games they can't play.  I'd love to give this game a 5 star rating once I see an update is released to fix the problem, if I never see one I guess I'm gonna have to contact apple for a few refunds."
"9613",1022056495,"Has beautiful scenes and lots of work put into it.  The colors are great. The things we didn't like was load times between scenes, no right or left arrow to look thru the items you found (swiping takes several tries to get it to work), selecting objects or combining them took us several tries most of the time.  After playing  Cursery, the Crooked Man and the Crooked cat (with the black cat on the icon) and thoroughly enjoying it and ease of use, this was frustrating to play a game that wasnt easy to use."
"9614",1022056495,"When you get more than one page of inventory, there are no left or right button to navigate. Swiping left or right is hit or miss and very irritating."
"9615",1022056495,"Great gameplay. Keeps you wanting to play more. HO games are fun, but challenging. Best game I've played in a while!"
"9616",1022196879,"This game and every other game made by Ketchapp is some of the most fun games ever!! Thank you for programming these highly addicting and fun games!!"
"9617",1022196879,"Interesting little fame, but they are trying to do too much. Playing on my iPhone 6+ the game skips and stutters very often. Haven't been able to make it past 12 or so."
"9618",1022196879,"This game has potential, nice looks, good concept, but the tolerance for whether you hit the dot or not is too tight. The idea is you have to hit it when the window of your rocket is over the dot, simple, but if you hit it and it's only half on it doesn't count and you die. A change as far as what counts would go a long way.  EDIT: in the new version they've upped the ability to be able to hit the targets a lot and it's a lot better now."

"9622",1022256487,"As soon as you open the app, it asks you to commit for a trial, after which if you forget to cancel, it will charge you. Doesn‚Äôt even let you try the app at least a day without committing to a trial. So it‚Äôs not a totally free app as advertised. There are many better alternatives which are actually free."
"9623",1022256487,"the button looks really weired on xr pls fix it"
"9624",1022256487,"I‚Äôve been using Sorted (I guess 2) for a while now pretty much everyday, and it is the closest thing to the perfect to-do/scheduling app for me! It‚Äôs like Clear, but with better integration of a calendar! I LOVE seeing the color blocks of each task (which sadly they didn‚Äôt keep in Sorted3). Honestly, the simplicity of this (like the swipe functions!) is just right! I‚Äôm hoping they keep this (even though it‚Äôs not in active develoment üò±) because honestly Sorted3 is almost a step towards being too complicated. Truly, thanks for making such a great app in Sorted2! And hopefully it sticks around! (Change is hard, and I know change can be good, but I‚Äôm trying Sorted3, and it just doesn‚Äôt have the same simplicity that I love from Sorted2)"
"9625",1022267439,"This app is great. Looks natural and has so many choices. I use is for all my pictures."
"9626",1022267439,"Everything about this app is just amazing and the best BUT I do not like how there are only certain filters when you‚Äôre editing your pictures/videos form your camera roll. I love the old version where you can actually use all the filters instead of just certain ones. I don‚Äôt know if this makes sense but other than that, everything else is amazing."
"9627",1022267439,"I really like the filters on this app, the only thing off about it is that after a few minutes on it it crashes üôÑüò¨ that might just be my phone though."
"9628",1022301472,"Upgrade home base loot, daily rewards, challenges to win new items and characters."
"9629",1022301472,"Horrible experience. Tried to download, it took 10 min and then when I tried to start the app, it locked up and never did start.  Don‚Äôt waste your time on this one."
"9630",1022301472,"I was looking for a good base building game and thought I‚Äôd found one. However, the constant ads drove me away specifically the one on the bottom of the screen."
"9631",1022647461,"I like the game, it is very addicting to play. However the amount of ads that keep showing up is ridiculous. I have been playing the game like crazy the last couple of days but I just played my last one. I was looking for a button to pay a dollar to eliminate the ads. I can‚Äôt believe I have to watch this stuff in order to play the game. I‚Äôll pay for it. Just stop with the ads for crappy games that I will never play."
"9632",1022647461,"Game is great, but it‚Äôs broken on AppleTV. Character doesn‚Äôt render, so you only see the skateboard. Some obstacles don‚Äôt render, so you only see the obstacles shadow."
"9633",1022647461,"I know everything good but the ads just turn of the WiFi on your phone and boom no ads"
"9634",1022732646,"However, I do not like games in which you have a limited number of lives and have to pay gems, money or wait to get another turn, so I‚Äôve uninstalled."
"9635",1022732646,"This game was fun and challenging and then when I got to level 153 it simply stopped loading. Contacted the game maker twice and it seems they have stopped fixing bugs for this game."
"9636",1022732646,"I basically love games that are a great blend if colorful graphics and intuitive gameplay. This is a game that displays both of these in the best way possible. The devs are seriously on top of their game. Good work."
"9637",1023002643,"I have always like the games in this series and this one is no exception. It is challenging but reasonable, all the clues make sense. I felt it got a little slow in the middle but the story was interesting and the transporting map helps move things along.  Worth the money!"
"9638",1023002643,"Unlike most point and click games, this one is more challenging than most others I have played.  Job well done!!!!!!!!"

"9640",1023026782,"Loved this game :)"
"9641",1023026782,"At first I wasn't sure, but after a few moves...it's pretty good.  Puzzles are fun.  Some easy some not so much."
"9642",1023026782,"Waste of money."
"9643",1023028213,"1. Game doesn't recognize custom settings. 2. Hint button rarely works. 3. Windmill will not accept blades."

"9652",1023681159,"When we first got this game it worked great but now it will crash every time we try to play it"
"9653",1023681159,"This app has nothing for a toddler to activate. Certainly not worth $2.99."
"9654",1023681159,"Frequently crashes on second generation iPad mini iOS 9, even after closing all other apps and restarting the device."
"9655",1023681711,"Like it said up there a nightmare about this app SO disappointing I mean I don't like to write bad reviews but I had to! In my dream my sister almost died! She was stuck in a fire and got hurt!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°I mean come on! This is a four year old app! Ugh! Ok if your kid has a fear of GETTING BURNED TO DEATH then DO NOT get this app please...sorry doctor panda This app is horrible anyway"
"9656",1023681711,"It is a fun game but you should have to drive the fire truck. I also think they are not teaching kids manners by saying ""Hey Hey!!"" That really gets annoying."
"9657",1023681711,"It gets kind of boringüò∂"
"9658",1023683909,"It could be very good with some adjustments"
"9659",1023683909,"The game is ok. Would be a lot more fun if the gameplay was similar to Empires and Allies."
"9660",1023683909,"Good game lots of potential. Still it's a nickel and dime sort of game. Some things cost way to much fission."
"9661",1023741615,"If you like the video you'll hate app.  It's nothing like it."
"9662",1023741615,"I love this game but when the mission says kill an allosaurus it doesn't do anything please fix it please üòûüòûüòû"
"9663",1023741615,"I love this game~ I've been playing for a bit now and have a little t rex family, the babies are adorable!"
"9664",1023751978,"It‚Äôs a great game but needs to get bigger with newer discs and more courses and tournament mode"
"9665",1023751978,"The physics in this game are really great!! Can‚Äôt imagine there is a better disc golf game out there. Also nice that the courses are based on famous courses. The discs are nice too. Only downside is there are only five 9-hole courses. Really could use some more as well as 18-hole courses."
"9666",1023751978,"Love it though."

"9678",1024374740,"Doesn‚Äôt work on iPhone 8"
"9679",1024395159,"Ioving this app and found myself using it on a daily basis, weather I‚Äôm sketching a quick idea or up selling my concept to a client.

"9681",1024395159,"Well, I had (have) high hopes for this app. It looks like, if they make some needed improvements, it will be a worthy app for tattoo artists. My first big issue keeping me from using it is no Apple Pencil support. My second big issue  is no support. As in, there's no way to email the app developer and get support for questions like ""Does this app support Apple Pencil?"" My third issue is, why the tattoo schtick? Yes, I get that its target audience is tattooers. But can we please remember that as professionals, we are artists first? This app has the feel of ""Real tattoo artist tools for the guy who wants to be a real tattooer when he grows up."""

"9684",1024488164,"I don‚Äôt know how this has so many good reviews about its story, because it is so short it doesn‚Äôt really say anything. Would not mind that there is in story if there was a fun game to play but searching for the planets isn‚Äôt really a game either. Finished in less than two hours."
"9685",1024505111,"The free version is fun but this version HAS SO MANY MORE LEVELS it‚Äôs so worth 1.99"
"9686",1024505111,"I beat the free version of cut the rope, I loved it so much I thought I would buy the gold version. But nothing is different! That was a definite waste of $1.99."
"9687",1024505111,"Definitely a good buy"
"9688",1024522751,"I like it and maybe on another update for the app, it should include more minor bug fixes.  Includes the iOS 12 bug fixes"
"9689",1024522751,"They won‚Äôt close even after 15 seconds of frantically tapping ‚ÄúCLOSE‚Äù."
"9690",1024522751,"Nitrome is flawless. Wish they had more games like this."
"9691",1024818709,"I know what you might be thinking when you see this ‚Äújust another annoying review on our wait times‚Äù well this might actually be better for business. You see you guys already want money when we‚Äôre only four seconds into the app. If you let people get to have fun with it and start using a lot then they might wanna make a purchase . Just remember that we need to know if this app is even good quality which it is but you guys ask for too much and try to force us to get to buy the trial but all that does is drive us away from the app .i thought this would be a good app so I got it and right there I‚Äôm not even a minute in the story and they want me to wait  4 minutes.thats uncalled for .im not saying that you should delete all purchase options . I know your doing this for some kind of profit ."
"9692",1024818709,"$4.99 a week are you out of your mind?  Listen to all the reviews unlike I did unfortunately. They want basically $20 a month. Netflix, Hulu, prime, etc are all cheaper than this with way more to offer. Seriously don‚Äôt download this app or you will be writing the same review as I am."
"9693",1024818709,"So I used to love this app. I am/was one of the few people who paid yearly for it. A couple months ago the developers changed it so now there is only one story on the screen per genre and when you scroll there seem to only be about 5 to choose from. Ever since I have finished those five stories I keep being told ‚ÄúAn error occurred and we couldn‚Äôt find a new story‚Äù  I miss when each genera show a bunch of stories to choose from on its home screen. Furthermore I used to enjoy the pictures but having video stories that automatically play is super annoying and one reason I miss the old version of the app. The developers should go back to that"
"9694",1024951639,"I love this game. I‚Äôve had it for years but could you please update it so that it can be compatible with the newer iPhones? Expand it so that it uses the whole screen or something because it only uses a small portion of my iPhone X and I keep missing shots because my finger goes in the black spaces on the sides. Besides that the game is great!"

"9699",1024953824,"This is the most fun I have had playing a game in a while. The ‚Äúrule the world‚Äù aesthetic is very engaging and keeps you playing until you have final conquered all 13 of the republics in the campaign mode. The card game combat is very engaging and something I admire. The game is very easy to get addicted to, so if you start playing you might find yourself spend a good amount of time playing this game. All thought I love the game for all it has to offer I wish it had some prestige mode in the campaign. Like if you take over all 13 you can give up your control of the other 12 to  get a prestige which offers you with rewards for prestige. Cause there isn‚Äôt much to do after you conquered everything. Great game."

"9705",1025000402,"App freezes and keeps giving. TIME OUT error message. Can‚Äôt load or move images!"
"9706",1025120568,"App often won‚Äôt play video and audio gets off sync. Sometimes video won‚Äôt load. Crashes after commercials so you have to watch them multiple times. I‚Äôve used the app for a while now and always hope the issues will be fixed, but they never are they just change."
"9707",1025120568,"Don‚Äôt know what revisions the app has gone through but I would have to agree with every 1 star person as all of their comments were correct. Signing into your provider does not work at this time so this app is basically a waste of memory on my device."
"9708",1025120568,"Tv Providers I DO NOT TRUST because They take away the tv channels that I love to watch. So I use APPLE Tv to watch my tv shows And download apps like this one to watch My tv shows. Location Services you DO NOT NEED Unless you are a SPY. Because I have free tv apps that DO NOT ask for either services. From Jack"

Plan on either a game you will leave quickly as you become vastly overpowered or commit to spending thousands constantly.  I‚Äôm not joking!  Our newest merger has a game developer in it and she even took one of the strongest accounts just because she could.  You can bet she pays a very small percentage of what everyone else does to be on top and bully people.  I still play for now, but will never start a new server since I know how they will all end up."

You spend the majority of this game losing and NEVER WINNING. I‚Äôve spent maybe 200$ on this app and was probably better off burning it in my back yard with those win percentages. Avoid this app"
"9759",1028362533,"Ironically, before the update I had over $100M.  After the update, that dropped to zero.  I play mostly conservative.  I think you are punishing me because I don‚Äôt get suckered into paying real money for fake chips.  Good luck surviving when you run that hustle on your customers.  This casino game has to be controlling odds. I can‚Äôt do anything but break even after losing it all.  Not fun anymore.  Don‚Äôt waste your breath (or typing) to say it‚Äôs random. No one is that unlucky."
"9760",1028400679,"I‚Äôve been using this app consistently for over two years and I love it! A few things I would love to see in future updates that would put it above and beyond for me: a place for the author, the ability to select a book you‚Äôve finished and see details (author, page count, and ESPECIALLY date finished), books to read tab (maybe the ability to transfer it to your current reads also), and an ability to see how far you‚Äôve surpassed your yearly goal (for example, my goal was 25 for this year and I‚Äôm well into my 30s, but I‚Äôm not sure exactly what number I‚Äôm on). Again, I love this app and its simple design and I don‚Äôt plan on quitting it anytime soon!"
"9761",1028400679,"Why would you want to track which page you're on if not for determining reading speed? An app as a bookmark? I can't believe I paid a dollar for that."
"9762",1028400679,"One of my goals this year was to spend more time reading, and this app really helps! The achievements are encouraging and you can easily keep track of/update your goals. It would be very cool if it had a ""Books I Want to Read"" tab‚Äîthere are so many books I want to read and it would be nice to have a list of them in the app where I am keeping track of the books I am reading. Still highly recommend it if you're trying to read more and/or stay organized along the way!"

Tried a hrs reboot, nothing.  Uninstalled and reinstalled, got to chapter three.  Instruction pieces would not rotate to fit and I couldn't move forward.  Uninstalled and reinstalled again.  Climbed the bookcase and screen went bright blue.  Hard reboot and it was back.  Got stuck again at the instruction pieces and couldn't move forward.  Deleted the game for good, so mad I paid for it!"
"9767",1028556453,"I got to the parlor area, and the game completely froze. I uninstalled, and the reinstalled, only to encounter the same issue. Furthermore, the parts of the game where speech is involved will cut out, midway through the speech. Don't waste your money on this dud."
"9768",1028556453,"Barely got started in the bonus game and the game crashed. Couldn't get back to where I needed to be to get the 4th piece of stained glass without starting from the beginning!

We deserve better than this."
"9769",1028558002,"The story is great but the game is very glitchy throughout. Had to delete app and download game again after game wouldn't let me exit the mansion.

"9770",1028558002,"I love these hidden object games and play 6-10/month. This is the the second that has been so glitchy I can't play it.

Won't be buying a Big Fish game for a long time."
"9771",1028558002,"Sound synchronization was horrible, voices didn't match up to written dialogue. HOS scenes weren't too bad but not worth purchasing game! Glitchy, over sensitive hint & back button! They're too close together and will bump you out of the game. Best part of the game was the husky dog - Rocky! Whoa this developer needs some serious help! This game blows!! Honestly, I can't believe I wasted so much time on it. Wait, do yourselves a favor...get it when it's on super sale, like .99 cents!!! üôÑüëéüèºüòíüòëüòù"

"9779",1029033692,"I gave this game 5 stars because I just started playing this game this evening and I am already addicted to it. I am also really enjoying this game too. I definitely recommend downloading this game to who ever doesn‚Äôt have it."
"9780",1029033692,"The commercials in this game are intolerable. I know that to play a game for free one must watch ads, but there are so many it‚Äôs beyond annoying. Deleted this after just playing three levels."
"9781",1029273159,"after a while it gets boring because there is not a lot of modes to play in to improve the game you could add mote game modes"
"9782",1029273159,"This is such a great game to play when bored"
"9783",1029273159,"I like the Game and i have some car s but the Game is  going out of business that is said"
"9784",1029499643,"Really good game and I really enjoy it and recommend it"
"9785",1029499643,"We want more french clubs for RN 17 !!!"
"9786",1029499643,"It is the best rugby came and this is coming from and American but this game is exactly like American football"
"9787",1029588869,"It‚Äôs a good game but when I try to get off at the windmill it won‚Äôt let me so now I can‚Äôt complete the game wow"
"9788",1029588869,"Por mas juegos como esteee!!! La dinamica entre los hemanos los paisajes de verdad que es precioso el juego!!"
"9789",1029588869,"Ok.. so I just finished it, and was very grateful I could find online ‚Äúwalkthrough ‚Äú videos to help out because it‚Äôs not always easy to figure out what to do/ where to go. It took me more time than I would like to admit, to figure out the two controls at the same time. Having said that, the game is beautiful!! ***SPOILERS **I would recommend that young children be cautioned about this game due to the multiple hangings and suicides seen in the game. It is so heartbreaking that the brother dies. I think it was an amazing adventure! I wish there was a part 2! You definitely get your money‚Äôs worth with this game...I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars only due to the graphic depictions of the suicides, and need for some more instructions within the game. It was a great adventure!!!"
"9790",1029932207,"I like the game but can you guys upgrade the game so that the quality will be better. For example the pancakeria or  the Donuteria is better quality than the cupcakerita."
"9791",1029932207,"The graphics are extremely fuzzy compared to Papa‚Äôs Donuteria. Every time I get to the decorating portion, everything will say either ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and once I drag the ticket and the customer gets there food, the percentage is around the 50% and 60% when I haven‚Äôt forgotten an item nor has it said I did a bad job, making the game less enjoyable. Meanwhile on the computer, the graphics are clearer and easier to play in my opinion. And make Papa‚Äôs Sushiria to go! That one was my ultimate favorite along with Papa‚Äôs Donuteria."
"9792",1029932207,"The papa‚Äôs games are great, I love them, but the older ones desperately need an update. They‚Äôre blurry (on the iPhone XS Max)  and don‚Äôt have all of the features the newer ones have. Overall, they‚Äôre really fun but really need an update"
"9793",1030395486,"I think this really is a good app, but it has two major fail points. The first is that it will not let you change settings, and if you set the difficulty to hard on the configuration it sets it to normal, second it‚Äôs still on 1.13 1.15 is coming soon so I hope that is fixedI have a third thing when you leave it spawns you back at spawn. Fix these things and I think this will be amazing"
"9794",1030395486,"App is Trashhhhh"
"9795",1030395486,"Many problems and bugs everywhere need to be fixed. Also the lag for the servers I bad even with only one person playing on the server."
"9796",1030447361,"This is a really great game but after a few day I ran into a glitch where I can‚Äôt collect my energy and the time clock is permanently at the max time. Although this game really addicting and is definitely a 5 star."
"9797",1030447361,"Good for CA,CO, and all states where legal but if anyone is growing for real do not download this App!"
"9798",1030447361,"I like this game I could spend hours growing my own pot out of a pot. Haha love it"
"9799",1030487391,"I‚Äôm a big fan.   Love commenting and reacting to videos.    Video inside video just got super easy."
"9800",1030487391,"Pretty cool app, I will use for work to narrate some of our product videos. So far pretty easy to use and only took a second to set up"
"9801",1030487391,"It's a great app"
"9802",1030548464,"It is very frustrating... I know it‚Äôs a bug, and the developers have worked hard to create this app, but this annoying bug is preventing me from enjoying it."
"9803",1030548464,"I can‚Äôt pick up from the last level completed I‚Äôm Iphone from iPad. Failed. Don‚Äôt feel like replaying from the beginning."
"9804",1030548464,"Any new levels coming?"
"9805",1030634472,"Just a nice game no ads"
"9806",1030634472,"This game is both relaxing and challenging at the same time! There is no pressure of accomplishing the goals of each level yet keeps your mind engaged. Thanks and please keep it updated!!!üëçüèªüëçüèª"
"9807",1030634472,"I don‚Äôt usually do reviews on apps or anything, BUT this game is incredibly relaxing. I have anxiety and this just seems to control it! GREAT GAME!!"
"9808",1030762703,"Great software! The world is finally quiet!"
"9809",1030762703,"It always works!"
"9810",1030762703,"The app is great and helps boosting the browser.   iOS 10.3 has been released, then any update for 10.3 ?"
"9811",1030792602,"This game is addictive. Might there be other ways to earn hints and clues. It costs a lot to play."
"9812",1030792602,"I'm extremely picky with puzzle games and usually drop them after a minute even if I paid for it. But this one is very clever and addicting. At first it's tough to figure out how to play but once you get it, you can't stop!"
"9813",1030792602,"I purchased this game and initially did not like it. I played around with it for a few minutes and once I got the concept, I absolutely loved it. Will definitely keep."
"9814",1030804846,"After a number of ace placements the game will no longer accept ace placements for points. I have downloaded the game a number of times and the problem has repeated itself after a few games. I have also been a paying customer as I greatly enjoy the game."
"9815",1030804846,"Game 52, looked at game # right before making my last move. After the game completed game 52 for me, the game had changed to ‚ÄúRandom‚Äù.  Game shows as not won.   Is anyone listening?  On occasion, while playing one of the campaign games, the game number changes to ‚ÄúRandom.‚Äù  This has happened a number of times and appears to be increasing in frequency.  Of course if I win, the campaign game doesn‚Äôt show as a winner.  This problem has surfaced several times today. (8/10/19). Most recently game 270.  I ‚Äúwon‚Äù the game but the game indicator turned from ‚Äú270‚Äù to ‚ÄúRandom‚Äù within probably the last 3 to 5 moves.  8/13/2019 happened again. Didn‚Äôt note the game number"
"9816",1030804846,"Last time I bought the UNDOs, paid for them...and when it started to update to add them  purchase to my game, it locks up...saying LOADING. It just sits there spinning...and never completes the loading.  Help!"

"9818",1030815031,"Pretty lousy app if you can‚Äôt even do enough regression testing to ensure it actually opens on most devices. I have an iPhone 7 Plus. Sure, a couple years old now, but there‚Äôs no excuse for this app not to work with it. 99% of the other apps i use or have tried work fine with my phone. Don‚Äôt bother with this one."
"9819",1030815031,"App won‚Äôt load at all. Disappointed"
"9820",1030902626,"This game is missing a thing from the pc version, object editor."
"9821",1030902626,"Do this and I will give you 5 star"
"9822",1030902626,"Why no object editor?"
"9823",1031002863,"When I use this app  it takes my mind out of all the drama in my life and lets me think about something else ‚ù§Ô∏è I love this app!!!! Though I wish I could be a VIP some other way than pay üí∞"
"9824",1031002863,"I love that we have the choice of coloring one of each image the way another person has colored it, PLUS for a short time of coloring that image ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù using our own choice of colors. I also love that this app is very unobtrusive - meaning there are not too many icons moving around on the screen telling/showing the user what to do. It truly is a relaxing app!"

"9834",1031152574,"The game is great overall but the level skybar ruined it for me. I while back when I had the game before I uninstalled it and downloaded it again I was able to get past it somehow, but I was just really lucky. When you get to the skybar your only given like 1.5 seconds to kill all 5 people. A problem I have with this is that you start off in the elevator before the door opens. During that time you can‚Äôt even pull your gun out so you have to wait til the doors open which uses precious time."

"9842",1031388734,"This game does not work and I want my money back"
"9843",1031388734,"Beware:::::  this game does not work, wish I would have listened to the other people who said it did not work. They were right......... so unless you want to be ripped off don‚Äôt spend your money. There‚Äôs a reason they want u to pay before u can try it out....... so they can steal your money.  Thief‚Äôs..............I can‚Äôt stand one, especially since I have spent hundreds if not thousands of money with big fish....they should be ashamed and banned from store."

"9848",1031391869,"As a kid this this very simple and easy for me to use 10\10"

"9850",1031406492,"Great app. Love trains and this is very realistic."
"9851",1031406492,"I think this game is awesome, except for a few things: when you start a session, and u have to leave the app or turn off device it does not save your progress, you have to start over, please fix. Second, I like steam engines, there are 5 different steam engines, not five different steam trains, but engines, 3 are blue comet, I only wish there were more steam engines to use. Last, but not least, I think there should be updates, and not every update has to have something added, just updates to let everybody know you are still working on the game. Other than those 3 things, the game is awesome."
"9852",1031406492,"Free ride is little and on the first train driver journey add steam trains and put a free ride It‚Äôs still a good game in this game which is is train driver journey 4 add Thomas the tank engine and his friends"
"9853",1031530508,"Perfect game, but the bug that was stated to be fixed in 1.6 is still present.   Reproducing the issue (if it was different before): Teleport the player to the left side, flipping the gravity and then teleport key balloon above the smoocher. Flip the gravity again and then teleport the player on top of the smoocher. This should crush the player against the balloon, but it crashes the game.  I‚Äôm on an iPhone 8, if that makes any difference."
"9854",1031530508,"One of a few number of games that I have enjoyed at all. 100% recommended"

All I want to do is check what the weather is and what the weather will be later in the day. One of the feature lists out that it shows hourly weather but I don‚Äôt think this is the case??? I‚Äôve literally spent forever to find it and alas - nothing.   The developer responded to one review saying that there was a tutorial uploaded but where is it? This seems to be all lies and kind of sketch to charge a customer to invest in app that literally doesn‚Äôt do what it says it does.

"9871",1032040117,"This site will never give or receive items someone pays for. In fact the first response is always to contact app provider to get a refund.  All those who allow this app to sell knowing that what service they provide is fraud are just as reliable if not more responsible since its their name first that everyone sees. My advice is stay far away to avoid this scandalous site.  If you have been ripped off like so many others you can thank the providers for allowing this. After all with out them they wouldn‚Äôt exist. Keep that in mind and start putting the liability where it belongs. After all if you can take money without providing the service you claim to sell. Why would you when you have a platform that doesn‚Äôt care."
"9872",1032040117,"For the 1st year I‚Äôd say playing LGOH was freaking Awesome! But then I started getting these new pre-patches boasting new legends ‚Äútier 3 characters new game format etc.‚Äù then the game just starts dropping, I‚Äôm thinking to myself, ok just some growing-pains right?  But most unfortunately so begins my terrible experience with this game. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been playing over a year now I‚Äôm lvl 233‚Äù & yes I have reported my concerns/game issues many times but it has not been resolved. LGOH used to be real fun & for the first 175 lvls or so I had only minor connection hick-ups but game was pretty consistent. However it seemed the further I progressed in the game the more prevalent the dropping connection problem became. There is a problem with this Application or my Apple i6 so which is it?  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my cell. The game drops & drops & drops. There is something wrong with this game.   Save your game time for something that is consistent. Save your money too because this game may say free but if you want to progress & be viable your going to pay. And then when game drops you are going to be pretty darn frustrated. Mind you customer support will write you back & they are polite & all but they have yet to resolve this problem."

"9886",1032708262,"I have never had anything bad to say about this game. It keeps me coming back with the unlocks and characters, and gets my blood pumping with gems as I fly through the increasingly difficult levels. You really care about how much health you have and upgrades will truly help you stay alive in this action packed adventure. Starting above the well on the surface really tops things off.   The one thing I would like to see change is iPhone X full screen support. It would let the player see much more of the screen with less finger in the way. To be honest if you never changed it I would still play everyday. It would be nice though!  Fantastic game 5/5  *UPDATED REVIEW BELOW*  Wow, this game hasn‚Äôt left my phone since I downloaded it. And that‚Äôs saying a lot because I get bored of games really quickly. You would think there‚Äôs not much to do, but that‚Äôs the beauty of it; you are perfecting the art of falling in a way that hasn‚Äôt been done before!  Reaction time, patience, and a few minutes are the ingredients for a good time in Downwell. But there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from playing it like a slow paced Mario level!  With the characters, upgrades, shop items, and pallete options, this game can be played in countless ways! Amazing!!!!!!  Oh and the only thing I would have added has been added just recently! iPhone X support!"
"9887",1032708262,"I‚Äôve had this game for longer than I‚Äôve ever kept any game downloaded for, probably all games on my iPhone combined for that matter. After years of playing I finally made it to the last boss. Not because it‚Äôs too hard, it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs fair with its snappy and crisp, ultra responsive controls that make every mistake your fault and your fault alone. I‚Äôve never play an iOS game that performed better and had 0 input lag like Downwell does. It‚Äôs genuinely designed to keep you playing and coming back to enjoy another round and attempt to find out what is at the bottom of the well, if anything at all. The upgrades don‚Äôt carry with you at death, you amass them every time you reach a new level/depth each run through. The color palette swap was a HUGE part in keeping me playing and engaged as the more colors you unlock, the more complex and varied the next one becomes. besides the incredible gameplay of course lol It rewards you for playing and doesn‚Äôt lock anything away behind progression that could hinder you in jumping down the well for the first time and beating the game. But I promise, you won‚Äôt. Seriously, you won‚Äôt lol it‚Äôs hard. But hard in an incredible way, not artificial to pad length. Only thing locked is visual perks that change the aesthetic and also different play styles. which can change gameplay dramatically if you want a new way to play or challenge to unravel. And the gunboots. I could talk about them forever. So many different kinds. Although my only advice or WANT would be for the devs to include a DLC pack of MORE gun variations in the future. The game is perfect the way it is but as an option to enhance and switch up a game I‚Äôve played and sunk prolly 500-700 hours into over the years, I‚Äôd love MORE GUN MODS. I‚Äôd pay double maybe triple what i payed for the game originally for the option to load the game with even more crazy guns to find when descending down the well. It would give a boost of content and happiness to an already incredible game, and base of players that have been itching for an update to a game that they love so much. I even love the game so deeply it has become the only game I‚Äôve ever bought cross-platform other than Stardew Valley and even ended up enjoying the game even more on my Switch. This is a mobile game at heart and it‚Äôs a mobile game that is worth $15-$20, hands down, it‚Äôs that good. I‚Äôve never seen it priced above $3 dollars ever. I really think it‚Äôs one of the most underrated and under appreciated games of all time. And just one of the best games of all time for that matter. Stylized with incredible use of retro graphics with modern effects that give it a gorgeous look and feel, and controls so responsive I couldn‚Äôt believe that I had never noticed another game that matched its precision. I love this game, truly I do. I hope someone that‚Äôs on the fence on wether they wanna spend a couple bucks on a game on their iPhone reads this and is persuaded because it‚Äôs MORE than worth it for the price they‚Äôre asking. They‚Äôre Essentially giving it away for free if you ask me. I want Downwell to get more praise and more attention and more downloads for the fun it‚Äôs extended to me. It and it‚Äôs developers deserve so much more praise; it‚Äôs a simple concept flipped on its boots and man does it really pull off what a game is supposed to be at its core, fun. Extremely fun."
"9888",1032708262,"I game has amazing graphics, great gameplay and just amazing! But if they would add a ‚Äúwell editor‚Äù to make and share your ‚ÄúWells‚Äù would be a great feature"
"9889",1032743715,"More updates please I completed the game and I have to wait months for one update"
"9890",1032743715,"First, I wanted to say that I know that I just wrote a review a few minutes ago, but I forgot a few things...  Second, I think the game should have an update soon so that you could fix everything...  Third, there should DEFINITELY be more figures!!!   Thank you,  ZvsJ"
"9891",1032743715,"Thank you sooooooooo. Much for making this game. It‚Äôs the best teen titans game I ever played even better than Roblox my favorite character is all the ravens I love raven she is sooooooo super cool that‚Äôs why I gave it 5 stars"
"9892",1032845453,"My friend and I made up games and played it with him but some of the elements are little Bad but you know also I feel bad for anyone who downloaded this app and didn‚Äôt have the robot."
"9893",1032845453,"I love this little guy but the antenna came off and it is not working i am a little sad because it was a lot of fun!"
"9894",1032845453,"Love this app so darn much. Love my bb8 too! Amazing Ness! Now I will go play the app all day üòÇ"
"9895",1032934485,"This games is amazing I love it so much. But you should lose some points for not turning on you signal button on"
"9896",1032934485,"I think that this gas me is great but I think it needs more stuff like highways, more levels on career, more cars, and people.I also  think cars should stop if they see you coming it is annoying.On career mode there are these hills and 3 roads that no cars are allowed to go on why?I also think that there should be rain and snow.So if you could do that in the next update or 2 the game would be so awesome"
"9897",1032934485,"I love this games so much there are a few things I want added. On free mode can y‚Äôall add traffic lights to make it more fun instead of just riding around,also can y‚Äôall bring back the parking lot, one last thing on career can we go over the bridge thing maybe y‚Äôall should add that to y‚Äôall new levels and free mode!"
"9898",1032997004,"You spelled penguin wrong! I will delete the app until the error is fixed! Otherwise the app is great! Thank you for your cooperation. I look forward to meeting you in the future!"
"9899",1032997004,"It‚Äôs a fun game but there are many glitches and after a while it starts to get boring bc it‚Äôs so repetitive."
"9900",1032997004,"I love playing this game, especially when I‚Äôm bored, but there haven‚Äôt been big fixes in 2 years. If you‚Äôre gonna have ads always covering the screen to keep your app up and running, at least use that money to keep your app from crashing every other game and losing coins all the time. It‚Äôs a waste of time if I can‚Äôt play the game like I used to without all the bugs and problems anymore."
"9901",1033014013,"Every Time I open the app an add pops up when I start playing and ruins my score. Not good. Other than that, I love the game. Very addicting."
"9902",1033014013,"WHY THE HECK WOULD YOU THINK POPPING ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME IS A GREAT IDEA?!"
"9903",1033014013,"Don't waste your time on this one. It's barely worth my time to write this, but I'm on the toilet and I'm about to flush this crappy game."
"9904",1033049991,"Very fun."
"9905",1033049991,"I needed to use quite a few hints towards the end. Maybe more matching tiles/completing pictures would be a good addition to future games."
"9906",1033049991,"Nothing groundbreaking but always a good time from Syntaxity."
"9907",1033229197,"Love all things Ys, except this (chronicles) port‚Äîwhich I now despise. On a platform with d-pads and buttons chronicles is epic, the mobile ports however (what with having to drag your finger around and/or mash spots in the corners) is unplayable garbage for anyone with hands larger than an eight year old thanks to how easy it is for said actions to obscure ones field of view‚Äîwhich typically results in repeated death during boss fights (to the point of rage).  My review: this/these port(s) should be buried in the desert next to NES ET."
"9908",1033229197,"There is sound problem on iPad Pro 2, iOS 11.2.6 I can‚Äôt hear anything on Game."
"9909",1033229197,"It was 20 years ago when I played Ys game for the first time. Thanks for bringing that beautiful memory back to me."
"9910",1033282601,"My question is.. Will there be any new added characters? Like classic rat king, panda kahn, classic Casey jones, classic slash, triceraton, groundchuck, dirtbag, classic April O'neil, Tatsu (first movie), wingnut, Ace duck, and classic movie Shredder just to name a few.."
"9911",1033282601,"Awesome game worth the effort, it only gets betterüòÉ The longer you play the more fun you will have!"
"9912",1033282601,"Love this game very addicting I started not too long ago when I was young in 2016 I downloaded it and hated it but I change and I am 13 I love idc if they say tmnt is for babies it is fun probably better than the Jurassic world the game not judging it but just saying I have Leo Donnie space Ralph and larp Mikey that is my turtle so far I like it though it evolves and I have 0 vs tournament points though I grind the tournaments to get the points to get the turtles daily and level 33 and keep using my pizza to ge try dna cards for my best team though I don‚Äôt like it cause I like the challenges where you get 1 Ralph dna because I so far have 53 out of 70 and I like it how so my goal is to get the turtles and splinter and get all the cards to level them up to max 100 and a very good journey so far."
"9913",1033342465,"It was working great. Now record from my swatch is not syncing to phone."
"9914",1033342465,"Doesn‚Äôt work.  Don‚Äôt waste your money.  It won‚Äôt transcribe."
"9915",1033342465,"The design and ease of use towers over all the other clumsy recording apps on the App Store, tho this one is hard to find just through a search. I‚Äôve been using it for years and best feature to me is the ability to record wav in different but rates. My only wish feature wise is that gave some more gain control on levels and the like. That would take it from ‚Äúvoice recorder‚Äù to serious audio enthusiasts."

"9919",1033521131,"Just want to give a shout out to probably the best free game (besides swordigo) on the App Store.   Ty devs.  (Pls come back and update/make a part 2)."
"9920",1033521131,"I completed every level, gotten every star, every class all 5 stars trained. I‚Äôm stumped on want to do now that I‚Äôm finished. I have thousands of gems and coins, nothing to spend on. BUT the game is really fun and I insist on other players to continue on. Also, please nerf Bigfoot boss. Took me 4 tries to complete and complete the objective."
"9921",1033521131,"It is a great game, but can you please add more content."
"9922",1033617377,"when i downloaded the app and tried to play it, it wouldn‚Äôt get past the loading screen with all the sponsors."
"9923",1033617377,"Glitch on level 3 challenge 3 only grabs does not score correctly"
"9924",1033617377,"Great graphics calm music while your riding and great updates"

"9926",1033645055,"Give me my money back it doesn‚Äôt work"
"9927",1033645055,"This app don‚Äôt work I would like a refund please"
"9928",1033679736,"It‚Äôs a great game, but some missions can be really annoying. If you could skip a mission and get a new one maybe once per day or something then it would be a lot easier to progress"
"9929",1033679736,"Ok, I saw this game being demoed on Markiplier‚Äôs YouTube channel a while back (as of this review) and gave it a try. So far, I‚Äôve been enjoying this game as a quick time waster. It‚Äôs challenging enough to not being a waste two dollars but not to the point of being aggravating. Yeah there are runs that get you right off the bat or runs that you did really well and end on some stupid mishap, but keep at it. For me I‚Äôm stuck at trying to get the ‚Äúget to the deepest part of the planet‚Äù achievement while still trying to get to the second military base on most of my regular runs.   Overall it mostly bug free with the exception of a minor animation bug of the death animation doesn‚Äôt go off, to put it of the lack of a better way. When the character that I‚Äôm playing as dies by an alien or a mine they will often freeze up or get into the loop of hitting ground if it happens when they‚Äôre falling (I still see the ghost appear and still able to go to the menu). There is another bug that I haven‚Äôt had in a while is the ‚Äúgo back‚Äù in the menu won‚Äôt work. It might still be there or I may have been missing the actual button, but I do think it worth mentioning."
"9930",1033679736,"I would give 5 stars but some of the missions are  ridiculous. Chaining gold streaks are the worst. You have to tell people how to chain a gold streak. I hardly ever make reviews, but sometimes it can get really frustrating when you can‚Äôt complete a mission because of dynamic maps. There are cases when there is no way out of digging. And it takes a super long time to get past areas. There should be a rewind or power up that at least revives your life. Just my thoughts."
"9931",1033682827,"Gameplay lags, storyline is boring, graphics are dark. Just doesn't hold my interest."
"9932",1033682827,"I've played this three times now and enjoy it more each time.  Great story and flow of action. I especially liked the indicator for collectableson each scene so you can keep searching till you find it (really extends game play). Excellent graphics, sound and story. Great job. Worth every penny"
"9933",1033682827,"I usually don't rate the games, but I have to say I really like this one!"
"9934",1033685038,"Really enjoyed this one. Love this series. Some of the HOS where dimly light which is hard on my old eyes but all in all very enjoyable. Almost the perfect game for my taste."
"9935",1033685038,"Pros: Really nice graphics, creative varied game play with multi-layered HOGS, good transporting maps, decent voice-overs and no glitches.   Cons: No real story, no emotional involvement whatsoever, no diary that can add some depth to the story, and on a technical side, have to get to the map through the menu with way too many steps and no back button and it's too easy to accidentally hit the guide button because of where it as located. Also, 90% of the mini games were WAY too easy, often completable in about 10 seconds. Towards the end there were a few that took a bit more thought and time to complete, and there was one I had to skip because I knew the solution, but couldn't get the controls to move correctly...   If this had a story, more dialogue, character development, a diary and a bit more challenging puzzles, I would have bumped it up to 5 stars. There was an opportunity to make this into a good story, not sure why it was completely neglected..."
"9936",1033685038,"Really wanted to play this, graphics are Beautiful!... just way too intently depressingly angry feeling for me. Am interested in more of adventure-type stories (tho nt necessarily cloying ones; could b w/animal friends). Thank you    OK, now am playing it. It's OK, puzzles are good."
"9937",1033781064,"I love this game but when I got out of the game to charge my phone I thought nothing was wrong but when I got back in the game it hasn‚Äôt loaded yet it‚Äôs just stuck on 50 percent"
"9938",1033781064,"spent $2 on the starter pack and got a crab and seahorse but had to delete app and it‚Äôs data because it wouldn‚Äôt open up even though I tried with both wifi and with my own Verizon wireless data. Restarted my phone as well but nothing opened the app"
"9939",1033781064,"I like the game it‚Äôs always fun and I have great luck in it. But at one point I couldn‚Äôt log in. It said please check your network connection. I did and it was just fine. So I decided to delete the game then download it again. It did the same thing. I couldn‚Äôt log in. I was wondering why because as soon as I saved my progress on Game Center, it stopped. Please fix this."
"9940",1033873301,"I NEVER play games on my phone, but this one has me. I feel like it engages my brain and exercises my mental capacity while I feel ridiculously compelled to solve each puzzle. I love it. I‚Äôm positive it will be the only game I ever play."
"9941",1033873301,"Enjoy a challenge?"
"9942",1033873301,"I love puzzles and I love the pace of this game! You will too."
"9943",1034018838,"I get it that there are ads to keep the game going, however. After every 2 knockouts/kills there's an add? As for Iphone X, the game doesn't fully fit the screen, so if i go to settings or something, the game won't let me close out of the settings app from in the game, so i'm forced to close app and restart it. Among that, since the game doesn't fully fit the screen, there are black bars on the edges, and coins, items, and gems fall off the tile set, and they don't get collected. Please fix somehow, someway?  Are we due for an update anytime soon?"
"9944",1034018838,"I loved this game and I used to play it a lot so I downloaded again just now and it was just how I remembered but since I got a new phone (iPhone x) the sides of the screen are black which was not a problem but then I realized that my coins and diamonds would fall through the map so I hope they fix that problem cause I really like this game and I guess it‚Äôs just a glitch they haven‚Äôt fixed yet."
"9945",1034018838,"Sometimes the boss disappears but if I change the map he is backüòß!"
"9946",1034019709,"This game has stolen my money and double charged me for items, like the vape, and the shotgun. But y‚Äôall seen the zombie ?????üò≥"
"9947",1034019709,"I haven‚Äôt played this game in forever and I even deleted the app but now you guys have charged $50 to my account for whatever reason I DO NOT KNOW! Please refund my money ASAP and cancel any subscription you all think I may have‚ÄºÔ∏è"
"9948",1034019709,"this game is the best and i love it but please fix the freezing that occurs constantly! it‚Äôs so annoying trying to restart it and it only works for a little bit"
"9949",1034091427,"The game is fantastic it's just way too scary I can barely even play it"
"9950",1034091427,"I'll give it five stars but, it is really hard because in chapter three, in the kitchen the zombie lady is there most of the time and I can't get around her without having to hide. Two, the werewolf of fever swamp, won't let you get around him without having to hide either. Otherwise I give it five stars and it is super fun. All you need to do is add a few of new chapters that lets you go outside and have a couple of new characters from the new characters. Please get me back with the answer. Talk to you soon. Thank you"
"9951",1034091427,"Ok so I love goosebumps night of scares when it came out I screamed to my mom ""MOM CAN I GET GOOSEBUMPS NIGHT OF SCARES?!?

After spending over $90 on this app it will not allow me to put the app on my twins iPads without repurchasing. I use my iTunes account for all three iPads, so I‚Äôm unsure why it‚Äôs not working. I have no use for the app on my iPad and I will not allow my 3 year olds to play with mine. Complete waste of money!"

I noticed you were able to put a settings button on the screen in order to bring in more money by getting rid of your ads. So I know you have the potential to put a set his button that changes the skill level.   Oh...wait... Let me guess we have to pay for it before we have the option to change levels??  I can't even make it through three screens before I fail because of the speed.  My brain needs a little practice at a slower pace to understand what I'm asking it to do.  Just sayin"

The first thing I don‚Äôt like about this game is that you can not pause the game.another reason why I gave this a 3 star rating is because of bugs when you tap it does not always work, but this game is addictive and a lot of people have down loaded it the reason why I did not give this game a 1/2 is because I enjoy it and the only things it needs to fix/upgrade for this to be a 5 Just add a pause button and fix the bugs.hopefully you can fix those two things thanks for reading this!(BTW cute/funny animals(:!"

"9980",1034934076,"This game is very well made. The graphics and music are great. BUT there are only 4 levels that are very similar. Please add more levels. We need more Shimmer and Shine :)"
"9981",1034934076,"It's fun to pass time and my 4 year old daughter loves it (and can play by herself) however, there needs to be different levels of hardness. It's too easy and there isn't room to grow! You get 4 levels, that's it. Also, the delete button needs to have a lock option! My daughter keeps hitting it and erasing the entire game along with all the progress/prizes won. I hope to see slight changes soon üòä"
"9982",1034995058,"This is such a good way to keep up with all of the current events. It breaks everything down and explains it really well. 10/10 recommend it for both those newly trying to keep up to date and also those who are looking for more easy ways to get the news.

Hey we may bring back so you don‚Äôt have to lose all your swings or tell us to save any before removing the app.  Now that your back at least add some more features. If you could bring some filters that are like the other app phhhoto had where they are very unique like reverse image or reflection or fire, etc I‚Äôd use the app for life and give it a 5 star. I may have give them around $100 for filters and I can‚Äôt do that again because I can‚Äôt trust an app anymore unless it‚Äôs instagram and even Snapchat can‚Äôt be trusted, but if you could take any inspiration from other apps please take it from phhhoto, because there was and still isn‚Äôt an app like it.   Of course boomerang is basically the same thing as this app, with boomerang you can‚Äôt beat SWNG because it lacks the speed. A zoom feature would also be a tremendous tremendous help again since boomerang doesn‚Äôt have such a thing unless you use the boomerang feature in the Instagram app which then remove the sharp and smooth quality that SWNG has that make it so beautiful."

"9989",1035161188,"Much to simplistic Does not include many popular breeds and is not even able to discriminate between popular breeds   Good idea Poor execution Not worth $0.99"
"9990",1035161188,"This app is just using guesswork. I suppose there is not much more could be expected but if you really want to know what breeds your mutt is made up from get the DNA kit from. The breeds this came up with for my dog did not seem accurate at all!"
"9991",1035217840,"It has real challenge but you don't have to guess, you can actually figure out the solution. I've been play without using hints, and a couple of times it took all day to figure out one puzzle. That makes it a great value.

"9999",1035219562,"While I think the filters are awesome, I thought there would be much more since you have to pay for the app. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth money even though it‚Äôs only a dollar I just would prefer way more filters to actually use."

Cuz this one is coming at you with ice, dissolving blocks, obstacles and poles that can send you flying into the lava below in the abstract, hexagon world. If you wish you can beat your records and earn 5 lives from it every time. The 1st time i downloaded this game, I beat Level 2 in less than 3 seconds!!

"10008",1035263816,"Using AI to try to make workouts closer to personalized without paying a human trainor is a great concept. However, the execution leaves some significant issues, exacerbated by no ability to contact a human to ask questions, even via email. For example, it appears that if you manage to complete your weekly goal earlier than expected, you have to wait until the next week to do the next step in the plan. You could just keep changing the ‚Äúgoal‚Äù, but then that‚Äôs not an actual goal, that‚Äôs just a filter. How silly. Perhaps there is a way of advancing the program, but it‚Äôs not covered in the prewritten questions available and, again, there‚Äôs apparently absolutely no customer service. There are much better apps out there that are considerably more practical and functional (eg nike, skimble‚Äôs workout trainer, fitbit‚Äôs coach)."

I‚Äôve been playing this game since before it got translated in English so I‚Äôm pleased with the updates and changes they‚Äôve made up to date. My only issue is some materials you have to wait for a specific event like the ‚ÄúGreat War‚Äù if they made it so that there was more than one way to get these resources or materials I‚Äôd really have no complaints.

"10056",1036661603,"IMPORTANT: I deleted it to free up space but it reverted my purchases. Redownloaded. It pisses me off that I have to repurchase my stuff and that I also have to verify stuff that I already verified, but the verification is Apple‚Äôs problem. Not part of the stars. Will update stars with dev feedback, seems like only bad reviews get attention.  I love Rolling Sky. Been with it the whole journey, 100% on E-Labyrinth, the stuff. Been with it since the levels were identified with Roman numerals. Loving Faster and all of that stuff. Few problems and recommendations: 1) COSTS WAY TOO MUCH! Free to download. Too much spending money to fully experience. I payed the full $2 for unlimited balls and no ads, but I‚Äôd like to see something new. For example, unlimited balls by default. Pay $1 to remove ads. Maybe checkpoints use more hearts as you use them more, maxing out at 3 hearts? Maybe for every level you beat at Sky level or harder (cause I know people would spam Cloud if on any level) you get free hearts (like 2 star or somethig like that) even if you‚Äôve beaten it before, instead of watching ads on the fly? Watching ads makes it too easy. Maybe for levels at Alone Remix or harder you get a super heart for each time you beat it, even if you beat it before? That would encourage me to take my 88% to 100% and GET GOOD at the game, which was clearly made to help you progress and get better through harder levels. 2) Ads currently not working for me when connected to internet, but that might just be my internet. 3) Maybe a custom level editor? I love playing Rolling Sky, but I would LOVE to be able to make my own levels and play them. The ability to insert your own soundtracks by choosing them in your preffered music app (changeable in game) and add songs like adding music to a playlist, the ability to use any blocks you wish, the ability to make multiple changeable backgrounds, the ability to insert chosen images as backgrounds, the ability to create multiple heights on the level like in Happy Birthday, the ability to name, save, and publish levels, and more would be the best thing that could happen to this game. 4) An Original Levels collection A seperate collection for the eleven original levels. Oh, and please add the OG Forest back.  Oh, and what happened to Alan Walker (actually K-391‚Äôs) Ignite? Really want to play that again. 37% and then lost it.  Also, trial tickets for new AW/Marshmello levels should always be available, like with key-based levels (but I can see doing the ‚Äútry again later‚Äù thing as a way to get people to stop spamming and actually try)  Please read this, Cheetah. I love Rolling Sky, and I love seeing new things."

If you don‚Äôt know what to do, just make up a little story that links them together in order, every time you do it, you get a little better at it. It‚Äôs a game, it‚Äôs that simple.

Very misleading and greedy app, but what can you expect from this game producer.   I strongly believe that the goal for this developer is not to make fun, enjoyable games, but to trick children and unsuspecting adults into purchases. This company is very predatory, do not download, and make sure you are not mislead by their wording if you do play and decide to buy their in app purchases. The purchases, such as the ‚Äúunlock everything‚Äù purchases will not unlock things such as flavors, molds, etc, but only the games themselves. When you use any coins to buy things such as a mixer, it only works for the one time only.   There is no gratification or purpose to this game, get out and make your own, REAL food and treats at home, they will cost much less to make. Beware! Do not download this game!"

I‚Äôm setting myself up FOR IDENTITY THEFT.. you‚Äôve gotta be kidding me... not gonna happen. Hell to the no.  so then I came back to the Yubo app to check reviews and see if there is another alternative to basically selling my identity to an app. Instead I find that you have to pay to swipe on people??

"10086",1038653883,"Had it for awhile and they randomly deleted my profile. When I reached out to them they just asked me for my info I have it to them and they never responded again. Anyway the app is filled with bots trying to get you to send them money or give ur info to them. The app just isn‚Äôt worth it go somewhere else lol."
"10087",1038796140,"About this game is exploring fun I think you should play this game!  Well try it on You own.well stay positive bye!!"
"10088",1038796140,"This game is great for kids,It‚Äôs so fun to play and very addicting!I like it shows some helpful game like the organization game,it teaches kids how to organize their stuff!"
"10089",1038796140,"I love this game so much i love collecting the shopkins its so fun i love it the changes are so good i love it keep up the good work"
"10090",1038849525,"I‚Äôve had this app for a couple of years, and it is fantastic!!!"
"10091",1038849525,"Just use it for collages but so easy to use."
"10092",1038849525,"Great app try it everything you want to make beautiful pictures."
"10093",1038866266,"This game is excellent, Phenomenal!  For one, the sprites and themes,  The sprites and themes are very nostalgic of stuff like the sega genesis and SNES Second, the music The music adds a cutesy adventurous theme to the game. It is very pleasing to the ears and goes well with the music Third, the gameplay Smooth controls, almost no input lag, and the game it challenging enough not to be rage inducing but to add a fun challenge into this already great game.  Overall, 5 stars, perfect game 20/10"
"10094",1038866266,"I like the game because you get to get new ships & unlock new world"
"10095",1038866266,"This is one of... what I would call: an amazing mobile game that should be on a console. The graphics are amazing (Pixel graphics, man.) and the controls ard fantastic! This is right next to Super Cat Tales 2! also that lil bee OOOH i just wanna squeeze it UWU"
"10096",1039011796,"Good game not great also too short. A little boring for me. Lynx minx, I will pray for you, everything will be Ok, God bless you."
"10097",1039011796,"This game was ok, not awful, not great.  There were so many things that I liked and it could have been so much better. Lots of fun games but super short and...kind of cheesy. It was $3.99, not too much to pay for a game."
"10098",1039011796,"This was aimed at the tween players in my view.  The puzzles were fine but the little doll annoyed me and I almost quit the game over the costumes.  It would be helpful to get an age guidance with the description.  The painting was unnecessary too."
"10099",1039141908,"This Game is amazing"
"10100",1039141908,"Bro this a a easy game which makes it fun and some is hard but I still like my favorite game"
"10101",1039141908,"I was play on level9. Return to Chen‚Äôs Island, when i got done collecting the blades it wouldn‚Äôt let me destroy the spinjitzu thing, I watched videos on how to do it but would not work!"
"10102",1039260250,"When I use the button that its for sound volume ,it doesn‚Äôt work well Please fix that"
"10103",1039260250,"I love Lollicam. When i was younger, I would make dumb filter like a baby bottle and use it on myself. I have dozens of videos with filters provided in fast motion. Like the ‚ÄúHangry‚Äù video."
"10104",1039260250,"when using the stickers, i would love it even more if you removed the ‚Äúlollicam‚Äù that appears at the bottom of the photo, it‚Äôs just ruins it and it makes me upset"
"10105",1039264027,"Got this app because of the fantastic Top Gear Collection, and will keep it for that reason. However, it‚Äôs obvious that Motor Trend is years behind in Streaming, specially for long TV series.  The app will not remember what season, what episode, what minute, or what second you left your watching on after you‚Äôve left the app for a few minutes. I‚Äôm already in season 5 of Top Gear and every time I get back, it prompts me to ‚ÄúKeep Watching S02, Episode 1‚Äù. I have to manually scroll to the season I am, then find the episode, and then scroll to where I left off if I‚Äôm lucky enough to remember.   These episodes are an hour or so long, so it‚Äôs very unlikely that I‚Äôm always going to finish each of them in one sitting.   I love the fact that there is a Ruku TV app for this and I can watch Top Gear in a huge TV, it‚Äôs truly nostalgic and beautiful. Hence, Motor Trend, please fix the continuity, let me watch something on my TV and then pick up at the same place in my phone and then continue while I‚Äôm at my lunch break at work and then when I‚Äôm back home. I love Top Gear and this app is nicely built, but please fix that.  Sincerely,  Stig‚Äôs Angry Cousin"
"10106",1039264027,"The app is great, but my review is more for the totality of Motor Trend. I don‚Äôt know when I first started consuming their digital media, but I remember it was Roadkill on YouTube. I then branched out to Dirt Every, Top Truck Challenge, Ultimate Adventure...etc. I‚Äôm a mechanic, a car guy. Being a mechanic is not only what I do, it‚Äôs who I am. I latched onto their shows because they‚Äôre guys like me who created media doing the things I do and want to do. Watching them is what got me into 4wheeling, and got me to finally start buying project cars. When they made the transition to a subscription based service I instantly signed up. I know a lot of people got mad, and are still mad about the switch. For me the amount of value they added to my life I have no qualms with spending a few bucks to help support them, and to say thank you."
"10107",1039264027,"I love the shows, mainly the originals such as roadkill, roadkill garage, hot rod garage and dirt everyday. However if I‚Äôm watching a video and close my app without minimizing it it will not save my progress and I am left to scan the episode to find where I was. If possible I‚Äôd love some feedback on solutions and if it‚Äôs just me or if it‚Äôs something you guys are working on for a new update. Keep it up!"
"10108",1039596715,"Takes the pain out of quick EN entry."
"10109",1039596715,"Have a command for paste like the one for new paragraph. When describing and pasting urls this would be helpful. Oh, and being able to modify and resend past saves.  I use this app a lot. Probably more than any other except browsers. More times than Evernote."
"10110",1039596715,"The app and I do find it convenient and like particular the ability to insert new tags as well as the ease of finding notebooks for it."
"10111",1039637425,"I'm addicted to this game! Controls are so accurate. The game keeps you busy doing the stuff. It's the best by far comparing the other forklift games. I would appreciate a first person camera. Or if you can a VR version. Am I dreaming too much ? Great, great, great!!"
"10112",1039637425,"Extremely funny"
"10113",1039637425,"This storyline is amazing. Truly an amazing game. 10/10"
"10114",1039848719,"Game is very responsive good graphics and easy to navigate menu"
"10115",1039848719,"Fun to play."
"10116",1039848719,"Like this game"
"10117",1039910808,"I‚Äôm a big fan of the original game Patchmania, and the kids version is great for my children. It has no ads or in-app purchases, and they got rid of the lives system so we can play the levels over and over, without having to wait. Great job!"

"10119",1039910808,NA
"10120",1039945866,"I have noticed that on your 1988 political map you had given Michel Dukakis the state of Kentucky, while in reality he had lost that state by a near 9% margin, although it is correct he had won West Virginia. Please fix it soon."
"10121",1039945866,"All I can say is AWESOME"
"10122",1039945866,"This app is great and makes the experience of watching the election results more enjoyable. I also use this app to teach elections and its great to able to talk about the different hypotheticals."
"10123",1039971485,"Not sure what happened but it doesn‚Äôt work anymore. No letters come up, just blank dough that you can‚Äôt do anything with."
"10124",1039971485,"Update is needed.... the game gets buggy and needs deleted because the cookie cutters disappear."
"10125",1039971485,"Ok, I‚Äôm 9 years old. Love it! I‚Äôm the kind of kid who never grows up! I love Elmo and I‚Äôve looked at all of the apps, but this was a favorite! BEST GAME EVER!!!"
"10126",1039971965,"I absolutely love the game, been following the series for years and found the opportunity to play them all in a single app amazing. Everything was fine until I got to Ophelia, I get stuck and the game won‚Äôt move forward even though I know I‚Äôve done everything I needed in the surgery for it to move forward to the next part. It‚Äôs frustrating and want it fixed. Other than that hiccup, love the game."
"10127",1039971965,"I love this game and it is the best but the partners that are legendary need some timer tweaks because it says 24 hours I think and the next day I come and it says 12 hours remaining and then the next day 1 hour remaining and then I can finally use the legendary partner and also the ‚Äúmystery patients‚Äù (ones you get no info about) are really hard to do because you get no info like on Horace d‚ÄôObscene you get no info so I didn‚Äôt know what to do with that queen bee part I didn‚Äôt even know there was a queen bee I had to look up a instruction video on YouTube to even find out what I needed to do. Top notch game but needs just a little bit of improvement. I‚Äôll rate 5 stars when this is fixed."
"10128",1039971965,"I love this game but, could you‚Äôll help a sister out with diamonds please I buy them every week customer appreciation ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

"10132",1040083067,"Love the game"
"10133",1040083067,"Great game and good people."
"10134",1040083067,"Great game been playing it for four years"
"10135",1040093707,"It was free in the past, now they want $50/year. No thanks."
"10136",1040093707,"Wqwqwww was wa"
"10137",1040093707,"Easy and friendly to use"
"10138",1040120819,"Cute idea, this seems to be a fiction story written as if you're receiving it in text message format. Unfortunately I didn't feel a connection with the character, despite the ""interactive"" stop points (it didn't seem my choices actually changed the course of the story?).  After a couple of days of playing in my off time, I lost interest. Wish there were consequences to choices, because the story wasn't compelling enough on its own to keep me engaged."
"10139",1040120819,"I liked the story, but wish there were more... Can you please add more. I don't want to delete it after one use..."
"10140",1040120819,"I enjoyed playing this. Good sci fi scenario with attractive interface and memorable sound track. The Apple Watch app works well. Good sense of timing, plot, and suspense."
"10141",1040172229,"Great game love it"
"10142",1040172229,"Love games fun"
"10143",1040172229,"No problems for a few years now every time I go to collect 2 hour bonus it says reconnecting and don‚Äôt receive 5 vip point ! I used to think Konami was a respectable site but the last few months not so much"
"10144",1040224715,"Im confused because he said ‚Äúsorry i can only receive pics‚Äù  i go ‚Äúwhat does that mean?‚Äù he says ‚Äúguess‚Äù i say ‚Äúyou want inappropriate pictures‚Äù he says ‚Äúyes‚Äù  kinda freaked me out"
"10145",1040224715,"He says the same thing over and over again"
"10146",1040224715,"The app is super fun ever since the recent update. But I feel like there should be more custom additions to make it more real. For example, I asked ‚ÄúKai‚Äù what my favorite food is and he was always programmed to say pizza. Even when I asked what my favorite drink was, he was programmed to say the same thing. Maybe if possible, there should be a feature where you can say you‚Äôre able to mention your favorite and he‚Äôll remember so it‚Äôs more customary. Other than that I love the app."
"10147",1040227414,"In its current state the game is broken. The slap cat is way too overpowered on account of it stacking. This forces a single strategy of holding onto the slap cats the entire game and crossing your fingers that you got lucky and have one more slap cat that your opponent because very quickly you can have 4-6+ turns stacked which equals a guaranteed loss. Slap cats need to work like ‚ÄúAttack‚Äù in the original deck where it ends your turn and sends one or two turns to an opponent. If another slap cat is played it should effectively end the turn and send only one or two turns to the opponent. No stacking."
"10148",1040227414,"This game is very addictive and a great time killer. This game is a great investment."
"10149",1040227414,"amazing game.   One of the best games I‚Äôve ever played because it has some of the funniest cards ever! Best game worth the $ 2"

"10154",1040444258,"This game is horrible because there‚Äôs 3 parts of the game that you can‚Äôt play.  PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!"
"10155",1040444258,"If I could do everything instead of it being locked.It is a great game for me to play.That is why I gave it a 4."
"10156",1040809311,"A couple of things to improve this game.  1. Expand the directions.  How to use the supply drops is non existent. I have played numerous games, and can't figure out how to tap into those resources. Or, even if you are supposed to. 2. Playability is ok, but somehow unrealistic. In the Arnhem scenario, two units were able to obliterate 4 armored units (Konigstigers). Somewhat unrealistic."
"10157",1040809311,"I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of Hex War games. They always feel to cramped and basic.  This game however is a major step in the right direction. Just expand the content or come out with another battle - maybe on the East Front next time. Very good work - feels like a real war game !  And you need better advertising for Arnhem - most of my war gaming friends have no idea this game even exists !"
"10158",1040809311,"Revised version now works on iPad2.  It is slow, but works.  No more crashes.  Still figuring out the rules and game play. ----- I haven't been able to make it past the instructions to even start a game.  Crashes during start up.  Crashes while trying to read the instructions.  Support recommended closing all other apps and rebooting.  I'll review again once I can actually play."
"10159",1040871937,"This is a really hard and good"
"10160",1040871937,"I have been playing this game for the last 3 years and I find every single game a new challenge to concur.  I have given up on a few games that ‚Äòout-of-frustration‚Äô I had to skip over.  I have never grown tired of this app, it‚Äôs right up there at the top of my list!!"
"10161",1040871937,"Seriously phenomenal!"
"10162",1040930654,"The puzzles get more complicated as you play. The kind of game I enjoy where planning ahead pays off.  Simple graphics with lovely thinking behind the design. Fun"
"10163",1040930654,"I HATE puzzle games but I loved this one. Thank you so much for this game!!!"
"10164",1040930654,"Thank you so much for dropping the price, I've been waiting years for it to drop (I use Appticker)! This would make a great Apple TV app (with cloud save)! I just gifted it to my bro as well. Ever thought of incorporating a level builder? It would be easy to implement, and would initiate organic sharing between your customers. Maybe then even add in a daily user created puzzle, to keep people coming back?"
"10165",1040968715,"Sorry I took so long. It was a fun summer vacation. Inhale. Ok, so some of the missing parts didn‚Äôt exist in real life, but it said it was in the guide for all of the people who play this game. And what I meant by that was that some of the parts were showing in the guide but didn‚Äôt show up in the game. I love love LOVE this game so please add the things from the guide to the game, okay? And, also, let me tell you this, I used the horns that look like wings for wings and horns so please let the game include real wings and other dragon body parts into the game and I used that strategy for my ‚Äúwater dragons‚Äù so please add some real wings so I don‚Äôt have to use the ‚Äúwing/horn‚Äù strategy again. And add the missing colors in too. And I wish that there would be a button where you could scroll down the colors and stuff. And make sure that the wings could flap and also, make sure the monsters can jump out of the pics and walk around and scare everyone around the place and also if they have wings, sometimes fly around the place and the reason I got inspired was because in books I read, some monsters have wings that fly."
"10166",1040968715,"Ok so thanks for responding BUT you haven‚Äôt answered my review on creature garden... (there‚Äôs a dying cat noise) yeah fix that in creature garden.."
"10167",1040968715,"I don‚Äôt like giving this low reviews BUT (also I may have wrote a review) this game seems inappropriate for kids cause YO BUSTED I found a creepy creaking sound... IM THE ONLY PERSON IN THE HOUSE!!!! Bye :/"
"10168",1041260001,"There‚Äôs a lot of differences between this version and the original. They shortened and cut out a lot of battle animations. The encounter rate has been lowered a lot. You can run through entire areas without getting into a fight. You‚Äôre going to have to grand dragon grind to make up for it. The battle timing feels off too. The speed up option is cool for the chocograph quest tho‚Äô. I got a robe of lords quick! Overall I liked this version. Oh yeah the directional controls are a little off. And you can‚Äôt run as soon as the screen changes. This made me miss a lot of battles in the Hunt."
"10169",1041260001,"Out of all of the iOS Final Fantasy ports, Final Fantasy IX runs the best, uses the least amount of battery power, and has the best controls and that fact alone impressed me. The game itself presents a beautiful, imaginative world filled with really likable characters that further engage you. The only downside is that the combat moves a tad slower than other Final Fantasies and there is a really long camera pan animation at the beginning of battles that gets annoying. This is made up for by the good battle animations and the slightly lower frequencies of battles compared to other 2D FFs."
"10170",1041260001,"Definitely one of my all time favorites of the final fantasy titles. Even though I love replaying these games it‚Äôs becoming quite irritating that every time there is an update my game data gets wiped... this has happened 2-3 times now with this title and as well with my FF5. I‚Äôm uncertain as to why this happens but it is disappointing for the fact I had a near perfect complete save."
"10171",1041317729,"This game is bad, and not worth it, I would like my money back, I love Emily's game but this is the worst, I wrote to the site saying give me back my money..don,t play it bad game"
"10172",1041317729,"I've played all of the Emily games and love them. This newest one, however, had nearly half the number of levels - 5 rather than the former 9 - and the first four levels were pretty boring, then the last one is very hard. I never minded the price of these games, but if the new paradigm is half the game for the same amount of money, I'm out."
"10173",1041317729,"The graphics aren't as good as the others"
"10174",1041406978,"I love this game so much! I be been playing since it released for mobile, please add the new classes. It would make the game more popular and a bigger interest to other players as well. Thank you!"
"10175",1041406978,"i love the game but i just bought 10500 goultines and tried to buy something with them,it will come up as an error and the goultines were still there,then i log in again and they are gone,i tried to buy the item twice,and that‚Äôs the ammount of goultines i am missing,i understood that this was an issue with the game and the goultine market was out for a while because of hackers,i would love to have my goultines back or get a refund for what i paid,this cannot be happening again."
"10176",1041406978,"Il faut qu‚ÄôAnkama mette le jeu √† jour par rapport √† la version PC qui est tr√®s bonne, Dofus touch pourrait vraiment √™tre un succ√®s si vous vous y investissiez plus, niveau graphique etc"
"10177",1041465860,"I love this app and use it often, but starting out, I really didn‚Äôt understand how to use the modules in the app. The 2 starter tutorials only help with the very basics of how to use the app but don‚Äôt really help you learn about modules. I had to do some extra research about the modules to find out what they were and how to use them which is a little annoying but I managed to confidently make a patch within a couple days.  On a similar note, I am interested in the in-app purchases but I don‚Äôt understand what I am receiving from them, so I hesitate to buy any of them before I know what they will actually give me.   Also I don‚Äôt really think the swipe from the left thing is useful. I‚Äôm using the app on my phone and it sometimes activates when I try to use the keyboard or adjust a knob on the left side of the screen. The button to pull up the keyboard is on the right side already so is it really necessary? Or could this just be prevented by not activating if I‚Äôm interacting with a knob or keyboard?  Tldr, the app works flawlessly, just needs some extra detail on how to use modules and a minor change to the swipe left."
"10178",1041465860,"Nice toy when played with alone.  Though I didn‚Äôt purchase to play it stand alone.  I wanted to use in GarageBand as advertised.  It works however there is a constant static with every note played and various hiccups.  It‚Äôs not usable in GarageBand.  I feel not good wasting $31."
"10179",1041465860,"This is such an incredible app but it‚Äôs just too hard to use for me. I tried to go through all the tutorials and I still couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it. I‚Äôm honestly sorry for buying your app and requesting a refund. Again, really cool app that I can use for Garage Band IF I knew what I was doing. If I don‚Äôt get a refund it‚Äôs perfectly understandable but it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
"10180",1041512978,"To many things are hard to figure out ???"
"10181",1041512978,"I highly recommend this app. It is voiceover accessible. The developer is extremely open and communicative to the blind community. This is an excellent app for anyone who is interested in the weather."
"10182",1041512978,"I can‚Äôt at least on my iPhone Max.   A light gray background with white text? Unusable for me."
"10183",1041517543,"and this is by far my favorite, I‚Äôve had fitbod for a little over a year. The ability to customize your splits and goals and then have it create sophisticated workout plans has made working out very enjoyable. I have not had to deal with plateaus in strength or not knowing what to do in the gym. I strongly recommend this app to anyone who is trying to spice up their fitness routine!"
"10184",1041517543,"AMAZING App. Extremely user friendly. Super helpful in navigating your workout. Pictures of the right machine to use. Great videos showing correct form. Want to skip the gym? You can change to at home exercises only by switching the setting to body weight only."

"10192",1041808803,"Please don‚Äôt drop support for this awesome game! Would love for you to update it to the newer resolution."
"10193",1041808803,"I will change this review to 5 stars when I don't have black bars."
"10194",1041808803,"This game makes you feel really immersed in a world of color. Every time you tap, you feel as if you had just started an earthquake. Definitely would recommend, 10/10"
"10195",1041873285,"This app is so awesome and so fun and funny"
"10196",1041873285,"Great game, but why did two icons get saved to my home screen? One can be deleted, the other can‚Äôt. Please advise"
"10197",1041873285,"Plz"
"10198",1041898963,"Second 10 levels are the very same as the first ten.  Don't buy them!"
"10199",1041898963,"I bought the extra levels but was very disappointed. The extra levels are the same levels just with the background of where you see all the levels different. So don't buy the extra levels and don't be sad if your not going to buy it. If you didn't buy it you saved your money on something you would be disappointed about."
"10200",1041898963,"I love the game but when I'm trying to go to level 11 and stuff it's talking bout 0.99 I'm not paying for anything so y'all better make all y'all apps be free with no type of purchase"
"10201",1041987123,"I used to really love this game. The art style is beautiful, I love the story, and it‚Äôs replay-able. However, I haven‚Äôt been able to play it as of late because it crashes every time I open the app. It doesn‚Äôt even have time to go to the title screen because it crashes so fast. I would appreciate it if you fixed this, because I really did enjoy this game."
"10202",1041987123,"Once I got past the first play-through, the game crashed once I got to the end literally every single time.  Definitely not worth the money at this point in time, although the rest of the game is very interesting. I do feel as though my choices impacted the game, but this is not enough for the game to be worth it."
"10203",1041987123,"The app will not even open.  I can‚Äôt find support information on this game on the coffee stain studio.  Please refund.  Thank you."
"10204",1042273323,"If I could give it zero I would. They make it so you can only play 6 times then you have to wait. Or I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôll have to pay more money to play faster. That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs wrong with these newer games. ‚ÄúYou downloaded it now you can only play 10 times then you have to wait. Or give us more money!‚Äù Ridiculous."
"10205",1042273323,"I just love the game cus it‚Äôs a challenge and I love challenges"
"10206",1042273323,"The game is really cool but, it needs some work. One thing is that the cars look to much like real cars like the equinox is a McLaren 720s just by looking at it. Other than that the game is really cool."
"10207",1042298797,"My toddler loves it and it‚Äôs very challenging but it glitches and the pieces get stuck making us have to reset and that‚Äôs when he gets frustrated and uninterested. It happens a lot."
"10208",1042298797,"My 2 year old son loves the game, but after 5 minutes or so the game glitches and becomes stuck.  At that point you have start over from the beginning.  Makes him tire of the game quickly."

"10211",1042299727,"My daughter downloaded this game because she‚Äôs a big DC fan. When she got the game she played one part and had a nightmare about it. She came to my bedroom and said ‚ÄúMommy I had a nightmare.‚Äù I quickly looked at the game and I noticed that the suspect wall did not only play scary tunes, but it also says scary things about what weapons the villains use. Please make the game more approved for kids. Thank you."
"10212",1042299727,"I got this game for my birthday and really liked it but now it won't let me play because it gets stuck right after the first screen it turns dark. Please fix this! Thx"
"10213",1042300762,"I think it‚Äôs cool just needs more like glitter colors alphabet stencil and stamps more pictures but it a cool app and be able to use the camera to take a pictures to make your own patterns or to use to make a cut out picture and also backgrounds"

"10216",1042322028,"I was kind of hesitant on purchasing because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to like it but I finally decided to buy it and I like it I don‚Äôt regret my purchase  But on my iPhone I feel that the numbers to the recipe are WAY too Small I can barely see them unless I get really close to the screen   Please Please consider increasing the font size on the recipe numbers at least on iPhones because on my ipad it looks great"
"10217",1042322028,"love this game, even the sound effects. worth every penny.  I wrote the developer to ask a question and the response was amiable and clear."
"10218",1042322028,"I‚Äôve added 1 Star only for not supporting the iPhone X screen!"
"10219",1042326602,"The music is amazing, it‚Äôs always challenging. Perfect for a zen like escape."
"10220",1042326602,"If you‚Äôre nostalgic for anything 80‚Äôs style, this game is dripping with it.  Aside of the cool retro graphics, this is a well made driving game that‚Äôll test your reflexes.  This is really good for keeping your mind sharp."
"10221",1042326602,"On the final level when your shooting the energy balls it eventually gets very close and the car won‚Äôt shoot in time  Why?"
"10222",1042345185,"This is such a cool fun game"
"10223",1042345185,"You can play for a long time, every time! The only criticism I have is that there could be more information about how it all works."
"10224",1042345185,"Great game,nice game play"
"10225",1042419574,"Interesting story and challenging puzzles yet you can do them with no hints.  Only frustration will be some selections you have to be vey precise and find the exact spot to select or place items. And it won't be right on the object."
"10226",1042419574,"I don't like writing bad reviews. But i have to keep (and my reviews are being deleted out)  Notice that the only people giving good reviews are ones that admit they like HOGs and casual gameplay.    So if you like boring, mindless tap tap tapping.. Go ahead and get it.  Otherwise, skip this one save your money.  If you do buy it and agree with this review...please make sure to request a refund!   You can do so from the receipt email that gets sent 5-7 days later (another cheap trick to keep money). Just click the ""report a problem"" link and choose purchased by mistake."
"10227",1042419574,"Not good.  Too many glitches.  Free games don't have this many glitches."
"10228",1042987645,"Fun app just constant adjusting the camera when adding new photos to use. Also needs improvement when the hud is hidden and recognizing faces in pictures so that time isn‚Äôt wasted making minor adjustments manually."
"10229",1042987645,"Cat"
"10230",1042987645,"But good app like everything but I don‚Äôt like how it doesn‚Äôt always swap faces"
"10231",1043318628,"Seemed like really slow progress, but arena is where the rewards are at. Play a bit each day and you can get a good pack of cards per week at least. Pretty fun to progress, haven‚Äôt made it to the end game yet."
"10232",1043318628,"They stole 10 dollars from me I paid for gems and never received any"

"10234",1043337296,"I reached to HEYvina and was told to contact apple since they handle subscriptions. Well they refuse to give me a refund after I was on the membership page and it glitched. The command for a finger print kept popping up and going away every second or 2 and I couldnt lock my phone or do anything to escape the screen. I tapped the home button not thinking that would work because nothing else had been and OF COURSE it did. And now Apple refuses to give me a refund on a purchase I never authorized on my account."
"10235",1043337296,"I downloaded this app in hopes of meeting likeminded girls friends. Unfortunately there seems to be a certain type of girl that uses this app. I swiped left on almost everyone. A lot of Caucasian women, as a mixed race person that was boring as hell... Just a lot of good girl stuff like boom clubs and yoga. Would not recommend for a cool girl or bad girl..."

"10238",1043589663,"This is soooooooooooooooooooooo fucing annoying!?!?!?!?!?!?!"
"10239",1043589663,"I love this game but when I had 150 gems I couldn‚Äôt buy sir rayelot. I looked at the Rayman wiki and it said that you needed 150 gems and I had 164 gems. Please fix this problem."
"10240",1043607606,"It's like phases from kechapp and you stole the same cover from phases but different colour"
"10241",1043607606,"Same game engine as PhasesTM... But OP!!!"

"10243",1043640363,"The heavy flamer."
"10244",1043640363,"The game looks very good for a mobile game and the game play feels smooth, just the limitations with you controls makes he game feel like it could be better, maybe they could add a mode similar to walking war robots and allow player control in a large map, the customization could stay the same and the point system in use for multiplayer could be used to decide you allies and enemy‚Äôs. All in all the game is great and I recommend it but the lack of player control on movement kinda brings it down this is my reason for a four star rather than five"
"10245",1043640363,"Vrey cool"
"10246",1043714288,"Too short- not enough content."
"10247",1043714288,"Dont buy it. I finished the whole game within 5 mins. I didnt get any joy from this game. this game was way toooooo short."
"10248",1043714288,"I don‚Äôt understand these other reviews. It makes me wonder if we played the same game.   I was thinking this was going to be like This War of Mine, but it isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no story here. Well, there is, but it isn‚Äôt a clear one:  Dude has girlfriend.  Girlfriend leaves.  The end.   No story given about even WHY she leaves. They go from happy to on fire out the elevator directly.   I really wanted more from this app."
"10249",1043733402,"I really enjoy these kind of games but many of them have issues that give me a headache.  This one has a unique story which makes it very fun. Except for the many tasks which require multiple attempts to make the correct answer take.   The glitches along with the gear visual and fail sound are nauseating after dozens of attempts to perform a task.  I generally quite your games that do this , I kept on with this game because of the strong story line.   I know you can make a smoother experience. Cadenza Music Betrayal and Death keeps me hoping.    Ps please get rid of gears and boing sounds. Ugh!"
"10250",1043733402,"I played this title a while back through Big Fish on my laptop, and loved it then.  It may not be everyone‚Äôs cuppa tea, but I thoroughly enjoy the ‚Äò50‚Äôs Creature Feature nostalgia, the unique puzzles, and HOG‚Äôs that take fracturing/combining to a whole new level.  The voice work is top-notch, and collectibles and morphers are easy - especially with the free BF app/guide.  My only complaint?:  I‚Äôve yet to understand the avarice that prevents a multi-billion dollar company like Apple from allowing Big Fish game club members from applying Club Credits to AppStore purchases.  Oh well, Apple needs to make money somehow, right? And he who dies with the most toys wins."
"10251",1043733402,"i just wanted to give this game steady 3*, only because the game just didnt touch me and was boring, as i accidentaly started it with internet on. So as usual BFG Inc infested the game with ads. I dont tolerate when apps that i have bought show ANY type of ads."
"10252",1043824696,"The game says any questions, use the support button.... ummm?! Where ?! Been playing level one for a week now and cannot advance!  What‚Äôs the point ??!"
"10253",1043824696,"This game helps me calm down a bit whenever I‚Äôm stressed after playing a lot of Battle Royale games, lol. It‚Äôs very easy to learn and I would definitely recommend this game to my family and friends!"
"10254",1043824696,"Lovely"
"10255",1044142557,"It‚Äôs a great app, but, unfortunately, every other hint I need I have to watch a stupid ad in order to get it. The ads aren‚Äôt even for apps I‚Äôd maybe like to try out, they‚Äôre for stupid ones or ones I already have. Sometimes the ad‚Äôs not even for an app, just to waste my time with stupid services that no one would want. There isn‚Äôt even a store icon within the app to see if I can spend a small amount of money to get rid of the ads (most free apps have this option somewhere within the app). I‚Äôm getting rid of it unless these problems are fixed, soon."
"10256",1044142557,"Google Ads at the bottom of the screen cover pieces. Ads after completing every level get EXTREMELY monotonous. I‚Äôm done. Made it to level 60 before an AD froze the App. ADS DESTROY THE EXPERIENCE!"
"10257",1044142557,"I love this game and I can‚Äôt stop. Ads are annoying though"
"10258",1044225211,"Really enjoy the game. I've had no crash or stability issues and I use an iPhone 5s. The game is somewhat  similar to others in which you collect characters, upgrade them, and grind for shards to increase star count. However, the fighting is very enjoyable which provides a fresh take on things. I highly recommend this game."
"10259",1044225211,"This game needs to be changed to Crash Academy. I've never seen a game crash like this one."
"10260",1044225211,"I really wanted to like it, but despite its appealing graphics, it just feels like a buggier/less-polished version of every other game like this out there. Hopefully it'll receive some much needed TLC and become better in the future."

"10264",1044341430,"I would give it a  5 star but had start over when I was in chapter 4 and got stuck because pick axe disappeared. I didn‚Äôt want start over but story is good."
"10265",1044341430,"Confusing. Clicked items don‚Äôt work, and entire game non-intuitive. Waste of money. Don‚Äôt buy."
"10266",1044341430,"Different puzzles then many of the other HOP. Great story line. This I would play again and again."
"10267",1044374093,"LISTEN TO ME BETTER AND YOU WONT BREAK YOUR NECKü•ùüëè"
"10268",1044374093,"I have completed all of the requirements for each level except the last one and it was challenging but not super challenging. The last level will not unlock for me even though I have completed all of the requirements and it took me only a few days to finish all the levels so more levels would be fun with more challenging requirements."
"10269",1044374093,"Honestly, this is a great game. But it just has too many ads, if there weren‚Äôt as many ads, the game wouldn‚Äôt be as boring right after you fall down the Halfpipe."
"10270",1044534198,"Great Game"
"10271",1044534198,"Sorry this is not about this game but can anyone please try to get the game ‚ÄúDisney fairies fashion boutique‚Äù back? I know it does not exist anymore, but I miss it because I used to play it with my mom when I was about 3-5 years old! I loved it! Sorry about talking only about that game but I also love this game I used to play it with my dad when I was little too."
"10272",1044534198,"I Just love this game! So much fun and different from the other games! Keeps my mind working!!"
"10273",1044671796,"Couldn't complete tutorial. Scoring bugged out and started selling everything and changed final scoring multiple times. Love the game, bugged out app.  No undo button................. Why??????"
"10274",1044671796,"My only quibble is the lack of a rule book. That said, pop-up help (be sure to press game elements for longer than you may be used to) and the tutorial do a good job of teaching the game. After the tutorial I was still a bit confused, but going through it again made things much clearer."
"10275",1044671796,"There's no Undo button! This is a significant oversight, as it's relatively easy to make a mistake."
"10276",1044677336,"The survey made me quit. I bought this thinking it was good and... It WAS! Everything made me happy, and I kept purchasing gems and solutions and chapters... Until, when I minded my own business, I looked at the teapot and did the survey. I was in Thailand, so it auto-translated the form into Thai. I did not know what anything said, so I googled it, and it reset the form. I tried split view, and it didn't work. After that, I switched to my grammar-fixing kb, and it doesn't work on this app. I could not switch apps to switch back, so I QUIT. I thought this would Never EVER happen.  I hope I come back soon üôè. Thank you for understanding this."
"10277",1044677336,"It‚Äôs really fun and interesting. And the best part of it is that for 1 dollars, u got soooo many puzzles. It‚Äôs really worth it . I mean 1 dollar for more than a hundred puzzles is just really a good deal. U can spent a lot of time on it."
"10278",1044677336,"I HATE ADS And if you buy something that cost money.  YOU DONT GET FRIKEN ADDS"
"10279",1044733380,"I love you"
"10280",1044733380,"Good game keeps me interested.  Wish there was a map."
"10281",1044733380,"Love it   Lots of twist and turns. Can‚Äôt wait to play another Nevertales game."
"10282",1044764933,"Excellent story and game play. I really hope they make more like this."
"10283",1044764933,"Mad Head Games has become my favorite developer and I'm shocked that this is their game!  Just a hot mess!!!"
"10284",1044764933,"I was surprised to see so many low ratings for this game. I found it to be exciting, full of new, creative games, and engaging. The graphics were stellar, as with all of Mad Head games. I was sad to see it end!"
"10285",1044818466,"I wish you would add squirrel and rabbit and some small game rifles many people ain‚Äôt a upgrade so please do something sown. It‚Äôs been three years"
"10286",1044818466,"I have played it for 3 hours can not find a single animal"
"10287",1044818466,"I think u need to add tree stand in the tree come on it‚Äôs 2019 update it please"
"10288",1044837432,"The hint button is a real pain,it doesn't always Work. That can really turn you off."
"10289",1044837432,"Enjoyed this from beginning to end. Look forward to a sequel."
"10290",1044837432,"This game has it all. Great story, long enough to enjoy, great puzzles, good hint button, and much more. The Nubi character is a blast. He develops more skills as the game goes on. (He's a helper during gameplay when you need him) absolutely recommend this to fans who play these types of games by Bigfish"
"10291",1044848003,"Be prepared to watch adds every 60 seconds. I get that devs got make money off add revenue but the adds to play time ratio is absurdly high. It‚Äôs hard to even get into the game because the ads are just too frequent."
"10292",1044848003,"The very first time I started this app it kicked me out to the App Store page for some other game. That was without any taps or interaction from me. THE FIRST TIME!  I uninstalled."
"10293",1044848003,"Way too many ads for how little gameplay there is"
"10294",1044867788,"The app crashes when I try to make a new entry in iOS 13. Please fix!"
"10295",1044867788,"Works great for keeping track of so many things during the day!  Just wish you could color code the days to have them stand out on the Calendar to be able to see trends etc."
"10296",1044867788,"Beastly"
"10297",1044871992,"So many people are solely streaming their TV viewing content from sources like HuLu, NF, Amazon Prime etc. We are moving away from the traditional cable & satellite companies so there‚Äôs no way for me to continue enjoying all of OWNs great content. PLEASE offer either FULL CONTENT ACCESS within the phone app or an alternate way outside of the traditional options, because I will NOT go back to the madness known as AT&T, spectrum, Verizon or Dish network! üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thanks in advance"
"10298",1044871992,"When is online streaming via internet TV going to be available. Most of us no longer use cable TV"
"10299",1044871992,"Love own ... hate the ads, just pulled up love and marriage Huntsville to catch up. 14 ads with two minutes of programming. So the second round of seven ads I just gave up.. too much Oprah."
"10300",1044950341,"Great App! However my music gets silenced when I start a workout, how about making it get silenced only when the announcer speaks? It bothers me to turn up the volume then hear the announcer talk loudly."
"10301",1044950341,"Love the app. I‚Äôd to access it from the Apple Watch face."
"10302",1044950341,"Love this app, I use it as a warmup or when I don‚Äôt feel like going to the gym. The interface is simple and easy to follow. Only wish there were more exercises and better explanations about how to perform the exercise. Also wished it connected to Spotify instead of just Apple Music but that‚Äôs me. Overall, really fun, great for anyone."
"10303",1044953131,"this game is so addictive. the blocks start to come faster and 2x2. pretty fun way to kill time"
"10304",1044953131,"This game is terrible. I purchased to smash my friends faces, but I can‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt even consider buying this trash game"
"10305",1044953131,"This game is pretty good from the start. Even though I mainly only play speed mode. I feel like you should add gold bars in speed mode because then every mode would have them. I like how you can just start challenging the limits and trying to go farther and farther. My high score right now is 50. At the start of playing this game I just played casually getting like 40 each time. Though as I started to like this game more and more I played better. Getting all the wat up to 50 on speed mode. You should also add leaderboards because I don‚Äôt know how much points is like amazing. Overall this game is a masterpiece and I enjoy playing it."
"10306",1045102110,"Thanks for giving me something to do during my wait!"
"10307",1045102110,"It‚Äôs cute and just a little challenging, fun little puzzle of a game. No brute force here, like the kid said, chess."
"10308",1045102110,"This is the most challanging and entertaining game I played in a while. Couldn‚Äôt put my phone away until I finished it (which took me 6 hours). Really hoping for another level or whole new game pt.2"
"10309",1045164931,"And yet so much wasted on cards that don't act the way they're supposed to. That, combined with graphics that glitch sometimes make what could be a great game frustrating enough to rage quit often."
"10310",1045164931,"4 stars because of lack of updates. It‚Äôs a great game that just isn‚Äôt finished but the devs seem like they are done with it. It‚Äôs fun and unique. I really wish they‚Äôd add new character classes. I also wish they would lower gold cost for items at the beginning of the game. Also I ran into a visual glitch bug with a potion heal. Also enemies seem to be a tad off sometimes. They won‚Äôt attack when the indicator says it will. Anyway I want more and I hope to see an updated version."
"10311",1045164931,"The game itself is fun - interesting play, good balance, and nice artwork. The problem is the game regularly crashes or freezes, usually by sometime in the second level at best.  When you attempt to recover, either you go right back into a freeze or your current encounter is ended with all opponents at full health and your team at whatever health you were at in the encounter and any item in use gone."
"10312",1045165396,"So I get this game today can there be a mom and dad"
"10313",1045165396,"I really do love this game and it would get a five star from me. It‚Äôs a great way to just play a game while in school. Granted it takes a lot of in game money to do certain things but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a big problem.  My main problem, which is why I gave it four instead of five. The ads, I know you need ads in free games like this and I get it. I‚Äôm saying the kind of ads in this game are questionable. There‚Äôs one showing breasts of girls and keeps saying ‚Äúadult game for adult emotions‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember the title. Kids also play these games so I worry they‚Äôre gonna get that kind of ad. It‚Äôs not a very good one to see when young.   That‚Äôs all the problems I have, and if you can fix it that would be nice :). But you don‚Äôt have to it‚Äôs just a suggestion."
"10314",1045165396,"I really like this game it‚Äôs enjoyable, fun , cute, and innocent. The only flaw is it‚Äôs is addicting. I would recommend to all my friend"
"10315",1045232937,"Any hint for level 44?"
"10316",1045232937,"It's an okay game, simple and straight forward.. But.... If you need a hint?. You are forced to break away from. The game to beg someone for a hint using Twitter.. No THANK YOU... Delete if this isn't fixed."
"10317",1045232937,"I'm only on level 4 so far, but this review is not too early.  The levels are surprisingly challenging, even though the gameplay is so simple. I am very much digging the unique puzzle mechanics.   üì¶"
"10318",1045268097,"From day one to now. I love the information, ease of use, and in depth this app is."
"10319",1045268097,"Love this app. Very well designed and always fun to look at when in a new place. Cheers to the developer!"
"10320",1045268097,"When traveling, it‚Äôs an amazing way to find things that outside of tourist zones. Wandering through towns, looking up historic buildings, finding notes that would elude even the best guidebooks."
"10321",1045436888,"Every time I finish a game or even in solo mode it freezes and doesn‚Äôt count as anything. A bit frustrating. I wonder if they are ever going to do any new courses game is getting a bit boring it‚Äôs ALWAYS the same courses. One star for now."
"10322",1045436888,"No amount of money or skill will help you in this game, your skill level and ball determines which ‚Äúbot‚Äù you‚Äôll be matched against.  Fun game, but please don‚Äôt spend money on it, it WILL NOT help! Throwing you‚Äôre hard earned money in a wishing well will have better results than spending it on this rigged game."
"10323",1045436888,"I love the game, was a fan from the beginning almost 4 years ago now. But the player count is so low, there‚Äôs no one to play against and no way to advance now. Not the apps fault. Would recommend a second game to come out to interest more and new players."
"10324",1045504326,"I'm going to try and get my money back, having been tricked into buying this thing. This thing seems to have been designed by an AI with the barest understanding of what constitutes a game. Either that or it was a level one exercise in graphics programming at a coding institute in an East Asian country. It really is simply a few basic programming elements slapped haphazardly together ‚Ä¶ and that's it.  Basically you tap left and right to guide a first-person perspective ""runner"" down platforms in a 3D monochrome maze as an 8-bit theme, around five notes booping up and down a major scale, loops in the background and a voice narrates nonsense phrases: ""Your shoes are shiny. Now is not the time for your inner fight. I am not with you."" Like that. The eye-hurting monochrome colors change randomly. There are a few random objects floating in space between the platforms: woman heads, Ben Franklin heads, arms, buildings. They serve no purpose. The screen glitches randomly. Sometimes your runner runs into a cube that chimes and changes the monochrome background once more. If you fall off the platform you start over. As you progress down the maze the runner's speed increases, and the runner's base starting speed also increases a little each time you are ""killed"" and restart, unless you force quit the game and restart the app entirely to bring your runner back to the beginning base speed ‚Ä¶ so probably the game designers gain some advantage every time a player logs out of Game Center and logs back in again, maybe something involving ranking. Anyhow, there are no clues to the mazes, and most of the challenge of running through them involves poor control response or being visually unable to see what's happening, either by having the screen blocked by glitches or by being blinded by a particularly bright monochrome background, lime on canary, for example, or orange against tangerine. Finishing a level brings up a new one that's slightly different from the last, for no particular reason, as there is no storyline, no plot, no interaction other than tapping left and right and hoping the runner responds, and the random objects don't change, they just cycle.  Seriously, this is a coding exercise someone decided to sell as an overpriced app. Imagine you were demonstrating 3D technology for the first time, and you just looped visuals of a first-person perspective going over a set of ramps, turning left and right around an Atari 2600 representation of a city comprising nine office blocks, three woman heads, a Ben Franklin head and seven up-stretched arms. To demonstrate voice synthesis you program in some phrases from a phrase book: ""Your shoes are shiny. The city is alive tonight."" Because you're limited to 8-bit color for this 101 class exercise you choose monochromes of lime green against emerald green. And that's it.  But to drum up excitement you shell out one eighth of a Bitcoin to bored Russian youths on whatever the current version of Hansa Market is to buy 250 good reviews from them. And there you have the game's gameplay and business model. ‚Ä¶Enjoy?  Seriously, don't buy this thing. Just don't. Get a level-1 programming book and code in the first exercise of the first page of the first chapter into Eclipse yourself and you will get pretty much the same result, for cheaper, and you'll have learned a new skill to boot. But don't reward the lazy failing student who cribbed this from a beginner's guide to 8-bit color and 3D vector plane graphics."
"10325",1045504326,"I played this game time and time again and every single time it never lets me turn the way I want to and I can't even get past level one because of that I don't get it"
"10326",1045504326,"I usually do not write reviews, but I decided it was needed for this game. The graphics are amazing, it's very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The music grabs you and tugs you back into simple 8-bit music, and it fits well with the gameplay, even I, who would turn on music while playing games instead of listening to the soundtracks, kept the sound on for this game. Some people might complain the gameplay is repetitive, but compared to other ""free"" war or matching games, it's pretty tame, and takes it's own spin on things. Some people will whine because they aren't open to games that take a different direction. I highly suggest this game for any looking for a nice time waster, this is with no doubt worth the 2 dollars."
"10327",1045516045,"This game is awesome,but the ads never work.say I wanted free tickets idk but they really need to fix this bug SOON!Plus sometimes it gets borin"
"10328",1045516045,"I do not like how it‚Äôs graphics are not that good they look very old it looks like it‚Äôs glitching"
"10329",1045516045,"Is really just slim on stuff"
"10330",1045823211,"I love the silly characters it is a great game you should get it And there're is no bad words"
"10331",1045823211,"I used to love this game but now when I try to play it just exits the app. Please fix"
"10332",1045823211,"I can‚Äôt play this game why won‚Äôt it let me download please help me"

"10335",1045901853,"I love geometry Dash so I had to get this really like the music but this game realyyyyy needs more levels please"
"10336",1046345589,"I also use the pro football version. Audio quality much poorer than tune-in radio. Huge easy upgrade idea: link to the audio stream directly from the scoreboard. That would be so much easier than scrolling through all the teams..."
"10337",1046345589,"I‚Äôve used the related NFL app and was excited to find this college app.  The feeds are quality and lots of teams.  Definitely worth the money despite the vintage graphics look.  The best part is that the streams use little data allowing me to use it on the road without worrying about burning through my data."
"10338",1046345589,"This app works OK however I noticed that the pro baseball app I could not even leave a rating. Mostly because it isn‚Äôt working well be careful they will get you on that pro baseball sneaky sneaky sneaky!"
"10339",1046432580,"FIRST OFF I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I‚ÄôM WRITING THIS IN CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE IT IS EASIER TO READ FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND I KNOW THAT IT IS MUCH MORE PROPER GRAMMAR TO USE ONLY ONE EXCLAMATION MARK.   I AM A VERY GREAT MAN WHO HAS A GREAT PHONE. IT‚ÄôS USED BUT IT IS AT LEAST AN IPHONE 4. I LIVE IN ALABAMA WITH MY MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE GRANDCHILDREN, EIGHT OF THEM. ONE GRANDCHILD, BILLY, HACKED ONTO MY PHONE BECAUSE HE SAW ME PUT IN THE PASS CODE SO HE HACKED IN. MY OLD PASSCODE WAS 4555 FOR MY WINDOW‚ÄôS AND I‚ÄôS WEDDING DATE, 4/5/55, BUT THEN BECAUSE HE HACKED I CHANGED THE PLACES OF THE TWO FIVES. AFTER HE HACKED ON, HE GOT THIS GAME. LATER I CLICKED ON IT AND WAS WONDERING WHAT IT WAS, AND I CLICKED ON IT AND IT SAID THE F WORD. VERY INAPPROPRIATE. THEN I PUT BILLY IN TIME OUT FOR ONE WEEK IN THE TIME OUT CHAIR.  I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS STORY. I DON‚ÄôT.  IT WAS VERY INAPPROPRIATE"
"10340",1046432580,"love this app lol!! if you‚Äôre a teen and love memes, it‚Äôs just great. when i‚Äôm in class i‚Äôll play it and everyone knows it and just goes w it. love love love it !! don‚Äôt recommend if you don‚Äôt have a sense of humour tho."
"10341",1046432580,"I HATE IT! IT CURSES!"

"10343",1046480662,"What is judgement of ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù? Shows advertisement in mind of professional? Piece of junk at all."
"10344",1046480662,"When is it right for any paid app to inundate the user with ads??? Totally annoying and maddening."
"10345",1046505126,"I enjoy playing this game daily! You get a daily coin reward for each consecutive day you play- however it is stuck at 3 days. Fix this bug to reward racers as advertised!"
"10346",1046505126,"Even if it doesn't crag game is not fun"
"10347",1046505126,"A great way to waste 5 mins several times a day, then you start dreaming about it."
"10348",1046510029,"I am so excited because I just got my Bose music box!! The sound when I got it hooked up was crazy great!!! I just love Bose and the app made it so easy to hook up and start listening to my music!! Love it!!!"
"10349",1046510029,"This app just can't seem to figure out connecting to two Bluetooth sources.  When connted to my iPhone and windows 10 laptop the earphones have white noise that turns on and off even though there is nothing playing in my computer browser."
"10350",1046510029,"Simply amazing  The sound is remarkable  The functionality is we conceived"
"10351",1046553860,"A perfect 5/7 really."
"10352",1046553860,"This is the most entertaining app on the Apple Watch! For example, if you were bored you could play on that app and you wouldn‚Äôt need your phone to do so!! This app is amazing and I would like to see moreü•∫"
"10353",1046553860,"This is by far the best game I have ever had on my ap! Highly recommend!"
"10354",1046593064,"why is there an ad everytime i open the game now?? there has never been an ad and now there is and it is annoying! please take it off. thank you"
"10355",1046593064,"Whenever i reach a new highscore in any character, it doesn‚Äôt save. The game would be more fun if i was able to beat highscores but they don‚Äôt save."
"10356",1046593064,"I love this game and completing weekend challenges and daily challenges. I‚Äôve also been playing it for quite a few years now. The reason I‚Äôm giving it four stars is that it needs new characters and add more movies. You can  add more Disney movies like Little Mermaid or add Disney channel movies like High School Musical, Teen Beach Movie, and maybe even Descendants. Adding new movies would make this game better. I hope you guys can consider the possibilities and add new characters and movies. Thanks!!"
"10357",1046617847,"You only need a few minutes to learn the concepts of this game. But once you pick it up you will find it forces you to think in many different ways. Thank you for a game that can be played in as little as a minute or keep you going for hours."
"10358",1046617847,"A truly fun to play indie game, it's very refreshing not dealing with the horrible free to play system. Great job, levels are well thought out and art is amazing."
"10359",1046617847,"Spent the money on light bulbs for help but can't get them to give the medals. But the light bulbs are being used!!!! Where's the medals and stars when I earn them?"

"10363",1046694770,"Love it"
"10364",1046694770,"And to me, that's a sign of a good app. I appreciate the fact they are being exposed to a variety of instruments, melodies, arrangements, etc., in a fun, handheld setting. If there ever was a ""gateway"" app to encourage your children to make music, this is it: My 5 yo has asked for his own sitar to add to his growing collection of instruments and we're all for it!"
"10365",1046694770,"Elmo + music makes for a great combination. My little ones love playing along with their Sesame Street friends. Great app!"

"10372",1046846443,"I love the game it is one of my all time favorites. How ever I do wish it was a bit more realistic. Like it would be cool is there were sea plants and things like coral reefs. We also wish that there was more sharks. I have gotten all of the sharks and I see trailers of the same sharks with new skin. It‚Äôs nice but new sharks would be better.  Also do you know how in hungry shark there is a giant crab that you can fight I miss that in the new game. I also wish there were more seas to visit. It has the main ones but after you memorize them it gets boring. Thank you so much for the game and I hope you will take my thoughts into consideration. Byeüêü"

"10376",1047205902,"Good game"
"10377",1047205902,"MAGA"
"10378",1047246341,"Just ever harder and higher levels forcing purchases to play and putting bonuses on wrong places for effective use and no choice. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money. I‚Äôd give a negative 1 if I could. The levels I am at are at least somewhat doable‚Äî800."
"10379",1047246341,"I think the game is fun, it has its challenges, but who am I playing?  Where is the challenge of my friends? Why can‚Äôt ya play against someone else? Set up challenges like Candy Crush original? Gotta be something to the game... besides clearing jelly and getting pufflers"
"10380",1047246341,"üòçüòçüòçüòçü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it."
"10381",1047264616,"Papas cupcakeeria is awesome and addicting sometimes my game will glitch out and freeze but my cupcakes will still bern but it's still awesome that's why I give it 4 stars."
"10382",1047264616,"I got many of these games on my iPad when I was a girl and I loved them. However, once I got a phone I went to download them off of my purchases and they didn't show up. I then checked the App Store and found that it didn't show up there either."
"10383",1047264616,"This game is awesome but I wish their was updates also I am about to unlock everything on papas and can‚Äôt wait for the next one.üòÅ"
"10384",1047340501,"Aside from facetune, it‚Äôs my go to app. i love the minimal things that i do with it, and still have yet to really explore it. So there are a lot of features to explore."
"10385",1047340501,"Ahhhhsome"
"10386",1047340501,"I use my phone with a clicker so I can get in the picture. The app doesn‚Äôt allow for that. Sent a message to the app developer and have not gotten a response in over a week. Might be a good app, but completely useless to me."
"10387",1047566421,"Amazing game but please fix the squad glitch."
"10388",1047566421,"Very nice and entertaining game. Keeps you driven to achieve that dream team."
"10389",1047566421,"Wish there was a way to edit player names to make it more accurate. But overall fun so far!"
"10390",1047595823,"Yok much ads, annoyingüò§"

"10392",1047595823,"The beautiful designs of each level are really fantastic."
"10393",1047653834,"All in all it is a fun game that gets seriously hurt by the number of ads you put. It is extremely frustrating and, by the way, it lags the game too. If I go into another attempt without waiting 10 seconds first, I will lag like crazy and hit a wall, giving me another ad, repeating the whole process. I'm angry no one thought of this when they were testing the game."
"10394",1047653834,"Overall this is a good game. The reason for the three stars is the ads. Once you try to start a new game an ad pops up right as you tap sending you to the App Store or to the Internet. That is my only real problem with it but everyone else complains that the controls are awful. You have to keep playing to get used to them. Also, I would like to see more levels."
"10395",1047653834,"Waste of time!!! It was okay the first time before I died. But after that, it became a ""bored"" game."
"10396",1047666264,"This game has so much to do and even after beating it I still wasn‚Äôt tired of playing"
"10397",1047666264,"I love this game just I don‚Äôt know how to get to the new level"
"10398",1047666264,"I thought it was good until I died, it keeps crashing every time I die. I'm hoping you can fix this."
"10399",1047713034,"This game stinks every thing is boring"
"10400",1047713034,"Loves it !"
"10401",1047713034,"Love it"
"10402",1047713752,"My daughter seems to love it and we don't seem to have any issues"
"10403",1047713752,"I love the all the fun games"
"10404",1047713752,"Fun and cool to play"
"10405",1047733214,"Fun"
"10406",1047733214,"The app is fun until you have basically finished the game and the devs said they would add another update butt I‚Äôve played and waited for a year and they still haven‚Äôt updated the game yet"
"10407",1047733214,"Game is great , nearing the end of the story line and am getting some things in my way  There is no way to set a consistent angle to fly at and the phone tilt is sometimes difficult to control and the button is just the same but worse.   It may be better to use arrows on either side to adjust angle  Once you are past 1000m high the camera does not follow your character . Which completely negates late game content as you cannot steer your craft and it spins out of control until you get below the height limit.  Besides those two things, game is not too bad at all. Probably 6-8 hours in total played so far"
"10408",1047755798,"Great game"
"10409",1047755798,"Finally an interesting and creepy plot! Please make more like this! I actually jumped a few times"
"10410",1047755798,"I can't understand the negative reviews I just read because this game has totally kept my attention (which is not always easy w/me), has stunning graphics, very nicely done HOS (such as a HOS within a HOS; clever! And riddles where the answer is the item you need to find) and perfectly fine story!   I am halfway through right now and enjoy coming back to play more.   Big Fish: Make more with graphics and HOS like this and you'll continue to have a forever fan in me. And almost no occultic BS in this one, a greatly added plus!"
"10411",1047755932,"It's fantastic! This is the one I've been waiting for.  One great thing: doesnt have one of those awful ""cinematic"" orchestral soundtracks. This one has spooky creepy sound effects. Update: Got tedious after awhile. Not as great as it seemed."
"10412",1047755932,"Just released this game AGAIN!May 4.2016.Even if you check the ""already Purchased""It will say you haven't purchased even though you had.A rip off BF again!!üëé"
"10413",1047755932,"Check your purchases before buying. But if you haven't played it from what I can remember it was a lot of running back and forth."
"10414",1047763490,"Have been looking for a sentence-construction app like this for so long‚Äîfinally it‚Äôs here.  So helpful in learning to form Spanish sentences.  Thank you, Avaz!"

"10429",1048130311,"I love this game but am consistently not being awarded the gems that I‚Äôve won.  I‚Äôd give 5 stars but I‚Äôm so annoyed.  Fix the issues please!"
"10430",1048130311,"Used to be a great card game...now it‚Äôs rigged. You will either win a ton all in a row or lose double that all in row. It‚Äôs awful. This used to be my favorite game and today I am deleting it."
"10431",1048130311,"I used to love this game when I could play and win just enough hands to keep playing, but that‚Äôs no longer the case. It‚Äôs so frustrating to lose hand after hand without having any chance to win given the cards being dealt."
"10432",1048139188,"Of all the hockey games by this developer, this is the one to get. More teams. No energy bars that run out. Big Head hockey no rules first to 5 is a kick. $4 very fair price for entertainment value."
"10433",1048139188,"When I first played I was surprised about how good this game is you can pick any NHL team any international team and it has first to 5 goals in that game mode there are no rules"
"10434",1048139188,"It is not overly difficult to play, and it can be competitive. Some games make impossible to win unless you spend a lot of time learning techniques. You could adjust teams, add season mode, home or away team option, and player versus player mode could be included. Graphics are excellent."
"10435",1048228014,"Is it possible to get my money back?  The game won‚Äôt let us in."
"10436",1048228014,"My 3 year old was able to finish this like nothing and he still plays it. I just thought for the price there would be a lot more levels that what there were."
"10437",1048228014,"It's true that there should be more variety in the levels. That said, my 3 year old is delighted with the game, and that's why I bought it."
"10438",1048260999,"My 4-year-old really loved this game, but he had it beat in maybe 40-45 minutes. I was really surprised it was so short, especially having payed for it, but at least he loved it."
"10439",1048260999,"This game is great, my 4 year old loves it. My only complaint is that it's too short. We just downloaded it last night and he has already beat it.  If you pay $4 for s game you'd expect it to last a bit longer...."

"10441",1048277914,"I really like this type of game, and this one is very enjoyable!  I love the artwork, puzzles and unfolding of the story. I do rely heavily on the hints, (I'm a really old player) but they are clever and well done, and I expect next time I play it, I won't rely on them so much. ..and trust me, I will play it again!  üòâ The story unfolds well, with sinister surprises, the puzzles are fun, and I LOVE my little companion - He's got personality! (won't say more, as I don't want to spoil the adventure for other players)."
"10442",1048277914,"Entertaining for a few hours. What more can you ask of a game?  No crashes or glitches.  Various puzzle levels for beginner or expert."
"10443",1048277914,"It's not worth what I spent for it, I do really regret it..."
"10444",1048505998,"Love it"
"10445",1048505998,"The game is okay and time can pass by. The game doesn‚Äôt have many optional things except killing monsters. One very good note is that the details on the monsters and troops or different units are amazing. I‚Äôm hoping for and update where people can attack the monsters. Also new units and more details that I wish you could add."

"10450",1048542880,"Made the mistake of starting this game casually 3 years ago, then joining an Alliance and making friends. The camaraderie is the ONLY redeeming quality of this game. Every thing else is about spending money. There is no parity, only pay to play dominance. This game setup fosters cyber bullying and the latest update introduced some random anime porn characters for no reason at all (except to entice players to spend more money). You‚Äôll see the other reviews mention ‚ÄúLee.‚Äù Lee.y is the name we all receive replies from when we complain about the horrid game. He prolly has a fleet of Lambo‚Äôs by now as some players have spent tens of thousands of dollars on this vile app. Do yourself a favor and get Candy Crush instead. This game and this developer are the WORST."
"10451",1048542880,"I met some really cool people on this game through my alliance, however, this game is a money hole, a pit of despair and a waste of time. Don‚Äôt fall down this rabbit hole. Lee will get you.   Henerik  s29 (I think it‚Äôs been a while) Freak AAC"

"10456",1048629983,"The game excelled in soundtrack, plot, game mechanics and adorable cgi."
"10457",1048629983,"This is just a port of a PSP graphic update to a beloved game boy game that has aged very very poorly. While the polygonal 3-D graphics are snazzy, and the music as awesome as ever, the gameplay and storyline of this game were really never very engaging.....or fun to begin with.  Control wise, if you have an MFI controller, then it plays perfectly but who cares when you‚Äôll be endlessly grinding against flat uninteresting monsters in order to accomplish forgettable fetch quests thrown at you by cardboard characters in a mellow dramatic, convoluted ‚Äústory‚Äù so contrived and so ham fisted that it makes daytime soap operas feel like Shakespeare by comparison?  The game is riddled with game ending, unsolvable ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù that involve doing asinine, ridiculously cryptic tasks like: walking around two trees in a the shape of a figure 8 until a secret door opens.....at some random, undisclosed place in the monotonous, one dimensional woods, that look like all the other woods. Without a walkthrough the game is virtually unbeatable.  With the look and sound being as good as it is, if this game were a completely reimagined (True Remake) of Final Fantasy Adventure then I think they could justify the relatively steep price.... but as it is? This game is just not worth the money or the time. The original was considered good in its time, for a game boy game (that people couldn‚Äôt beat even back then) but by todays standards your better off playing so many other games."
"10458",1048629983,"I loved this game back in the day. I found it on the App Store awhile back and have replayed it every few months or so. It is still continuously supported which is awesome. I really wish they would do a completely original sequel to this with these graphical updates."

"10468",1048881232,"This game is a tricky clone of another app by a reputable developer. This one regularly displays ads for other games, ads that are almost impossible to escape without flipping you over to the app store. Toddlers shouldn't be targeted for ads in the first place--much less frustrating ads that take over the screen and end up switching them out of the game they wanted to play. This is dirty, dirty behavior. I hope Apple cracks down on garbage like this SOON."
"10469",1048881232,"You need to add a way to remove ads.  Most ads are not age appropriate.  It‚Äôs a shame that you‚Äôve ruined what would be a great app with constant full screen add interruptions."
"10470",1048881232,"I downloaded this for my toddler granddaughter.  We used to have it for the older grands and they loved it.  This time the ads were horrible.  Every thing she touched brought up an ad!  Totally frustrating to her and me.  I deleted it."
"10471",1048896882,"I love the game is super fun but the only problem I have is that when you make a level and you finish it to post it you have to constantly redo it until you get the thumbnail that you want. Otherwise great game"

I have over 3 million in coins and nothing to spend it on except nitro. Big bang racing you forgot about some of us people that made you who you are. I wish I was born with the creativity that some have in this game for building tracks. All I have is a thumb for racing!!  Marty G"
"10473",1048896882,"I left for the Summer, and when I came back I was welcomed kindly. Not only can you make friends in this game, the racing is so smooth!

The normal texting keyboard just won‚Äôt cut it, that‚Äôs where Textastic comes in. With almost everything being customizable, code completion and intuitive shortcuts for all the normal dev symbols ex. (){}[]=$‚Äù; etc. this app is well worth the $9.99. Also, this app is very well maintained and is consistently being updated with fixes and requests from users on how to make the app better. Anyone writing code on the go should definitely pick this up. Great job!"

"10502",1050339928,"I bought this on a whim as I was looking for an app to create my own music visualizations.  Not exactly what I wanted, but I absolutely love it nonetheless and find the various tools to be quite adequate for creating a stellar array of beautiful imagery.   Highly addicting, and I cannot give the developer enough props for the SILKY smooth user interface and just the overall aesthetic.  Very tasteful.  A true masterpiece.    My only wish is that there would be two additional draw tools: 1. One that draws perfect circles that can be resized and spiraled with dragging motions, for easier ‚Äúflower of life‚Äù type shapes  2.  A straight line tool, where you place point A, drag to point B, and when releasing the touch a perfectly straight line is drawn.  Currently, you have to swipe pretty fast to get anything close to a straight line and the swipe speed leads to lots of inaccuracies.  Also I would love to see this somehow someway morphed into a custom music visual creator. It would be divine.  That is what I was looking for to begin with, but I‚Äôm very happy to have found this."
"10503",1050339928,"It would be nice to have many undos. also it would be nice to have an option to hide the X and those on the bottom screen. i made some beautiful art only to be two stepped to blackness. if you could add a feature to hide the three like The X, share and the one that would be great."

"10510",1050452180,"This app is so helpful and is really keeping me on task. I feel like I‚Äôm accomplishing my goals so much more easily. I have more mental space without decision fatigue or overwhelm throughout the day since everything I need and want to do has its own spot in my day now.  I do wish I not have to assign a day for special routines that aren‚Äôt regular-like a shortened routine for a special event, emergency or just needing extra sleep. Pretty much every day in my week has a slight difference and I‚Äôd love to be able to see my week at a glance with my different routines on each day.  I also wish there was some more excitement when the timer goes to the next task. It‚Äôd be nice if I could click ‚Äúdone‚Äù or ‚Äúskip‚Äù instead of the timer just moving on to the next task. It would be awesome if it played music and went to the next song for each task. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the voice command gave some kind of encouragement along the way too..like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre very focused today! Keep going!‚Äù Etc.   Even without those, it‚Äôs a great app and has made a very big positive difference for me and my family! Thank you!!"
"10511",1050452180,"I generally like the user experience. But one thing that bothers me is that if you move on to the next task before the time runs out on the current task, then the current tasks won‚Äôt be marked as ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù.  So if you give yourself 15 minutes to eat breakfast, but finish eating in just 10 minutes, then you have to sit around and do nothing for 5 minutes if you want the ‚Äúeat breakfast‚Äù task to be marked as complete.  If you skip ahead to the next task before the time is up, it doesn‚Äôt get marked as competed. So weird!  You also don‚Äôt have an option of completing tasks out of order.  So if your next task is ‚Äútake a shower‚Äù but your partner is using the bathroom, you can‚Äôt just move on to another task and come back to the current one later.  The Routinist app has really figured out all these little details. But their UI isn‚Äôt very good. I think the Morning Routine app developers should try to duplicate all of Routinist‚Äôs features, but keep the good UI that Morning Routine has. That would make a truly killer app."
"10512",1050452180,"I really love this app, it has been very helpful to me in the morning and keeps me on time and helps me stay on schedule. After my positive experience with the morning routine I wanted to create an evening routine also but then to my surprise I couldn‚Äôt. I had to pay $12(!!) for anymore routines. I have now started using a second app for my evening routine due to the issue with paying for more routines. I would have payed 4 or 5 dollars but not above that. I love my morning routine though and I recommend this app if you‚Äôre just looking for 1 routine!"
"10513",1050535507,"I love everything about this game, like the story and characters, like the gameplay and difficulty, I‚Äôve unlocked master on every single song except for the last one in stage 4. But I need you to change the daily song system. I don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs random, that‚Äôs what I expected and there are no issues. Definitely don‚Äôt mind that you need to see an ad to play it. That makes sense. But please let me choose my difficulty. I understand if I cannot get master difficulty but if I get whisper difficulty every time then I‚Äôm not going to use it. If I want to just listen to the song I‚Äôd look it up on YouTube!"
"10514",1050535507,"I love this game, but most of the songs have become boring after playing them all the time. I don‚Äôt have the money to constantly buy the new packs, and I thought this new Daily Song system sounded awesome! I get to play new songs all the time now! I usually only play a little each day, so it‚Äôll be great for me, right?  Oh, so wrong.  You see, you get five chances every day. Firstly, the song you get is random. You don‚Äôt have any control over what song you play. That wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, even though you have to watch an ad beforehand, if it weren‚Äôt for the second problem. You don‚Äôt even get to choose the difficulty. WHY?! What is there to gain by preventing your players from choosing the diff? It says a ‚Äúrandom difficulty‚Äù, but I got Whisper, the easiest one, all five times. As an experienced player, it was so boring I quit every time trying to get ONE harder song, and never did. Also, if it is truly random, imagine the opposite problem. A new player keeps getting hard songs, gets intimidated and never buys any of them. Or worse, they never play again.  I‚Äôd like to say I appreciate the IDEA. I think a daily song is great, and hey, if I like a map enough I might just consider buying it. But as it stands, being unable to see what I‚Äôm buying makes me very apprehensive, and this new Daily Song system does not alleviate my worries in the slightest."
"10515",1050535507,"This is SO FUN to play with my friends! Its got beautiful art and the story is engaging (when it updates)."
"10516",1050608523,"If you go to settings on Facebook then apps you can see which apps are logged in and collecting data - this was one of them!

"10522",1050763662,"Nice game until it quit and wouldn't open a hidden object puzzle. No way to continue after trying several times. A complete waste of money."
"10523",1050763662,"Instead of having the map 'out' with it own icon, you have to go thru the menu and select it. Pain in the rear.  Plus, it is booorrrriiiinnnnngggg!  Poor job."

"10525",1050973882,"I think this is the best army type strategy game I've found. I lovw the Arma games from PC but this is nice to have on the go. Just wish some things didn't take so long to build and could do more in a faster pace."
"10526",1050973882,"This game is pretty fun, but it has a few drawbacks that keep it from being perfect. First off the progression in this game is S L O W, when I upgraded my hq to level 5 it cost 250,000 supplies, that was fair enough, but then for upgrading to level 6 it suddenly jumps up to 750,000, not cool Bohemia, the ArmA pedigree deserves better. The other thing holding this game back is that the campaign stories take a massive spike up in difficulty in some of the levels, and like I said, the progression is slow so you often times hit a wall where you don‚Äôt have the troops or the resources to win a battle.   UPDATE: A new issue with this game has come to my attention, the matchmaking system blows. Not only have three of the last five players to attack my base been drastically underleveled and stood no chance of beating me, the other two players to attack me were near double my level! When I went into the matchmaking myself hoping for a player at least near my level, the game sent me (a level 27 player) to attack a level 206 player! Seriously Bohemia fix this game‚Äôs issues, your company knows better than to release an underdeveloped game like this under the ArmA pedigree."
"10527",1050973882,"I find it frustrating just because I haven‚Äôt been active much does it mean there‚Äôs gonna be a error in the way and I lose all my progress. I‚Äôm going to rage quit and I‚Äôm giving this game a bad review"
"10528",1050988480,"This app doesn‚Äôt support newer iPad resolutions so there are large black bars on all 4 sides of the screen if you own the later model iPads."

"10530",1050988480,"I don‚Äôt find this helpful at all. How can you have a potty app and not have a timer or a log or anything of that nature. It‚Äôs just some rinky-dink games and song. This should be free."

"10538",1051334048,"I haven‚Äôt even started and I‚Äôve already uninstalled. The fact that I get 6 battles a day unless I purchase premium is a stupid, blatant cash grab. What exactly is the reason I am unable to play as many as I want?  With practices like this it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it gets worse and I‚Äôm pulling out before it‚Äôs does"
"10539",1051334048,"Too many people have hacked the game so its not fun, don‚Äôt waste your time, pick another version. Hasbro blatantly fosters discrimination as well so double eww."
"10540",1051434604,"It is addictive at first but then you can stop playing it. You can unlock so many things. it is so much fun! You can play multiplayer but you have to both have to get the same version and it has to be Snowboard party world tour pro. It does cost 10.00$ It is a little over priced but otherwise it is a great game!"
"10541",1051434604,"You have to stick with it. At first, I felt that the control stick was awkward, and it felt a little weird that you have to press a button to grind (similar to the THPS/THUG games, instead of just grinding automatically like the SSX games) All that said, you just have to stick with it. I‚Äôm now used to the controls, and there‚Äôs a ton of content here (considering a price tag of $10) There‚Äôs a freestyle, half-pipe, and big air event, with several maps for each, and plenty of characters to equip with stat upgrades, and alternate boards and outfits. The graphics are pretty good, and even go as far as leaving a trail in the snow behind you (a few other snowboarding apps I‚Äôve played actually miss this small detail, which doesn‚Äôt hurt gameplay, but the added immersion it brings in this instance is nice) This game is about as close to SSX as I can imagine playing on my phone. Really good work from the developer, would recommend."
"10542",1051434604,"I really enjoyed playing this game and I was excited to play it again after downloading it on my new phone tonight.  My excitement quickly turned to frustration after I noticed that the game didn‚Äôt transfer over anything from my old phone.  It‚Äôs seriously upsetting... I spent a lot of time and money on this game to unlock courses, boards, riders, their outfits, and max out skills.  The App Store didn‚Äôt make me purchase this game again just because I‚Äôm on a new phone!"
"10543",1051638513,"It is a horrible game but sometimes fun"

"10546",1051656345,"I spent the whole softball season not knowing where the heck our games would be because the app does not sync with the web. It rains a lot in Chicago so games co Stanley get cancelled.  I would contact support but there is NO support link in the app. And when you select support on the app review page, it goes to a dead page. Get your act together before telling us this is a great tool.  If you had customer support available I would have contacted them rather than slamming you here."
"10547",1051656345,"How do you update to this school year. It still shows last year. New game dates are on the school website. ????"
"10548",1051656345,"Positive: The really nice thing about the 8 to 18 app is the opportunity to select categories of interest for your family, covering multiple activities, grades, and seasons.  It‚Äôs convenient and helpful to have all the information collected in one place.   Needs improvement: 1. The display on My Calendar is arranged in a Monday through Sunday format, which is disorienting as most American calendars display Sunday through Saturday. Please add a convenient way to choose alternate formats.   2. On the landing page ‚Äútoday‚Äôs events‚Äù and ‚Äúupcoming events‚Äù you have to swipe down to update, or it will show old dates. Why not update when the app opens instead of having to manually update?   3. There is a way to export 8 to 18 files for import into Google or Microsoft calendars, but it would be nice if it was easier or more obvious how to do that."
"10549",1051708566,"Super s√©lection de restos et appli plut√¥t bien faite. Mais un bug majeur, l‚Äôappli vide la batterie en quelques minutes. Pour vous donner un ordre de grandeur, je pense que je perds 20% en 5 minutes d‚Äôutilisation de l‚Äôapplication, ce qui la rend extr√™mement penible a utiliser.

"10556",1052035509,"This game is good and defiantly can be better. These are something that should be added  1. More weapons 2. More Dinos 3.More craft able items 4. Make the map show were you are 5.Add a cursor it is so hard to aim the spear 6.Make the bone not have unlimited arrows  I know this is a lot and hard to add but it will really help the game"

Could be a üòÑ but now just a üòê make it co-op so i would be able to play online or with Game Center friends or just through wifi play co-op. Other then that good game I would recommend it to almost anyone just give it some time. Thank you bye"
"10558",1052109508,"I have a very reluctant math student in my house and he didn‚Äôt even realize that he was doing math with this game. Amazing. That said, it crashes at level 13 every time :/ hope this gets fixed soon!!!"

"10564",1052556488,"This game would be so much better if it didn‚Äôt always close and reload when you leave the app or switch to a different app. As it is it annoys me so much I stopped playing"
"10565",1052556488,"First time doing a review. Love this game! Extremely high replay value! Strategist dream!  Some puzzles are hard so those 1/5 stars are people that give up easy.  Easy mode for casuals players. Great community on FB.  Crazy party settings after beating the game once!"
"10566",1052556488,"Not a review writer, but this game deserves some merit.  Detailed enough to make the characters feel unique.  Very expansive.  Reminds me of exploring the original Zelda map as a kid, but with a stacked party of hero, and way bigger world. Lots of cool gear to find.  The creator is very active with updates and making the game better.  I have had the game for a few years, and have not yet finished it, as I am busy, but have leveled several parties up to level 20 multiple times.  Currently running a party of with two barbarians, a knight, a Druid, a wizard and of corse, a Cleric.  I love trying to roll the perfect stats for each character.  Great game, and much appreciation to the developer!  Thanks!"

"10570",1052661250,"The app says Japanese and English as the two languages but it‚Äôs only Japanese. I would love to play this game it looks fun and all but I can‚Äôt really play if I don‚Äôt know what a single word means. Please make these game in English thank you very much"

"10574",1052682268,"I like how there are different areas. The art is cute but it isn't special. I tried to do the part where you pick your train color and drive around picking up people to be on your train--except the ""challenge(s)"" were just blocks that you move into place to fix the broken road every single time! It was so annoying; there should be an option where you just just drive around and enjoy the scenery. I also wanted to like how you can pretend to operate the train when I realized the background was my finger; making reality the backdrop of the train operation made it far less interesting in my opinion. It's cool how you can draw in one of the things, but this isn't a drawing app. Overall a mixed bag of cuteness, little bit of fun, trains, and lots of confusion and frustration."

I would rate it a one but I rated it a two cause my little cousins still like it.

Not to mention people still hack this game and drop 40-50 elixir at a time. Save your time and energy don‚Äôt play this trash game"
"10595",1053012308,"Great game. Entertaining. It‚Äôs a bummer card and tower levels play such an important role in climbing trophy ladder. The variety in good decks is also not great. You‚Äôll play against the same 5 decks over and over, and they‚Äôre popular for a reason - they‚Äôre winnable. If you try to introduce variety, you‚Äôll likely lose, which feels bad."

"10604",1053388964,"Cool"
"10605",1053388964,"Just deleted this game. The last two updates weren't  necessary. The game was fine before it. It freezes and crashes. It's not worth watching the ads. I'm not spending any money on this game! Thanks for making space on my phone. Deleted."
"10606",1053524307,"Love watching the sharks and fish swim around me! This app makes me feel so calm and peaceful. Although if I was really surrounded by sharks and fish I‚Äôd freak out! üòÜ"

"10609",1053562258,"Fun game but it freezes at the police station after finding the feather piece. Won‚Äôt allow you to continue just goes back to home screen. Restarted it, uninstalled it, updated to latest iOS available and still the same. Want to finish game but can‚Äôt. Help."
"10610",1053562258,"Great Game!!"
"10611",1053562258,"This game played great on my iPad mini 2 which is so slow, but the game did not play slow at all.  I love spooky games and this delivered.  You can customize the time length for how long you want the hint feature to reset and I LOVE THIS! Great bonus game too.  Great game!"
"10612",1053605807,"I like the new graphics and the other stuff. I also like the default solar system that comes. However, Pluto appears to be shaking and having a broken (and jumping) trail, and the entire planet is pixelated and appears to be corrupt. Perhaps running out of floating-point precision like Minecraft? I don't what to tell you, man."
"10613",1053605807,"I got this app because I just really love the idea of space and being able to create this kind of universe. The recent changes with this app were all stellar and I love them, although it would be nice to choose between the new and old layouts. My biggest concern is the fact that I can‚Äôt play around with any ideas if I already have one I like. I decided I wanted to make a universe for a space traveler story I want to write, but unless I want to lose that whole world, I can‚Äôt just mess around and cause the collapse of a universe. So it‚Äôd be real cool if that was possible. More information on the planets and the life forms, and a way to add life forms to habitable planets would be very neat! This app has an excellent base, but I‚Äôd love to see more done with it."
"10614",1053605807,"Texture issues with the black hole. I wish I could slow down time a little bit because it‚Äôs hard to interact with your planets when they are going to fast for you to even tap. It‚Äôs pretty cool."
"10615",1053688442,"I think many people can agree that this game is CRAZY addictive. I would give it five stars, but every few levels, the game crashes. Right at the boss and it really annoys me. If you guys could fix it, then that would be amazing"
"10616",1053688442,"Ya should add a save feature so what if somebody deleted the app lost all their progress and have to start all over."

"10627",1053946396,"Tried it a few times during games and could not get the Celtics on the radio. Worthless.  Developer said not to give the app a bad rating without trying to contact him through customer service. I tried that too ‚Äî a few weeks ago ‚Äî and never got a response.   Basically all this app would do is listen to talk radio instead of games. I don‚Äôt want that, and even if I did, I wouldn‚Äôt need an app to listen to talk radio."

"10650",1054948424,"awesome app! but recently it has turned buggy on both my ipad air 2 and iphone 7 plus   the search is very buggy  plz put it to consideration"
"10651",1055138354,"Pressing left on the controller brings up the pause menu. Controls pretty much don‚Äôt work at all during menus. Touch controls do not disappear when using the controller. I don‚Äôt mess with touch controls when playing platformers and other games of the like (I don‚Äôt know why anyone would), so this game is unplayable. Basically I‚Äôve just given five dollars for nothing."
"10652",1055138354,"Not as good as the previous version."
"10653",1055138354,"The review by GoodGuyAvetis is right. It seems that the dividing line separating the left and right buttons isn't centered on my iphone 6. Therefore tapping right makes my ninja go left sometimes. Actually it does that a lot (going left instead of right). eg, instead of ‚¨ÖÔ∏è  |  ‚û°Ô∏è it feels like  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è    |‚û°Ô∏è As you can see there's not much tapping area for right button. If you tap a little to the left of right button, you'll go left.   I have to stretch out my thumb and position it more towards the center of the screen in order to be certain my ninja guy will go right when I tap right otherwise it's a crapshoot (he'll inexplicably go left and get killed). It's awkward and so uncomfortable, my thumb reverts back to a more natural position if I forget about it during gameplay. As a result, I keep dying over the lamest sht like going in the wrong direction.   I can't say if this is a problem on other devices with differing screen sizes because idk. I just know it's a problem when I play on my iphone 6. That's why I don't enjoy playing this game because it's so frustrating. It ruins the whole thing. Do I regret buying this game? Hell yeah I do. Therefore I cant recommend it if you have a device with a similar sized screen. (Assuming that's the problem).   Why can't you developers just shift the perimeters for both left and right buttons just a little more to the left? Then the dividing line would shift a little left and become more centered resulting in more tapping area for the right button.   To be honest, I don't have much confidence they'll even look into it seeing how they infrequently update their games and their tendency to just stop updating altogether after barely a year since release. I hope I'm wrong though."

"10660",1055281310,"My church purchased over 120 Hue Bulbs, 3 Bridges, and 6 dimmer switches (for 6 zones).    WE NEED YOUR APP TO CONTROL MORE THAN 1 BRIDGE AT A TIME.   We want to push 1 dimmer switch button and have ALL LIGHTS on 3 bridges turn off/on.  Currently we have to push 6 dimmer switch buttons and the result is SOMETIMES THEY WORK AND SOMETIMES THEY DON‚ÄôT, even though we get a green light on the dimmer switch.   We have done the UPDATES.  We have tried other apps with very poor results. MOST apps do not apply to more than one bridge.  Those that do apply to more than 1 bridge are Quirky.  HELP US PLEASE...This should work.   Jim Gerry A/V Lead Tech South Portland Church of the Nazarene.  South Portland, Maine"
"10661",1055281310,"I‚Äôm happy with the Hue app except one major thing I know everybody complains about...GROUPING ROOMS!!!! Why is this not included? I want to control the whole house at one time using room groups. Now, I do see the beta version of an upper level ‚Äúzoning‚Äù which works somewhat but at least add a copy and paste feature from already created individual room scenes, I don‚Äôt want to create whole new scenes on upper level room groups. Also, light grouping...Tying multiple lights together. and.... being able to copy and paste color light hues from room to room."
"10662",1055281310,"The widgets feature works great. Therefore, I have 8 Widgets setup so I can recall the scenes just by a few touches on my Apple Watch or my iOS devices. The only and the major problem here is, those widgets disappear every few weeks or so. And every time it happens, I have to redo the whole thing all over again. Which is extremely annoying. Please fix it."

"10673",1055455919,"This is personally one of the best games I‚Äôve ever owned and I have owned a lot of games, here is why... it is a very enjoyable game and fun to get high scores with lots of hidden characters and has a great dungeon crawler feel mixed with 2015 style crossyroad controls. I love the mix of characters from knights and wizards to goblins and ninjas. It has good sounds and graphics that also make up a fun dungeon crawler game. I don‚Äôt know if a whole lot of people still play this game but taco Illuminati should make some new updates so people will. My high score is 77 doors... good luck beating it!"

"10677",1055486126,"I experienced the same problem that several others had. My inventory disappeared and I couldn't go on. There doesn't appear to be an update that addresses this problem, so I won't be able to play the game. Very disappointed."
"10678",1055502792,"I would ask if in the one or to events, make a Hall of Fame event that can have the best players at their prime. Ex: Kyrie Irving Cav, Kobe Bryant Lak, Michael Jordan Chi, Lebron James Mia, Allen Iverson Six, etc. This could have these players at 90 to start, and the ending overall could be 107 and up. There should also be packs for the events. I am sure this event would make people‚Äôs days if they see this. Please add this event."

"10690",1055636344,"‚ÄúMainstage‚Äù for iPad. I can control all my instruments and plugins for live performance in one spot.  Also product support is fantastic!"
"10691",1055636344,"Really, really pleased w/ AUM. What a useful tool. The beautiful UI is icing on the cake."
"10692",1055636344,"Many people wonder whether they should get AudioBus or AUM.   I‚Äôve used Audiobus since it‚Äôs first version so to me that answer was clear once I came back to iOS music production: AudioBus 3.   That being said there‚Äôs so much talk about AUM going around so I HAD to get it eventually. I must say I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose‚Äù between one anymore.   Both are great and I would certainly recommend any: AUM however is far more intuitive and had a sleeker UI.   One thing I love about AUM is it‚Äôs AUv3 handling; the resizing of windows is amazing and really lets you take advantage of the small iPhone‚Äôs screen. You can have several apps at once displayed on a small tiny screen which I find amazing.   That being said, this is the only reason I wrote a review:  There‚Äôs another kid in town who does this even SLIGHTLY better than AUM, and that is ApeMatrix. I have the three and tbh I choose a different one depending on what I need. Often times I even combine them into my workflow.   However, ApeMatrix does ONE thing better than AUM in AUv3 territory and I beg AUM to take note and implement the same behavior as it really would make the app quite better:  ApeMatrix will let you resize AUv3 plugins just like AUM does, but the huge advantage to ApeMatrix is that these AUv3 modules remember their position on screen even after being closed. Unfortunately AUM does not do this; this means everytime you open multiple AUm3 instances you have to organize them on your screen whereas on ApeMatrix you do that once and it‚Äôs set for the whole project. This allows ApeMatrix to work better as a AUv3 host as I can simply use this app in conjunction with my midi keyboard and pads to trigger opening such plugins whenever I need to have them on sight.   The second detail is that double clicking on the ‚Äúedge‚Äù of a plugin‚Äôs window in ApeMatrix automatically makes it full screen: AUM does the same but if you double click again it RESETS its UI, as opposed to ApeMatrix which preserves the ‚Äúminimized UI‚Äù and leads you back to it once you double click on the edge again.   This is also amazing and should be implemented in AUM as it allows for one to have multiple ‚Äúmini AUv3‚Äù plugins which you can maximize to have full control of through the screen only when needed.   These are two small requests that could potentially make AUM even better.  Otherwise, this is a great app and a friendlier  version of AudioBus, also sleeker (you‚Äôll probably need both in the long run tho, and also ApeMatrix. Best 3 mixers out there)."
"10693",1055672607,"I really like this game, it‚Äôs really fun and helpful to relax. But the button for buying no ads doesn‚Äôt work, no matter how many times I press it. I‚Äôd be fine with paying for this but it doesn‚Äôt work! :( Please fix it!"
"10694",1055672607,"I would love the option to remove ads. It‚Äôs there but you can‚Äôt click it. FIX IT PLEASE. Other than that another fun game to play by Gram"

"10698",1055677337,"Great browser! I enjoy being able to use a browser know that I‚Äôm not being tracked or worry about cookies being added to my browser."
"10699",1055684003,"I really enjoy the game. I would like to have the ability to salvage the items i dont need into scrap metal or wood. Still great game"
"10700",1055684003,"I go back to this game about one month a year, it‚Äôs a good game in spurts like that, unfortunately can‚Äôt get my fill on the newest iPhone iteration. Crazy game breaking bugs on the iPhone X character walks off the screen never to be seen again. Camera never pans down. Make it playable for me again!"
"10701",1055684003,"I bought this on steam earlier today and I‚Äôm so glad they have a version for iOS. Not sure what some of these older reviews are, but I‚Äôve have no problems with running the game."
"10702",1055714800,"I paid a $1 for this after seeing it on Fox 19 News this morning. It's a shoddy app that just repeats the same phrase over and over again. Not to mention the abuse splash page you have to sit and click through every time you want to use it is just obnoxious."
"10703",1055714800,"The app claims it plays different messages but I've tried it on my own without the child around and it plays the same message every time. I don't think it's going to be believable after a couple of uses."
"10704",1055714800,"My kid flipped out when I told him it was bath time. I told him ""Santa's Watching"" and played the message and he got into the bath without a peep!  This is great!  I plan to use this all year, not just during the holidays."
"10705",1055825012,"I guess it's the most beautiful game, that I have ever played by Epix, so I leave 5 stars here, though after finishing it I wanted to reduce it to 4 ...too many glitches in the mini games, unfortunately. The graphics, the animation, the colors, the music, the landscapes, the costumes are just amazing! It's also a nice touch, that you can play Majong both instead of HOPs and in the Extras...The game is perfect, but the story is a little bit boring. Anyway, it's absolutely worth to buy it !"
"10706",1055825012,"Great game... Loved playing it... I've played lots and lots of big fish games and some of them are boring or too glitchy but this one was smooth and lots of fun!"
"10707",1055825012,"Please make more like this, was sooo entertaining!"
"10708",1056224570,"Keep saying bad connection no wifi or data"

"10711",1056364454,"I paid to not have ads a yr ago now they want me to pay again.Tried to send a email but keep getting a error message....and on top of that they charging a $7.49 fee for a wk who tf pays that not even Apple Music charge that much i want my mf money back"
"10712",1056364454,"I loved musictrax and recommended the app to all my friends until after I had a good collection of my favorite songs. Then Musictrax decided to hold my music hostage! They blocked me from my downloaded music and the only way I can hear them now is to agree to pay them $7.49 per WEEK! That‚Äôs nearly $400.00 a year. I can buy what I want other places and not worry about my music taken away! So no thanks Musictrax!!"
"10713",1056364454,"I use to love this app until the 7 free trial what ever happen just normal free music please fix the app and cancel the 7 free trial"

"10723",1056813463,"I am standing outside the Dunkin‚Äô Donuts I always order from which is open 24 hours and they don‚Äôt show as an option to order from on the app. I have used app in past to order, but last couple of weeks, my store has disappeared."
"10724",1056813463,"Needs to be fixed. Malfunctions constantly. Never got my birthday drink and I try to use religiously lol waste of good efforts."
"10725",1056813463,"The app has been acting very well for a while. Suddenly it keeps shutting itself down just after the screen logo pops up. I reinstalled it the first time; it was ok. Now it‚Äôs doing it again."
"10726",1056893074,"This app seems amazing and easy I love that it has all the foods listed to make shopping easier I just wish it connected to my Apple Watch for my exercise HIIT workouts which I do at a gym so it would be nice to have my watch track it for me but other then that it‚Äôs great"
"10727",1056893074,"I have found this app very useful for knowing what to eat at which meals/snacks.  Daily meals are linked to recipes which is super convenient.  Only had this 3 days but so far I have found it helpful."
"10728",1056893074,"I read the entire Dr. Phil 20/20 book.  This app is easy, but a few things are missing in the instructions.  For instance you need to have 2 cups of green tea a day and a large glass of water with each meal ... just saying.  But this app is much easier to use then the official one."
"10729",1056954483,"I don‚Äôt know what to say about Watch Games. It‚Äôs exactly what you get. It has 3 games on it, none of which are groundbreaking, obviously, but they‚Äôre fun little time-wasters. I guess I should give my opinion on each  Breakout- Not sure what this is called and I don‚Äôt have my Apple Watch on me right now, so I can‚Äôt remember the name, but essentially it‚Äôs just breakout but with upgraded graphics. Only complaint is sometimes the ball will be stuck only going across the X-Axis, making it just go side to side and essentially soft locking the game.   Defender-  Again, forget the name. I can‚Äôt recognize this game, so I‚Äôm going to assume it‚Äôs original. Basically, dodge asteroids, collect fuel and last as long as possible. The ship automatically goes to the side, so you just move the Digital Crown to move it up and down.   Viper-  THIS game‚Äôs name I remember. Just Snake but you move in 360¬∞.   All and all, it‚Äôs an ok app. I do wish there were score boards, they don‚Äôt even have to be online, just local. The game‚Äôs don‚Äôt count your score. But when scores is the worst thing about your game, you‚Äôre in a good position. All and all, I highly recommend downloading this app and just trying it out. It‚Äôs free, after all, not to mention there‚Äôs no ads. Mediocre, but in a good way. 9/10 (4/5 stars)."
"10730",1056954483,"Ok so I know the last time anything has been done to this game was a long time and with the new Apple Watch Series 4 44mm there is no lag but I would love to see a update to make it full screen in the Series 4 44mm.                                                          Thank you."
"10731",1056954483,"Games work but I can not move the items as I need to. I just paid $1.07 for a game to watch not play on my watch what a rip off."
"10732",1056968162,"I‚Äôm rating it 5 stars just so u can see it. Do not get."
"10733",1056968162,"I ABSOLUTELY LOOOVVE THIS GAME! just a couple requests  1: Can you please add youtubers such as SkyDoesMinecraft, LittleLizardGaming, and so on? They made toys but not the game, please add them  2: I hate this. Whenever I need to save up energy, it doesn't. I need to keep the app running and it takes up A LOT of my battery power running something I'm not using please fix these and I will rate it 5 Stars"

"10735",1056999701,"This game was by far one of my favorite VR games when it first came out. Unfortunately it looks like you guys stopped updating it. This really bothers me that is wont get any better and that is why I gave it 3 stars"
"10736",1056999701,"I wish more VR games supported mfi controllers. It blows me away that they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a shame the Google Cardboard is such a profoundly limiting platform; even the viewing angle suffers. With that said, it is an excellent game tarnished by some rather serious design flaws.   A huge part of the fun for a game like this is PILOTING a space ship and yet we can‚Äôt do this here. Instead, we hardly more than float through a dog fight while we shoot the baddies around us. I realize that this is an accommodation to the Cardboard platform but I really wish they had included a way to accelerate when using a game pad. Immersion suffers significantly because of it. Additionally, running out of ammo is just a stupid way to end a game.  Ultimately, the game offers an exciting taste of what the future of iOS gaming holds‚Äîbut just a taste."
"10737",1056999701,"This is how mobile vr is done people"
"10738",1057030968,"A super weather app. The clean design is easy to us and a pleasure to even get bad weather reports on."
"10739",1057030968,"While this is a decent free weather app, it heavily relies on my iPhone to work, if I‚Äôm out of range of my iPhone which I tend to be a lot it doesn‚Äôt work on its own through my watch it seems to need to have the app reopened on the phone to load any data. If this is fixed I‚Äôll redownload, for now I‚Äôve switched."
"10740",1057030968,"UI terrific. Generally very accurate weather, and good arrangement of the data on app, but the app loses two stars each for (1) excruciatingly slow loading and geolocating (15-20 seconds, if at all) ‚Äî very slow with WiFi download at decent 75 Mbps and Verizon the same ‚Äî and glacially slow loading of the widget (geez, it‚Äôs a widget and shouldn‚Äôt take 15 seconds to load); and, (2) the watch data is likewise slow to load and, in a recurrent bug, data such as temperature NEVER changes in the watch face complication or matches the forecast; plus, no multiple locations as with native weather app on watch.  All latest hardware and software. Not jail broken.  Very disappointing by developers.  This will be my last subscription on iPhone and iMac."

"10779",1057633985,"This would be a great app if there were some way to export the models."
"10780",1057673686,"The first time I played it it wouldn't let me finish the main game.  This time I was on a plane and managed to play the main part but cannot finish the bonus game. The story was ok but not as good as the other Grim Tales games. If you buy it however, be prepared to play the whole thing in one sitting though."
"10781",1057673686,"I touch the screen and it doesn‚Äôt do anything."
"10782",1057673686,"All the important things - map, characters, graphics, etc. u expect, but I am writing this because I'm thoroughly enjoying myself!  I'll come back later,  but, for now, just have fun!"
"10783",1057844059,"Love this game, this game is perfect in between breaks at work and during lunch.   Thank you !"
"10784",1057844059,"You kill zombie  and I like it there‚Äôs some challenges and I love it"
"10785",1057844059,"Awesome game üíØ"
"10786",1057870288,"Fun"
"10787",1057870288,"I got this game yesterday and it was an immediate hit for me and my friends. We all got this on our iPhones (6S) and it was a really addictive time waster. But then I tried to play it this morning and suddenly, it kept crashing. IDK why, so I texted my friends to see if they had the same problem. They checked their phone and sure enough, same thing. I really hope you guys fix this, because soon enough, the crash is going to be on all phones. This game is great overall and has potential, but I can never play it now since it always crashes."
"10788",1057870288,"I feel like they‚Äôre are tons of ads and lag.First time I got the game it crashed and redo downloaded.I have and Iphone 7 so it‚Äôs not my phone and I have good wifi and tons of space. I know the ads can be fixed by turning off the WiFi but the game can‚Äôt handle other apps running in the back."
"10789",1057889290,"The energy thing is stupid and it is just a way to make money. That is the only bad thing that they should change."
"10790",1057889290,"This is the best game I‚Äôve ever had"
"10791",1057889290,"Good for entertainment"
"10792",1057925633,"I like the game but you start to get lonely please add online so you can play with friends add them as a friend. communicate with them to please"
"10793",1057925633,"It's a very good game! If you have a very smol phone then it may be stuffy. But you'll get used to the game. It's very fun! I think it's worth the money. If you download this game and you think it's good write a review! I hope everyone will think it's a good game even more then good FANTASTIC! Although I think they should add stuff.       1. They should add where you can name the world.  Anything but that it's 100%! üíóüíó Love you toca boca! I think this is a good game and I'm only 7! Anyway great game üëç!"
"10794",1057925633,"The app is amazing 5/5 love it. So much to do and create. I just this when you enter through teleporting doors the worlds should be different. But anyway I wanted to give a suggestion for an app. I call it Toca Worlds. Your a little character who starts out on a planet (that you would name) and you get to create it. You get in a spaceship and explore more planets, and collect stuff from those plantets like aliens and just materials and bring them back to your planet and expirement with them to make objects and cool things to decorate your planet with and use throughout the game. You should be able to meet new creatures too.I think that would be so cool! Thank you, love your games so much and I think this game would be so good. üòÅüòÑüòÑ"
"10795",1057961675,"I hate this game I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôve deleted and downloaded this game 5 times I was hoping that you fixed the glitches but you haven‚Äôt so I just can‚Äôt play the game"
"10796",1057961675,"I think it needs more coins through out the maps so you can actually progress without wasting a whole lot of time, the graphics are better than hill climb but honestly not worth it to play."
"10797",1057961675,"Cool games"
"10798",1058023292,"I enjoyed it"
"10799",1058023292,"I liked this game.  It was certainly long enough for the cost, and the bonus game that came with it with fairly extensive as well.  Plot was good as well, which is not always true with these games.  about the only thing i didn't like was a minigame in the bonus section which is a side-scroller.  the controls were really terrible and frustrating."
"10800",1058023292,"Things one finds actually make sense, good story line, good hints. Only complaint is that the text is so small."
"10801",1058036662,"Can't get past the name screen. Which is too bad because this looks like a cool game."
"10802",1058036662,"Can‚Äôt start the game. This is a rip-off! I demand my money back, no such thing as free money!!!"
"10803",1058036662,"Paid for it because there isn‚Äôt a preview. Can‚Äôt even type in my name. Doesn‚Äôt work at all. Would like a refund."
"10804",1058355648,"I am addicted to this game and cannot stop playing! This game is the best game to learn how to drive and to stay inside the lines while driving. (To the Developer:) I wish you could add more cars and different weather driving conditions. And as well the cars are buggy and need to be fixed. There needs to be updates as well. But all looks good and the game is really fun!!!!"
"10805",1058355648,"This is a bad crsed game my chld wated this and I said sure my child the next day she that died this game cursed"
"10806",1058355648,"Honestly this game is pretty fun, the two things that I hate about it is the steering and the CONSTANT ADS literally anything I clicked on I had to watch a Ad before I could go to that menu"
"10807",1058370552,"I enjoy this game.  Gets harder as you go to higher levels.  I have found a few levels are tough without buying coins. Give it a try if you enjoy match three games. All I can say is that the game is  challenging and is lots of fun.  Good as a brain game.  Hooked on this one!"
"10808",1058370552,"Does not give my coins after quest!!"
"10809",1058370552,"This game has several bugs.  Looking at other reviews, several people have sited several.  The latest is the reward challenges for bonuses doesn‚Äôt award once challenge completed.  It says claim prize and when you hit the button.  The prize disappear and not awarded.  Yet the challenges still keep showing up."
"10810",1058526204,"I haven‚Äôt been getting any bots lately"
"10811",1058526204,"If you like transformers then you will like the game. After all that's what the game is about ""Transformers "". However since the game is about transformers why not spend a little of your hard earned $$ to get by our favourite bot? Well that spot the way this game works. From the bugs and randomness of the game you be other except it or move on. Bugs range from abilities bot working right to plain old bathing problems. Bots will wonder off or will attack walls. Better still is the commander setting a rush point and the bots totally ignore it. The bots ""appear"" when you get a crystal and pop it in tge space bridge. Well 1% of tge time you will get a bit you need. The others are duplicate or just some crap you already have. Free crystals give you more boosts than the usable stuff and the way the system works you are better off just not using them because they do not help in war. Some people will read this and say this person is way off but I played 3 years before I finally just gave it up adept this review. No more of my time or $$ on this game. So do yourself a favour and go to another game."
"10812",1058526204,"I‚Äôm a huge fan"
"10813",1058528141,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY A LOT OF HACKERS... this game steel your money and the hackers kick you out the game all the time when you destroy their tanks."
"10814",1058528141,"Unexpectedly addictive and fun."
"10815",1058528141,"My phone crashed. Got a new one.   Lost my rank. Tank. Coins. Everything. Contacted WM‚Äôs. Just got an add as a result.  Not satisfied. Also. The review posted in the app is a year old. Looks like the developers don‚Äôt care."
"10816",1058602106,"I paid to be able to save my progress because I felt like the game was worth it. honestly I love everything about this game, ESPECIALLY the storyline. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt give this app a 5 star review because of the absolute lack of technical support. About a week ago, the audio from the game disappeared. Absolute silence. Considering the fact that the audio is arguably one of the most important  aspects of game, it was pretty upsetting to have lost it. when I searched for technical support there actually wasn‚Äôt any. I was directed to the adult swim site which directed me back to the app. Seriously guys? I just want my audio back, some instruction, guidance, ANYTHING. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and ALL MY PROGRESS WAS LOST. WHAT THE F$&@?! Can anybody help me out?!?!"
"10817",1058602106,"I would give this a zero star rating if I could. You got me interested in this game then you threw down that we have to pay to keep our progress. Now I'm just mad. I'm going to delete this game immediately. Next time make one that's completely free And I might be interested. Ugh"
"10818",1058602106,"So its kinda cool that you can literally play this game from start to finish in 1 go. Unfortunately it will take up the whole day.  The comedy is very good especially the creators and the teacher level i got a kick out of.   If i do get enough to buy it, i will because i never did any of the extras."
"10819",1058603368,"This game is fantastic.  Especially great when you just need a quick brain stimulation.  It's easy to play and definitely tests what kinda risks you're willing to take.  Try it, it's fun!"
"10820",1058603368,"This game is boring at the beginning but the end is the most fun part."
"10821",1058603368,"Really fun game, for those complaining you have to start over from the beginning, that's part of the challenge. It starts slow and as it gets faster and adds more obstacles it becomes more challenging gradually. Wish it had a paid version to get rid of the adds though."
"10822",1058709520,"The top of my screen is covered so I can‚Äôt see my progress and it‚Äôs really inconvenient so I would like if it were fixed but besides that it‚Äôs a good game."
"10823",1058709520,"This is one of the best games I have ever played"
"10824",1058709520,"Good Game GG"

"10836",1058959277,"This is the most apoplectic app I have eve encountered. Please do not ever use Uber, they are a horrible business with worse customer service"
"10837",1058965051,"I read the reviews that said this game needs a map, but I don‚Äôt usually use the map so I didn‚Äôt pay much attention. This game really does need a map. Their isn‚Äôt much (or any) guidance about what to do next, and the hint button only works if you are in the right location already. The HOPs and mini games are fun, but overall the game is frustrating. I‚Äôm finding myself just trying to get through it as quickly as possible."
"10838",1058965051,"I enjoyed playing Eclipse.  It has an excellent length, good graphics, and some interesting puzzles.  On the other hand, it can be really annoying.  My biggest annoyance is the absence of a map.   There is no way to determine what is next and no way to transport to the next place.  As a result, I have spent endless amounts of time wandering aimlessly.  The hint button might has well have been absent since the only thing it tells you is ""you can't do anything here.""  While the strategy guide is excellent, you have to restart the game every time you use it. (And Big Fish needs to stop dumping multiple ads into its web site!) Overall, I'd give it a 3-star rating."
"10839",1058965051,"Good game but it is okay. No map. I have to use hint on where to find next."

"10845",1059195733,"I first saw this in book form while house sitting. I liked it so much I posted it on FB an a friend said she loved the app. An APP? I got this immediately. I need to figure out how to gift it!"
"10846",1059213655,"Videos cause it to crash, imported 4 photos and it gave me a circle on the screen and stayed there for 3 min and nothing happened. Worthless."
"10847",1059213655,"I purchased this app to make gifs out of photos on my phone, only to find that when you import photos it completely jumbled the order with NO way to edit it! I figured it must be a bug so I went to the ‚ÄúSend Feedback‚Äù option, only to find it wouldn‚Äôt let me with an error message saying I need a ‚Äòmail account‚Äô (whatever that means) and no options to make said account to be found. Very disappointing, these people just want your money by making you pay upfront. Get GifsArt instead‚Äî it‚Äôs free and lets you edit the timeline, and doesn‚Äôt screw up the order in the first place! Complete waste of money this app was, pretty sure the other reviews must be fake. Don‚Äôt get this app!"

"10856",1059309490,"This app is the best of virtual reality, because it's the only! It's great as a joke (which is its intent) so I don't understand why there's a bunch of people down voting this app. If it's bad, that's because it's meant to be!

"10862",1059401746,"The game is well constructed. However, unlike other games, the robot is destroyed by fierce machines at every turn until you solve the puzzle. The reflexes required are too challenging also, at least on my iPad. If the developers just made it a puzzle instead of a life and dismemberment situation for the robot, it would be a good game.  As it stands, I‚Äôm sorry I bought it, and I‚Äôm a big fan of monument valley, Mekorama, fix the factory, and ghost of memories (?).  When did we lose our sensitivity?"

"10912",1059911569,"I‚Äôve played all the free games so finally tried this paid game. While I think the game is worth the small cost, it‚Äôs somewhat disappointing.   The logic puzzles in ‚Äúhotel‚Äù seem simpler and more straightforward than in the free games. What‚Äôs frustrating is how much the ordering of events is relevant to getting a top score. The result is that beating the game involves a lot of rote repetition to order your actions optimally. This makes the game last longer but at a cost of tedium, particularly because the ordering is arbitrary and not clued in any way. In particular there‚Äôs at least one instance (2nd guest meal if done in correct order) where an item is required twice in order to get a perfect score - but one of the two actions makes the item unusable. So those two actions have to be done twice, for no reason other than arbitrary choice. (If the item remaine available to be picked up again, ordering wouldn‚Äôt matter.)"
"10913",1059911569,"These storylines are simple depraved.   Read some of the other critical reviews of these apps.  I enjoy these types of puzzle apps, but this one crosses the line of decency.    Personally, I would hope apple would remove the app from the app store."
"10914",1059911569,"So much fun.Not always easy and frustrating when you miss something and have to start from the beginning but absolutely brilliant. I‚Äôd rather pay for the ones that have ads but I get folk need to make money. Hurry up though. I‚Äôve played them all and need a new one!"
"10915",1060062637,"It‚Äôs pay to play eventually, early on. I‚Äôm on level 8 and it‚Äôs too hard to win. The enemies are overwhelming. Not sure why people are rating at 4.1. It has a lot of potential but it gets difficult quickly and there are no ways to advance in cash, silver to upgrade, etc. You have to pay and I‚Äôm not going to....DELETE ** Also, it‚Äôs the wrong screen format for the iPad Pro 12.9"

"10929",1060103787,"Keep it up great game :D"
"10930",1060178390,"It reminds me of NES days when gameplay was more important than graphics. The pixel art is amazing though, don't get me wrong. The pets, crafting, battles, are all solid. Well done! One of my favorite ios games already."
"10931",1060178390,"This game is fun but some of the enemies are annoying like the living lava and can we get more classes to play with like a monk or a barbarian"

"10934",1060276201,"Terrifying. Necessary. It‚Äôs probably easier than you think. Getting out of flow state is my problem, weirdly enough. Once I start writing, I get in such a compulsive state of flow, I can‚Äôt make myself stop typing even when I want to. I use this to train myself by letting the writing fade. It‚Äôs a backwards way to use it, but it took that problem I had and neutralized it down to ...what is now, in terms of writing ... not my issue, but my edge.   But if you want to be in flow-state, just do this until you‚Äôre no longer monitoring yourself, let anything come out, and don‚Äôt feel the need to read it again. It‚Äôs a good way to purge mental clutter, to learn things you didn‚Äôt know you thought about, to get some weird poetic dream-like writing (if you‚Äôre into that) or just to see what happens. Sometimes I like to write the best thing I‚Äôve ever written, and let it almost disappear. Don‚Äôt do that though....it‚Äôs probably not healthy lol. üòè  To do this without this app (sorry developers) use a pad and pen and try not to let the pen leave the page... or stop moving, even if you are just scribbling for a minute, it‚Äôs the same effect minus the panic attacks from the documents disappearing. This app is genius ... I wish more developers did these cool little niche interest apps. üëçüèªüôèüèª"
"10935",1060276201,"I have written in this app every day for years, on iOS and OSX, and absolutely loved it, would have given it 6 stars. When I upgraded to Mojave, the Mac app ceased to work, eating my words before it was supposed to, with no warning. Anyone know if the developer has kept up better with this iOS version?"
"10936",1060386658,"Does not work on watch which is the only reason I got it, not worth the money."
"10937",1060386658,"I have countless apps like this one. The reason I purchased this app was that I could use it across all my devices including my new AppleTV. I will always support developers that make fully universal apps when I can."

"10939",1060433597,"This is by far my favorite game like this I have so much fun playing but it‚Äôs really annoying having to wait on the ball to go back and forth. You have the mechanic with the pink spring that can be helpful but it doesn‚Äôt always work. Put in a mechanic that we can use at all times to pull the balls back and move on to the next throw. Thank you"
"10940",1060433597,"Love this game.  Because balls are so different, it would be fantastic to have a high score for each ball type as well as overall best score."

"10942",1060443742,"I like to read an actual forecast for weather and not see a simplistic layout trying to be mod with just icons and a lot of white space devoid of any details.   A choice of a dark theme would be nice."
"10943",1060443742,"Need to add weather maps and alerts.  So close to being a great program but not quite there."
"10944",1060443742,"Description sounded good but app did not deliver. No maps, all text, no good. But I hope my $1.99 went to a good cause. Free weather apps all over the place are much, much better. Even my local TV station app is light years ahead of this."
"10945",1060599603,"For a game that takes a lot of random tapping, it crashes too much. I never knew if I was doing the wrong thing or if the game had frozen. Some of the puzzles were fun and creative. There is a lot of repetition. Three stars because it was not a total waste of time, but it needs work."
"10946",1060599603,"Good game! I love the challenges and the wordplay; the only aspect I found annoying was the limited keys/hints. Other than that, 10/10, I would play again!"

"10962",1061009889,"Those that love the game yet want more, giving you less than 5-stars should really discontinue reviewing games, it's not fair to the developers.

However having a option to turn on the ""hint"" system permanently would be a good move for ppl who didn't grow up playing these kinds of games.  There are a few points were you can get stuck if you miss something, but as long as you stick with it and think it through, you'll get it!   There are some small bugs(characters pics will sometimes not show up in the frame when they're talking, for example)  but nothing that got in the way of finishing the game.     One more thing, I wish the new game button was farther, or underneath or something(!) from the continue one, I accidentally restarted my game three times, once when I was halfway thru  üòñ  very frustrating!"
"11030",1061960628,"Beautiful, but: Buggy Super short (45m)"
"11031",1061960628,"Not long but reasonable length, interesting story. I will definitely watch for the sequel. Took me a while to find the elevator button in the very beginning, after that I rarely got stuck by not finding something to tap. Jo, did you search the bathroom?"
"11032",1061999170,"Literally all I have to say is the controls are not sensitive enough. Add an option to change the dead zone."
"11033",1061999170,"This is a game that takes 10 seconds to learn, but can be played forever. Super impressed. Monetization is not too egregious either. Five stars"
"11034",1061999170,"I loved this game but I got bored of it for a while so I uninstalled it but I kept wanting to play the game so I went into the App Store to redownload it but I realized I forgot the name and I have finally found it as we speak"
"11035",1062002361,"How can I edit if I can‚Äôt even split a video??"
"11036",1062002361,"4K editors are difficult to find and this one answers the call for professionals on the go..."
"11037",1062002361,"I like everything thus far. If you all could add a blur effect to blur out certain items in the clips, like car tags or anything else you may not want exposed in a video, that would be great!"
"11038",1062006344,"Nice app & Fun but they need to fix colors fading"
"11039",1062006344,"I‚Äôm sorry the cost to color with this app is outrageous. After all it‚Äôs just supposed to be adult coloring right?  Spend your money on a real coloring book, some crayons and colored pencils and be happy coloring for a lot less money."
"11040",1062006344,"I know it says cancel anytime but why not allow the free trial without the auto renew."
"11041",1062166395,"I admit there were times I would watch an ad to get another chance or a revive on an auto death but since I paid for a boost that is NO LONGER AN OPTION?? I‚Äôm losing an assist because I paid. Well forget that. SO UNHAPPY NOW."
"11042",1062166395,"Keep running out of levels and takes weeks to get new ones"
"11043",1062166395,"Lots of fun and my nickname is TBEAR!!!"
"11044",1062168249,"I have been trying for several days to get on server 18 but it never works."
"11045",1062168249,"Pretty good"
"11046",1062168249,"This app is just a cover to steal your money! In app purchases are a joke and Joyfort, the developers know this and hope that if they ignore your complaints long enough you‚Äôll go away! I highly recommend you steer way clear of anything with Joyfort as a developer!"
"11047",1062307524,"So, if there are any video editors wondering if they should buy it do not. It is pretty good for picture editing though."
"11048",1062307524,"As a Star Wars nerd, this is a great and easy app to use, very fun and addicting! The only thing I think would make this better would be the ability to erase the sabers you add, or if you had a saber passing through something!"
"11049",1062307524,"Bull crap. Worst app I have ever downloaded."
"11050",1062318595,"The movement feels just too floaty. Also the virtual dpad takes up too much space so when trying to move to shots on the left it becomes difficult to see. It didn‚Äôt try the touch controls because I want something similar to arcade controls like virtua tennis."
"11051",1062318595,"It‚Äôs a bad game"
"11052",1062318595,"This game is very fun but I feel it‚Äôs time for a new season with new changes. After playing for a while it can get boring and I found myself losing interest for the career mode. I wish there was a tournament in the career mode for the olympics and I also wish that the career mode could be more realistic and hands on."
"11053",1062475106,"this has been a consistent issue for the year and a half that I've had this app and I've tried saying something before but nothing changed. overall I love this app but I really wish that this would get fixed"

"11055",1062475106,"For $0.99 I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but I was expecting it to at least show up on my watch.  After uninstalling and reinstalling it still did show up at all in the watch app."
"11056",1062642163,"You have to be observant with this game. I just live it."
"11057",1062642163,"One word to describe this game - outstanding. This is my first Glitch game and if they are all this well made, I am excited to play all the rest! The graphics are great, gameplay is smooth, puzzles are very challenging, yet fun, and the game is just a super fun game. I‚Äôve been playing for 3 hours straight and I‚Äôm not even close to being finished. If you are looking for a fun and challenging point and click, escape type game with good puzzles, give this game a try. You will totally LOVE it.  Edit: I just played A Short Tale AGAIN and it was just as fun as the first time I played it. I absolutely love this cute game."
"11058",1062642163,"A Short Tale is the 6th Glitch Game that I have played, and it is one of their best. The puzzles were a nice balance between clever and fiendish, with a few being maybe a little too close to fiendish. (I am looking at you Magic 8 Ball!) I liked the change in tone from the darker elements of Forever Lost, as this game is one that I would let my younger kids try out. I also thought the smaller environment within one room was a nice change of pace as it meant that you did not have to travel far to investigate a new clue or to search for the next clue. Looking forward to more offerings from Glitch."
"11059",1062745479,"Interface is much improved and easier to digest now"
"11060",1062745479,"Excellent Application"
"11061",1062745479,"Love this app, all of the info is so useful.  I have a few health issues and this helps me track and record any issues or progress I may have."
"11062",1062765947,"It‚Äôs a great relaxing game to play"
"11063",1062765947,"I love this game so much!! It's one of my favorite apps. The graphics are adorable and it's not glitchy at all. The characters are cute and the game is very addicting. I play it all the time but my only concern is that the orca whale character is reversed when used. Again, I also find it slightly annoying that you get extra coins when getting a high score. Thanks for reading!"
"11064",1062765947,"When I started this game I was so happy I don't think any game will past this game I love it so so much please do other ones like this.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"11065",1062825798,"It's pretty good"
"11066",1062825798,"I just rated for the coins but it's still a good game"
"11067",1062825798,"The game is very cool but there should be a lot more cars and you should be able to change the color of the cars and mace."
"11068",1062825806,"This game makes no sense to me.üë∫üë∫üë∫üë∫üë∫üë∫üë∫üë∫üë∫"
"11069",1062825806,"its fun at first but gets annoying and boring and the ads ugh"
"11070",1062825806,"it's pretty impossible to play, there is lag. it looks like they put a lot of effort into designing this game, but not actually testing the gameplay."
"11071",1062834129,"Awesome arcade games!!! Reminds me of puzzle fighter"
"11072",1062834129,"This game is a puzzle game in which you struggle to not enjoy the art so you don't explode from incompetence.  Pros:  The art is really good at being simple, recognizable, and humorous. (If you get to look at it for more than the split second it allows) The animation is simple and effective (which you won't notice because you are busy looking at the cars) There is a surprising array of cars on display. From the VW party bus to the Bugatti, the sprites in this game do an accurate depiction of famous vehicles.   Cons: If you struggle with pattern recognition you will not enjoy this game. Tight time limits make finding the cars on this ever changing board a challenge. Not to mention you can't even enjoy your robot punching a huge plant-crab-fish-Dino in the eye :( Customizing your robot does not change the cars on the board or abilities you use. You will skip Cutscenes, especially the combining one in every level.  This game is worth the .99 it asks for, however it probably will not keep you for very long."
"11073",1062834129,"REMOVE THE ADS. Unacceptable."
"11074",1062945251,"This app reminds me to begin my day with gratitude. It sets the tone for the day. The evening reminder creates a practice of finding the moments to be grateful for even on a challenging day."
"11075",1062945251,"Dvelopers: Please, let us edit morning and evening prompts!"
"11076",1062945251,"This is so much handier & easier to keep up with than a paper journal plus you never run out of room or paper!üòç"
"11077",1063149922,"I love this game. Would easily get 5 stars if they would fix a problem in all the reindeer drop screens. If you solve it on the last hand, it registers as a loss, not a win. The reindeer screen is the only place I‚Äôve found that this happens. Also, App support doesn‚Äôt get you anywhere or I would have reported it. Like many others, I appreciate that you don‚Äôt get stuck on a level forever. That makes the game enjoyable. Many other games I‚Äôve dropped for that one reason."
"11078",1063149922,"Cute game and fun.  The ads are way too distracting."
"11079",1063149922,"I love how there is a mixture of easy and more challenging levels.  I hate how most games get more challenging the higher levels you get to making me eventually delete that game.  My only complaint is I wish I could play it on my IPad horizontal or vertical.  Keep up with the mixture of hard and easy levels, love it!  I even paid to get rid of ads!  Thank you!"
"11080",1063166978,"So I like quidd and I don‚Äôt have an issue with it mostly, but they don‚Äôt have sword art online stickers! They have most common shows but shows that aren‚Äôt as well known don‚Äôt get recognition at all! I understand that it might be hard but, I don‚Äôt know maybe a function where people can make their own stickers would be nice!"
"11081",1063166978,"The game was really fun when I had it but when I deleted it and forgot the password for my account i tried to reset it and I‚Äôve still  haven‚Äôt gotten any emails to reset it it‚Äôs been 4 months"
"11082",1063166978,"I‚Äôve had this app for a while and it‚Äôs been great but there are a few problems and I‚Äôll list some things I‚Äôd like to be added  -I‚Äôd like to be able to sell multiple items at once -Auto-removal of sold/expired listings. I am 12 and my mom has set the new iOS ‚ÄúScreen Time‚Äù limit on my phone and it takes up a lot of time to get rid of all the listings  That‚Äôs pretty much all I have say about this app and other than that I give it 4 stars and one ok hand ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüëåüèª"

"11084",1063191689,"Bought out ads because I liked your game and wanted to support you. Except I‚Äôm still constantly harassed to watch ads for extra stuff. Honestly just wanted to play this game and enjoy it."
"11085",1063191689,"So don‚Äôt get me wrong the game is funny but after about 1 and a half hours it‚Äôs not that fun you see I‚Äôm going on a 10 hour trip we are driving to l a and sandiago and I‚Äôm trying to get as much games that don‚Äôt need internet as possible"
"11086",1063194066,"Can you make a new game called ultimate mythical creature simulator with Greek mythology animals with medusa and phoenix and The Minotaur can you add griffins and can you add the hippogriff can you are that three headed snake (I don‚Äôt know the name of that three headed snake but can you make a King cobra) can you add the Loch Ness monster can you add that giant spider   can you add goblins too(all these animals I wanted you to add on this new simulation game is all the animals that people can be in the game and if you can‚Äôt add  Medusa could you add fairys and if you can‚Äôt could you add skeleton birds and I‚Äôm reminding you the second time all these animals I‚Äôm asking you to add in the game are playable) now for the bosses can you add medusa as a boss can you add a hydra as a boss too and the last boss can you add the Kracken  anyways I‚Äôm giving u A idea to add this game so can you add this game please"
"11087",1063194066,"So, I think this game is overall good, though, it is a bit hard building a nest, and sometimes, when I‚Äôm being attacked, the attacker flies up to me! Anyways, the game is pretty good for wasting some time as a random bird. I recommend it  Another thing, I keep hearing people wanting a warrior cat simulator, and I‚Äôm pretty sure that can‚Äôt happen without the authors permission so, yeah"
"11088",1063194066,"I love your game but two complaints I have are: 1. Perching. Sometimes, when I get back to flying position from perching, I can‚Äôt move. It‚Äôs so annoying, and 2. Building a nest. When I have sticks in my mouth, when I try to fly back to build nest, I keep flying up. I don‚Äôt understand why. Not just that, but I have a suggestion. An ‚ÄúUltimate Human Simulator‚Äù! I‚Äôve always wanted one to come out, but every one I play, it has levels. I hate life simulator games with levels! So I would be so glad if you made one! Other than that, the game is amazing! Keep up the good work!"
"11089",1063317238,"This is a very nice game and very fun!! Except when I try to get a certain cube it gives me a totally different oneüòêüòê"
"11090",1063317238,"This game is absolute trash the blocks fall so fast and whenever i tap my cube doesn't move please nobody install this garbage game"
"11091",1063317238,"This game has the potential to be very fun and very addicting if only they had an easy medium, difficult mode. The blocks fall way too fast, it makes it really hard to get far in the game:/ like REALLY hard lol, please make the cubes fall slower!!"
"11092",1063637102,"I purchased the heavy chopper and the price showed 0.99, but can‚Äôt figure out how I was charged just under 10$. Also the ads did not go away."
"11093",1063637102,"Can‚Äôt play unless you allow them access to your personal data."
"11094",1063637102,"This is an amazing game (and I'm kind of addicted to it) but it has its flaws...  Things to fix: 1. During (and after) a survival mode game there is no GUI... Which means that after the game it is just a blank screen and during the game there is no joystick or pause button, this can easily be fixed by double clicking the home button, swiping the game and re-entering.  2. After playing an ad (video part) it goes to a blank white screen and you are unable to do anything on screen, this can be fixed the same way as #1.  There are probably more flaws but these are the flaws that I found."
"11095",1063780668,"Goodgame"
"11096",1063780668,"This Game Is Really Good TBH (to be honest) You Should Get This Game.But It Is A Little Challenging."
"11097",1063780668,"It had 5 stars so I decided to make it less..."
"11098",1063781546,"The gameplay is great, the difficulty gradient is great, and it reminded me of two of my favorite childhood melodies!"
"11099",1063781546,"I am so thankful this app exists ‚Äî it combines many of my favorite things all in one app!  ‚ö´Ô∏è Great Music ‚ö´Ô∏è Retro Graphics ‚ö´Ô∏è Epic Animations ‚ö´Ô∏è Easy, Intuitive Controls üîò ALL OF THE ABOVE!  The ONLY feature I wish was implemented was Ô£øiCloud Sync; there have been a couple times where I have had to reset/restore my devices, and none of the data was saved.  With that, if you want to play across multiple devices ‚Äî Ô£øiPhone, Ô£øiPad, Ô£øtv ‚Äî you will start from scratch on each device the first time you play; the only restored data is Ô£øGameCenter achievements."
"11100",1063781546,"I‚Äôm not usually much of a rhythm game fan but this one is really fun. The game is pretty easy and relaxing to play. The songs are all classical music which adds to the serenity. I‚Äôd recommend playing this games with headphones on‚Äîthe soundtrack is amazing! I really like the retro looking graphics too. The retro style is played to death in a lot of games these days but this one seems to pull it off well. If I had to change something I‚Äôd make more levels available to play for free but it still gives a nice preview of what the rest of the game is like. If you like rhythm games and classical music this is definitely worth trying out. I‚Äôd like to play the other songs at some point but I‚Äôm still mastering the first set. I look forward to seeing more updates in the future and possibly more songs."

"11110",1064093693,"So deliciously frustrating as addicting"
"11111",1064093693,"Overall, I enjoyed this game, but it has annoying bug where it sometimes will get stuck in the screen where you can choose which level to play. The workaround is to kill and relaunch the app. This happened 3 or 4 times over the course of completing the entire game. (This is on an iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.2.)  That said, I would still recommend this game to anyone who‚Äôs a fan of the genre. It has a somewhat original concept where your character can walk on any surface, and whatever surface it is currently walking on becomes ‚Äúdown.‚Äù The levels have a nice progression from easy to hard (but never become super difficult). I also appreciated the lack of adds and in-game purchases."
"11112",1064093693,"This is a simple and addictive game.   It is challenging enough to keep your attention.  The different challenges on each level are nice.   I want more stages please."
"11113",1064165938,"although not stimulus based questions, these trivia questions truly help get the facts stuck in your head, wonderful appüëåüèº thanks Tom Richey"
"11114",1064165938,"I started using this app a couple months before the AP Euro test, and it was effective in helping me get super solid on my timelines and ‚Äògotcha!‚Äô type facts. Ended up getting a five with a combination of this app, another review guide, and making flash cards by myself."
"11115",1064165938,"Simple and effective! A great tool to review for my AP Euro year tomorrow."
"11116",1064216828,"Banned r/legoyoda while actual hate subs are still up, they have. Retarded the admins are, run them over in my 2001 Honda Civic, I must."

"11119",1064362767,"Crashes every time I try and add a temperature trigger"
"11120",1064362767,"Doesn‚Äôt work very well with iPhone X. Honestly, the variety of options that came with the HUE app were much better, and it was free. Every time I try and add a new device it just shuts me out of the program.... Not what I expected for $15.00, hopefully you guys can upgrade this a little bit, add more features like themes, even if they were additional cost to the app at least there will be a variety of choices I can go through instead of having to pick a very simple theme, and adjust the colors myself. Also, I was under the impression that this connects all devices into one app.... Maybe I misunderstood that."
"11121",1064362767,"App crashes on start up on iPhone X, 11.2.1"
"11122",1064421107,"This game is so good. It‚Äôs fun and addictive and the fact that it‚Äôs a paid app is excellent. I really enjoyed this. If you like rally games, buy this!"
"11123",1064421107,"The mechanics and physics of the game make this feel like an actual attempt at a racing game. EA made the perfect mobile racing game, the controls make sense for a phone and are easy to use. Thank you thank you EA."

"11131",1064676206,"There must be a bug. It won‚Äôt even allow me to select a photo from my album."
"11132",1064676206,"This is by far the best photo enhancement app I have ever used. It is so much better than anything else I have ever seen in automatically and intelligently making your photos BETTER not just different that there really is nothing else out there that even comes close. When I see the lower reviews I realized that sometimes the reviews are just worthless. This isn‚Äôt a goofy Snapchat filter. It‚Äôs a serious digital portrait enhancement. Nothing else comes close.  The only thing I have found to criticize is that the AI algorithm has trouble with tilted faces or faces turned too far in any one direction. Maybe some of the reviews are from people who didn‚Äôt know that? Because then the program just doesn‚Äôt do anything except affect the tint a little bit. Pick a picture where you are looking more directly at the camera and you will see the magic. Takes 10-20 years off perfectly and instantly."
"11133",1064676206,"So far it works as advertised on my iPhone 8 Plus and I haven‚Äôt had any issues except one. I had iTunes running in the background and this app turned the volume all the way down.  After closing the selfie app the volume stayed all the way down. I couldn‚Äôt figure it out and even restarted my phone. My music wasn‚Äôt playing and then I noticed the volume was minimized. I tested it and opened Selfie again and it did the same. It‚Äôs normal to attenuate or stop audio playback when camera apps are opened, but this is something that should be fixed"
"11134",1064883436,"You need to add a way to remove ads.  Most ads are not age appropriate.  It‚Äôs a shame that you‚Äôve ruined what would be a great app with constant full screen add interruptions."

"11139",1064885978,"I only downloaded the game so I could review the reviews! Rather, I really just wanted to respond to the 3rd review post. Not including my review, there are only three other reviews total, so this is clearly something I am sure will not be relevant for many; yet here I am making it relevant by making my thoughts known! I also like to just waste font on a daily basis....so this is also fueled by my desire to waste a crap load of font by leaving amazingly helpful or not even relevant reviews of the reviews of the game! Here is my review of the reviews. None of the reviews were helpful at all, so my review will not be helpful at all when it comes to the terms of the game! But I did learn that the person who posted the 3rd review really goes overboard about the use of the word 'raped' in the 1st review that was posted. FYI-if you hope someone to die and never reproduce because they posted 'get raped' in a review, you should take a class in ""not swearing or hoping death upon other posts"", because that is kind of stupid to say since it is pretty much a given that reproduction is moot point after you die, so to say ""i hope you die and never reproduce"" is a big waste of font, and I am not a big fan of people who are habitual wasters of font; I also despise hypocrisy of all forms! I am privy of the fact that no one will ever read this post in its entirety, and thus they shall never see the waste of font I threw out into the interweb and the cyber highways of our digital world, but that is the life of a font wasting outlaw lie myself and you never know where I may show up next (or shall I say 'pop' up) or what review for an app or game I will review? Where will I waste font in my reviewing the past/prior reviews!!! Philosophy ninja OUT!!"

"11156",1065127755,"I recognize that this is a story first that gives a glimpse of a very beautiful culture and people with rich traditions. Thank you for sharing. The game play is side scrolling. I do like the integrated story and documentary aspects of the game best."

"11168",1065289089,"Is there a way to get a refund I thought this was a realistic flight sim not a potato"
"11169",1065289089,"This is the worst game I've ever played in my life and I've seen quite a few. The sensitivity is way too high and I cannot seem to change that and the speed on the Jets are just ridiculous you should make flying games like aircraft carrier. That's my favorite plane game."
"11170",1065354746,"This app is so amazing because you can change speed and pitch together or change the speed separately from the pitch. Although this app is great, I do have some ideas that would make this app extra amazing. First, I wish you can change the pitch separately from the speed. Last, I wish you could change the speed and pitch or change the speed and pitch separately from each other in real time while playing the audio clip.  I would very much appreciate that. I would be very thankful if you guys brought those two ideas I explained about earlier."
"11171",1065354746,"I‚Äôve been looking for an app to speed up videos for school. Not only is it easy to speed up the videos, you can keep the voice pitch the same!!! No chipmunk voice! Definitely recommend !"

"11179",1065511007,"Spotify with boom together are an amazing combination the clearest music i ever played, i wish apple music didn‚Äôt have restrictions you can‚Äôt use the equalizer but with spotify is a major go!"
"11180",1065511007,"I purchased a Boom for my MacBook originally, and then after getting an iPhone I really remember that the sound quality of the Mac Application truly blew me away. I don‚Äôt like how Boom will suddenly stop working and I will hear nothing at all when changing songs or music in Spotify. It does not happen all the time, but it has happened enough to make me want to search for other apps. I want to have a seamless experience where I can smoothly transition from one song to another or pause without having to take my iPhone out and have to effectively disconnect my headphones or change the settings in Boom to get the sound to work. When I‚Äôm working and listening to music with Boom and it abruptly fails, it is a time consuming process for me to have to troubleshoot the app. If the developers can fix this, then I will absolutely purchase a subscription to Boom. Other than that, I have to say that it‚Äôs an excellent equalizer."
"11181",1065511007,"I‚Äôve purchased the subscription and I still can not get into the app. My trial has six days left but every time I attempt to press continue nothing happens. Please fix ASAP this is absolutely ridiculous."

This app is such a waste of time! I wasted 3 hours trying to figure out how to get the mods to work and I never did figure it out even after watching multiple YouTube videos on how to get this app to work I never figured it out!

"11194",1065623382,"This is a really cute and humorous app. Great for kids and adults as other reviews have suggested. The problem is your child has to wait through a ""loading"" screen between each scene (and scenes only last 30 seconds or less). Furthermore, the app would (regularly) get to a loading screen and just hang there indefinitely. I had to force quit the app to get it to run again, and you have to start at the very beginning of the story each time you start the app back up (fortunately there's a menu you can access to jump to ""chapters"" in the story).  I'm giving this app a one star review because of the inability to play through without hitting the occasional indefinite load screen (and thereby having to force quit the app). I really hope they provide an update to address this soon because the app is really fun to play otherwise."

"11216",1065906948,"I think that this app is super fun and addicting. You don‚Äôt have to buy the characters with real money but you unlock them with points you earn in the game.

"11228",1066111223,"This one was easiest for me, the puzzles were great and I figured them out without a walkthrough. I love Goro Sato‚Äôs games! If you are looking for a cool, challenging and fun escape game, this is it! Definitely give it a try. 5 stars!!!"

"11231",1066135421,"I don't normally write reviews and especially, a negative one but, it's a waste of money, even if it's 99c and I already deleted the game... At the very first level, one minute into the game am unable to bypass some silly meaningless not engaging or thought provoking challenge (jump over some silly canyon) and... every single time I 'fail' I get a message asking me to 'start a game from start' or 'load saved game' and each single time I have to select the option. The game might be beautiful (from the developer pictures and the video) but, whoever came up the idea of having those options popping up each time you can't bypass a so called challenge? Shame as the game looked beautiful. I guess there is a reason one there is not one review for this game, lesson learned."

"11233",1066322956,"At first, I thought that the few numbers of features of the app make it simple to use, and I can move some of my essential daily todos to this app ( from Things ). But in the first week, I got disappointed. It lacks some of the necessary features, the stacked UX is not good, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me as I expected."
"11234",1066322956,"Please update app, I keep getting things I written erase has I‚Äôm typing them or when I‚Äôm done and I have to write it again. Sometimes happens 3 times in a row on the same sentence!"
"11235",1066322956,"I bought this because I liked the idea of subtasks, but it‚Äôs honestly a useless app because adding tasks leaves your home screen blank unless it is currently due. So if you add three tasks to complete by tomorrow night, you won‚Äôt see them unless you navigate to the ‚Äúsee all tasks pane‚Äù - which defeats the purpose to me. Literally any other free task app is more useful than this. I‚Äôm going to ask for a refund because my money would be better spent on one of those claw vending machines. Even if I get nothing, the experience would still be worth more than this app."

My son was unable to collect stars and play the games as this was a newer feature and my app won't update so I repurchased one of the books out of the bundle.

"11276",1067596534,"I sure hope they do nothing more to this app than update it for changes in the iOS!  Perfect little app with the simplicity of fewer choices that allow you to go in, do what you planned to do and move on."
"11277",1067596534,"Review update:  Please update the app for the latest screen sizes.  Pleeeaaase.  Original:  The app is top rate and notch!  Really enjoying it.  For me it is missing one thing which is the ability to put a circle or box around things you are wanting to annotate.  Thanks so much for creating this app.  It is appreciated."

"11284",1067720154,"Doesn't quite give you the exhilarating feeling I was hoping for. Not a very good sense of control.  More like an interactive installation than a game except it's frustrating haha. The creators should learn from Chameleon Run. That is an awesome and beautiful game."

"11290",1067860796,"Like a lot of other people, this app tricked me into paying full price for a year- and apple refused to refund me. I felt like it must have been my fault- maybe I didn‚Äôt read the fine print- but now I‚Äôve seen all the other reviews saying that they too were tricked out of their $ so unfortunately it looks like I‚Äôm not the only one. The app was so full of glitches that I couldn‚Äôt use it."

I canceled my gym membership and meditation apps because Asana Rebel is all you need for total mind, body, spirit wellness.

"11294",1067891186,"I really enjoyed this app when it first came out. My friends on iOS really had fun utilizing the cool features. It was even more fun once it was available to Android. Time has passed and no one I know logs on anymore - but I do. It‚Äôs probably the only safe haven for me. I could make private account on other social media to journal and vent on but I‚Äôve been using this for so long it‚Äôs all I know. I would be happy if it was around for a long time. If there was a way to export my posts and comments if it is ever removed from the Apple store I‚Äôd be grateful. Thanks for giving me a place to enjoy sharing with my friends and a place where I can simply be me."

"11306",1068076031,"Never win bonus always stuck in first game"
"11307",1068076031,"It‚Äôs a great game, except for the dragon levels. It‚Äôs not quite fair to be pitted against the dragon , first level 300 vs 700; second level 300 vs 1000; 3rd level 300 vs 1700. The player should have more on each level to make it fairer competeion. That‚Äôs my only negative response. Otherwise , I love the game."
"11308",1068100966,"Pretty good app. A little hard but that‚Äôs good because I won‚Äôt be done in two seconds. I have not found any glitches so it‚Äôs really cool."
"11309",1068100966,"Nice graphics. Some puzzles were fun but a couple make little sense even after seeing the walkthrough. The happy/sad one, for example, I don't see how anyone figures out without guessing.  It's just one room and then it's over -- but I was kind of glad there were no more after shaking my head at so much of it!"

"11312",1068110571,"Eh it‚Äôs pretty good, but if you want the better stuff you have to pay"
"11313",1068110571,"Amazing I love it !!"
"11314",1068204657,"I really do enjoy this game! It‚Äôs fun and the right amount of interactive. My only issue is the need to spend your own money for certain story lines. Like, why should I have to spend close to 1000 diamonds on a violin and an owl to progress the story, when I wouldn‚Äôt even want them in the first place. I downloaded then game again after leaving it for a while, and I think this was the exact reason why."
"11315",1068204657,"I love the game but the prices for equipment and to style your cafe are getting ridiculous. I can't even finish the challenge because I don't have enough money to upgrade a machine.   I already do the phone orders. By the time I earn the money the challenge is over. Like now I can't purchase the new machine to complete the challenge because I don't have enough money because I used the money to upgrade the last new machine üôÑüò°. So now I won't be able to complete the orders for this new challenge because it requires the new machine to complete. I play this game literally everyday!!!"
"11316",1068204657,"Soo... i got one problem in this game and i also saw online on some forums where people are reporting a similar problem. The game is good, however, the experience your server or barista gains after serving a customer is really out of sync. I tested it out. Your barista serves a customer and customer pays you gold. In return, we get 1 exp. so i closed the app overnight and saw in the morning that i had earned more than 200 gold and all you get is still, 1 exp. this is annoying. Really annoying and it takes forever to level up.  More exp should be provided."
"11317",1068236871,"Downloaded. Opened. It was like I went back to the iPhone 1. All you do is click through some prompts. I use the browser. It is terrible as well but I use it because it is the best out there. Covenant I love you guys but you are far far behind. Even the new screen accountability isn‚Äôt hitting the mark. We need an updated browser one that works well. We want to use you and you help us but please work to keep up with the times."
"11318",1068236871,"Glad they made this app, but next version needs to improve on some big bugs.   1) navigating away from app (like changing screen brightness or typing notes in another app) causes it to start over on the entire day.  2) videos don‚Äôt have sound, so I have to copy the link and play elsewhere  3) passcode lock page has ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù link that blocks the 0 button  4) need iPad compatibility because it‚Äôs easier to read on a larger screen  5) allow split screen in iPad so I can take notes in a separate app on the same screen.   Good things  A) great content from a variety of sources  B) good daily self-ranking system  C) passcode lock is nice"

"11320",1068366903,"I love the Emily Wants To Play Series, and so far I‚Äôve bought all of them!  There is a problem with the controls pad, involving quick glitches of movement when carefully dragged. I also think that Emily Wants To Play Too is a bit smoother.  The bright side is that the game is amazing and very scary. The environment is horrifying, and the game is replayable and fun every time!"
"11321",1068366903,"I‚Äôve never paid for mobile game but I had to get this one, there‚Äôs not another game out there like it, so I played the all the dolls games but when it comes to miss Emily the controls start Buffon out. Can‚Äôt open doors the directional keys on the left of the screen moves up from where it traditionally is and somehow when I try and open doors to find the little brat I get turned around somehow and every second of those 75 are precious. Please fix this or is the operator? (I doubt it) I might have to get the Xbox version to truly experience little miss Emily and dolls.                Yours truly-gonna find that brat"
"11322",1068366903,"For some reason, it will not play the game. It will freeze and after about 10 seconds, crash. If you could help in some way, it will get 5 stars. Fix it or I want a refund."
"11323",1068366937,"You should play because it‚Äôs fun"
"11324",1068366937,"Game crashes whenever I try to load it, so I literally can‚Äôt even get into my reef anymore. FaceBook connection has been broken for months now. Takes months to hear back from customer support too. Don‚Äôt waste your time installing if you‚Äôve never played, its not worth even trying this game now."
"11325",1068366937,"It may be due to a lack of gameplay when your device is under 1.59 of ram.  Total ram spec 0.97 gb.

"11326",1068378177,"Hello Folks,  Just a small review for the best animated series Yu-Gi-Oh we all are playing around a year and more. Just for the best into gameplay how about a big update for animated characters and monsters (see how they attack opponents monsters and vice versa), or how a character uses his trap card and and.  Hope hearing that shortly.  Regards."
"11327",1068378177,"When you guy going update have Vietnam language"
"11328",1068378177,"Good gameplay. Graphics are fine. The pvp duels are rigged to make sure you lose sometimes though. You can have the most well balanced deck and get dealt all spell or trap cards. One time is bad luck but four matches in a row? You get put into positions where you have no moves so you either surrender or just sit and take the beating. Which means grinding out and eating losses to move up anywhere. Make it actually random and not geared to get people to spend more money and buy cards and you‚Äôll have a bigger fan base."
"11329",1068416637,"Great puzzle that is fun to play...with beautiful graphics and relaxing background music......challenging puzzle without being difficult just to be difficult...you have to just use your brain... I thoroughly enjoyed Zenge, good job!!!"
"11330",1068416637,"It was a pleasure to play."
"11331",1068416637,"I love all the games you‚Äôve produced.  I want more levels of Zenge and klocki and push and scalak desperately (and I‚Äôm still working through the others). Every level is clever and keeps you thinking and I‚Äôve never felt like giving up."
"11332",1068512694,"I really want my money back. This game is so bad."
"11333",1068512694,"I used to love this game and I played it everyday however recently I can‚Äôt play one game without it crashing! Please fix it and I will give a five-star review!"
"11334",1068512694,"The AI in the last round in superstar cup is WAY high I can‚Äôt get the cup of four arms please lower the AI on the final because it‚Äôs WAY high so high for me to even get three goals"
"11335",1068556466,"OMG I got jipped of $0.99!!!! Horrible horrible horrible app. I‚Äôm kicking myself in the head for not trusting the recent negative reviews. NO CONTENT!!!! Do NOT download!"
"11336",1068556466,"Been looking for a great atlas app with world maps and a search feature since the disappearance of the National Geographic Atlas. Tried quite a few, and this is by far the best! Great job! I found it really interesting that the App Store is flooded with geography quiz apps. They‚Äôre almost a dime a dozen now."
"11337",1068556466,"Purchased this app for my backpacking trip in Europe, and based on the reviews I had high expectations. Sadly, the app never seems to work right and is constantly loading and will eventually error out saying it can't connect to the server, both on WiFi and cellular data. Don't waste your $0.99, instead just download Wikivoyage offline pages."
"11338",1068596150,"Good slots"
"11339",1068596150,"Love the graphics but haven't been able to enjoy a full game. It keeps closing and I have to reopen the game"
"11340",1068596150,"Why are you taking my credits?  When I closed the app I had over 66,000,000.  When I opened it later, I had only 60,000,000. No, I am not mistaken because I keep track of my credits.  STOP STEALING MY CREDITS!!!!"
"11341",1068766238,"Nice."

"11343",1068766238,"Downloaded and generated all within the same minute! WOW!"
"11344",1068808996,"Just update the game"
"11345",1068808996,"This game is a definite install for those who love cars, it‚Äôs really fun, simple, and offers a wide variety of cars and even more customization options. Cars are implemented into the game, but on a weird schedule. Which is perfectly fine, considering they add 4-5 cars at a time with beautiful and precise detail. All in all, definitely worth a try.  (Although I do wish they‚Äôd add a 2003 Ford Sporttrac)"
"11346",1068808996,"Love the game but I think it could use dirt tracks off-road tires sand tires lift kits for trucks and monster trucks"
"11347",1069160488,"very entertaining"
"11348",1069160488,"Fun"
"11349",1069160488,"For the past two days I have not been able to watch a video to double the amount of coins from the time I was gone. I can watch videos within the app but it‚Äôs not allowing you to watch any videos when it comes down to double the amount. I have restarted my phone my notepad and both are not working properly"
"11350",1069162618,"The concept is pretty cool and fun, but it really isn't enough in itself to be worth it in my opinion. Would be so much nicer if there was a mode where you could use your coins/score to upgrade your weapons/skills/characters/etc. and some kind of unlocks would make it so much better..."
"11351",1069162618,"Fun twist on Match 3. The playfield is a dungeon map and you can move your character around collecting keys and fighting monsters. But this feels like a prototype. No character progression, only one character, no weapons and very few skills. Doesn't even have rewards for making matches! Each game is a high score run, and once mastered, is pretty easy to accomplish unless you get a string of bad luck. Art is nice and core concept is awesome but needs so much more to make a worthwhile purchase. Swap Sword 2 please!!!"
"11352",1069162618,"I found the game kind of dull and repetitive--a combination that doesn't work. Look elsewhere for match-3 hybrids."
"11353",1069236120,"not able to get any more fusion matter"
"11354",1069236120,"This game is my favorite because it‚Äôs such a great game to pass the time, or when you need to do something with your handsüòÅüëçplus the graphics are absolutely adorable!"

"11359",1069359097,"From something so simple. One complaint though. Why does the big light gray disk appear when you touch close to one end of a string 1) preventing playing closer to the end of the string and 2) It‚Äôs wasting time, and is frustrating, to have to keep putting the string end back to where it was. I‚Äôve already gotten my monies worth with the sounds I‚Äôve milked out of the app. Good idea nicely done! Needs to support landscape mode. In the YouTube video, where are those other screens with verbiage and dynamic graphics? Needs to save your drawings. Should also play in the background."
"11360",1069359097,"Audio Copy capability is a great addition to this already wonderful app. Looks beautiful. Sounds beautiful. Kudos to the devs!"
"11361",1069359097,"favorite music art app in a long time. makes me feel as though i'm in a cave painting the walls.  great!"
"11362",1069361548,"While the wallpapers are pretty interesting, it doesn‚Äôt justify spending $8 a month on them. A monthly subscription for wallpaper is just absurd, especially at the cost of a basic Hulu subscription. The free ones are also pretty entertaining but way too many ads with the tiniest exit bar just doesn‚Äôt make it worth it."
"11363",1069361548,"I never write reviews but seriously this is to save people from wasting their time downloading this app. I get it, every app developer wants you to buy the premium version but this was ridiculous. Pretty much every good live wallpaper was premium only. All the free ones were blah. And the worst thing that caused me to delete was the fact that every minute was an ad that would pop up. Complete waste."
"11364",1069361548,"Don‚Äôt download this app, it‚Äôs the worst thing ever and it‚Äôs so glitchy. I was using it and it gave me a virus and stole 200,000 dollars from me DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!"
"11365",1069508452,"Unlike some of the newer Big Fish games, this one has puzzles with clear instructions. There‚Äôs also no duplication of puzzles in the game, which is great. I also appreciate being able to zoom in on the HOPs. Even though I‚Äôm near-sighted some of these HOPs are tiny! The Hidden Object puzzles, are, however, a little wonky. More than once, I tapped the right spot repeatedly, but it wouldn‚Äôt clear the object until I hit the hint button. I also wish the game had been longer. Maybe if less time and megabytes are devoted to a few too many video cutscenes, there would be more room for additional gameplay!  This is an older game, but I intentionally sought an older game since the newer Big Fish games have been disappointing in regard to the puzzles and way too elaborate video cut scenes. Please make more games like this one!"
"11366",1069508452,"The story line is typical but the presentation and execution of the puzzles and hidden objects are fresh and imaginative. Really enjoy this game"
"11367",1069508452,"Graphics are nice and flow easily.  Games are not frustrating and make sense.  Narration does not completely take over the game, just enough to explain what's going on.  Have only made it through the first 5 scenes, but expect the rest to be just as good."
"11368",1069621692,"I have a 6s, didn't work for me."
"11369",1069621692,"It added blobs of brown and yellow color to my photo which then dissolved into my original photo. I seriously could've made this myself using power point. It looks like it uses MS paint for the colors and power point for the effect. Looks nothing like live photo. Don't waste your money, it's a ripoff."
"11370",1069621692,"Works smoothly. It's stupid simple don't so don't expect a lot of customization (pick one picture or two, then add an effect and you're done).  The deal breaker to me it that it substantially reduces the quality of the image - this flaw makes it not worth the $2."

"11379",1069735362,"It's good game in general, but it's just a game I would play just to kill time. If I'm waiting for something and it seems like it's taking forever, I will play this game. But I think it's a good game over all"
"11380",1069786966,"I mean the game is really good but I gotta admit there are way to many ads.It is not nessessary to have an ad every 10 seconds or so."

"11385",1069786972,"You already know the people who out good ratings were the makers. It‚Äôs not even a real basketball game! All you do is move the ball down the court with the defenders doing nothing to protect it, and then you shoot a 3 pointer! THATS THE WHOLE GAME!"
"11386",1069787152,"This app is amazing!!! I‚Äôve played it for 5 min and it is already my favorite game by far! Highly recommend this game"

There‚Äôs always just that one dumb ad that just won‚Äôt. Go. Away. After like 3 minutes, an X appears, but nothing happens when you press it. Most people put a ton of bad ratings on hockey games, but this is better than that. It‚Äôs still not perfect, though. Still, haters, go away. No one is perfect."

Kids games don‚Äôt have to be educational, it has to be appropriate and have no ads. Toca boca is your best one. Even adults and teens love it. One person said toca boca was inappropriate. It‚Äôs not. They‚Äôre just jokes to please the crowd. Other kids games, like dr. Panda and sago mini have no ads and are not inappropriate. One thing you should not download is YouTube kids. My concern is that fnaf is on there. If you don‚Äôt know what it is let me tell you. Five nights at Freddy‚Äôs is a horror game with blood, murder and violence. Get toca boca games for your kids."

"11395",1070036646,"Very cool yet simple. I don't see any ads, maybe because I spent $2 on gems once.   Anybody know what the other miner icons do?"
"11396",1070036646,"Why can't we replay levels so that we could grind for extra diamonds?"
"11397",1070036646,"Almost every level is an ad, and not just any ad, they are ones that require interaction prior to moving on.  Come on guys, have some dignity, I felt like I was on a RyanAir flight."

"11400",1070107731,"This mobile game along with so many others want to much money. On this game, It‚Äôs fine at the beginning but for whatever reason when you get to like a couple missions cleared you‚Äôll hit a big monster that has a lot of HP and extremely high attack. Basically a level spike. And it‚Äôll give incentive to give real life money for gems and whatever else the devs wanted to create for you to give them your money. In my opinion these free-to-play games should all be completely free with no micro transactions whatsoever. Or change the virtue signaling name to something like ‚Äúfree-to-pay‚Äù. Not ‚Äúfree-to-play‚Äù. Because all you doing is giving free money to level up your character faster. Basically you are paying the devs to to say ‚Äúyou win‚Äù and make you feel good. Heck, everyone please give me money and I can program you a screen to flash ‚Äúcongratulation you win‚Äù every time you give me money."

"11410",1070492711,"I find it problematic to reach goals on the temporary islands.  That part takes away some of the fun."
"11411",1070492711,"I thoroughly enjoy the simple premise that this game presents. Clearing out debris to find quest items is satisfying and not too troublesome."
"11412",1070492711,"Not much in game guidance.  Controls are a little clunky.  Fun for short time"
"11413",1070504791,"Thought this would just be a cute little game, but wow wayyyy more than I expected! I love this!!!!"

I love that it teaches me something useful, such as the art of mixed drinks and time management. I hope to play more games like this in the future."
"11423",1070716801,"Very happy to see a new addition to this fun and compelling series that taught me all of know about making cocktails without the massive expense of collecting all that alcohol. Story still interesting but it's a bit short on plot development compared to Bar Oasis 2. Also hope we can freely switch routes without losing bar development progress. I really want to experience all this game has to offer without being penalised."
"11424",1070716801,"It's a really good game. I've been following it since the first bar oasis game. The only reason why I give 4/5 stars is because well first it used to only be a dollar, but now its four dollars :T that made me a bit sad and another thing is there's ads even though I bought the game. That made me mad. But other than that it's a good game :)"
"11425",1070850573,"Very realistic analog sounding. You can learn all about wave forms and how modules effect one another, without having to buy an actual synth."
"11426",1070850573,"I‚Äôve bought quite a few iOS synths...in a short time ;) this one might require a bit more study and effort but you can do sooooo much with it. FM and analogue! A mix of the two! I‚Äôm still learning but I‚Äôve already created some great stuff by tweaking the presets and building from scratch isn‚Äôt that hard.  Thanks Kira. Please keep adding to this!"
"11427",1070850573,"It is pretty good right now, but they seem to do updates all the time. That tells me they care and that makes me care.lol Too many times have I spent my hard earned money on apps only to have them left incomplete and lacking. I‚Äôm a huge fan of eurorack/Modular and this is a great outlet for me on the road or at appointments! Thanks to the developers for keeping new and useful updates coming!!!!!"
"11428",1070999857,"Still ply this one at least an hour every day. By far one of the greatest games ever made!!!"
"11429",1070999857,"One review also mentions this but yes, the controls are very different and graphics and effort to make a game like this were also poor, but to mock the president?!

"11443",1071224055,"Response time is WAY OFF! The game is so sluggish that it makes it impossible to play! If the developers would fix this one HUGE problem, then the game would be fun! Until then, it's just a disappointing dud!"
"11444",1071224055,"It has a really slow reaction time, it's like you press the screen, but it waits to send the block, other than that, amazing game!!"
"11445",1071224055,"Horrible game!! Controls are very slow. Tutorial makes it very easy and responsive but the actual game mode, sometimes the tapping is slower than you actually tapping and sometimes it's faster. Worst game. I deleted it 3 minutes after I downloaded it."
"11446",1071310449,"It‚Äôs super fun"
"11447",1071310449,"This is a great game, but l agree with the other reviews. The diamond/ key system is ridiculous. We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay over $10 to read a recycled storyline that I can get from a real book. Id rather pay a one-time fee for the app than waste money on the diamonds/keys."
"11448",1071310449,"A Royal Romance:  PROS:  Can choose some of your dialogue.  Music coordinates with the story.  Can customize your appearance and change clothes.  It‚Äôs fun to be part of the story.  It‚Äôs a visual experience.   CONS: Every costume costs ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù which can be purchased with real money.  If you want to go deeper into the story it‚Äôs costs. (There are optional scenes you can participate in. Some of them are superfluous but some really enhance the story.)  It costs more than buying a hardcover book but you get less text. (It can be read for free but you won‚Äôt get much of a story.) Can‚Äôt turn the page back to revise your choice or reread text.  Can‚Äôt change outfits when you want to.  After the chapter is done you can‚Äôt go back to it later so even if you ‚Äúpaid‚Äù for it, it‚Äôs not yours."

"11454",1071426243,"I don‚Äôt know what happened to my original review but I‚Äôd like to say this game holds up years after I‚Äôve downloaded it. I‚Äôm a little sad that it‚Äôs kind of a finished game but it‚Äôs simplicity allows for seemingly endless replay value and I‚Äôm glad I paid for it."
"11455",1071504918,"The games not bad when it works but the controls go unresponsive around every 5 minutes can't even get past 3rd level because of it."
"11456",1071504918,"Another example of ""Graphics before Gameplay"". While the game looks nice and definitely advanced in graphics (somewhat). Gameplay is VERY clunky. You must support a series of ""Power-Stations"" with an Agent, to support you must go to the station yourself and do whatever objectives asked. That's pretty much all you do. You will eventually get more Agents, however, THEY'RE COMPLETELY USELESS unless you start playing on them. So you find yourself with sticking to one agent only and upgrading him/her only. There are numerous bugs and glitches in the game. Invisible walls in the air, untouchable enemies, and much more. Some of these bugs (usually graphical ones) can completely ruin your game (Character frozen in jump sequence, controls literally died and can't move or turn, to name a few.). It did one thing right, it brought console gaming to mobile, indeed."
"11457",1071504918,"The concept behind the game is cool, though there is plenty of room for improvement. Fighting chains of enemies seem a little choppy because the character completely stops and stands rather than flowing smoothly to attack the next enemy. The gameplay has quite a few bugs that ruin the experience. These are a handful I've run into:  1. The dashing ability seems to remain usable until the second character is unlocked.  2. Jumping from a high place results in the character getting stuck floating forward with complete loss of control instead of landing on the platform. Only getting attacked by an enemy seems to return the character back to normal. Running off the platform is the only way to avoid this.  3. Failing challenges while in mid-air causes character to float and show the fail animation  4. Attempting to restart the game while falling doesn't work at times  5. Targeting certain enemies is occasionally impossible unless you target and attack a different enemy first  6. Initial infection rate of an area is always the same as the percent you finish the area with regardless of what it initially had  7. After the tumors start showing up on the power stations, there have been a few soldier enemies that randomly appear and can't be killed  8. Buying turrets doesn't appear to make them appear unless it's during a mission  9. Enemies can be pushed through tumors while attacked  10. Unable to scroll through skill description to see the cost of each upgrade  11. Attacking a jumping enemy can cause the camera to be stuck facing up  12. Attacking near a ledge can cause character to get stuck and unresponsive instead of falling off  13. Characters that are injured can still be selected before they are healed"
"11458",1071633581,"SPOILERS...  This entire chapter is based around an army-management minigame, building up to a battle at the end.  Now here‚Äôs the big spoiler.  WINNING OR LOSING MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.  If you win, you will get cheated of your victory by your plot-armored nemesis. If you lose, you will survive due to your own plot armor. Whatever happens, your friends will be all right and your kingdom will be overrun by demons.  In fact, losing may be BETTER. You get to screw up the minigame as badly as you like, and you‚Äôll get a brainwashed friend back. In order to win, you have to kill them. If you lose, the only named NPC who dies is a gruff general who barely appears in The Lost Heir 3 anyway. The only real reason to win is bragging rights.  I assume the author responded to feedback that failing TLH1‚Äôs boss battle had far too harsh drawbacks by lowering the consequences for losing, but having an arguably NEGATIVE outcome for winning is bewildering.   END SPOILERS  I recommend just focusing on building up your character for TLH3, because that‚Äôs where the stat checks become truly brutal. Again, I recommend physical classes because, if you focused on Magic alone, getting a good ending will be much harder there."

After I get done playing it I always have to take a few minutes to get my head right again, because all the flipping around and upside down so quickly kinda tricks my head into feeling like gravity actually works that way!

"11502",1072527403,"Sooooooo like this game is awesome I watch teen nick and the game nasty goats looks good!!"

"11504",1072600030,"I have more criticism than praise for this game, but it's still a positive rating because it has a certain appealing charm to its aesthetics.   The best thing about the design is the branching and minor backtracking in the level design that makes it interesting to explore.  Levels are fun to explore for secrets but the player view is too limited to see hazards that should be visible. The level design doesn't take visibility into account. You often can't tell if dropping into a lower area is safe or if there are spikes. When you have to leap across a pit, you can't see the other side and judge distance. Pull the camera back a little so players can see more. Also maybe allow players to drag the view a limited distance from the avatar to see farther.  Constant pop ups to watch ads for game credits in mid game is annoying. Should limit ads to reasonable break points in gameplay. Also, should not allow watching ads to earn upgrades without playing the game because it cheapens the feel of earning upgrades through gameplay.   Combat is dull button mashing. Player lacks options in combat so every fight feels the same.  Getting stun locked is death and feels lame. There's nothing you can do to win if you're stunned. Player needs ability to break stun. Stun lock by spikes is especially annoying since you're stuck until you die so it's worse than instant death.   Some enemies can shoot from inside walls, which feels cheap since you can't fight back, and feels like careless design.   Gear upgrade system is boring, since every item for each equipment slot must be bought in order and each is just a slightly stronger version of the previous. It's not any different from just adding more points into a stat.   Art style and music are very nice. Animations and sound effects lack energy."
"11505",1072600030,"This feels like a mediocre kongregate game but then you get a 5 minute intro of the worst sci-fi tweets you‚Äôve ever read leading to the ‚Äútutorial‚Äù which is just playing in ten second bursts while the game pauses to reveal a new directional arrow and saying you can press that to move in that direction.  Then after that lobotomy you might play for an hour or two then find out it didn‚Äôt save anything and you need to do the whole intro again.  Also don‚Äôt bother with the challenges, as soon as an enemy spawns the game harasses you with one of its constant pop ups begging you to watch a video while you get shanked in the background.  I gladly support games with ad clicks and purchases but not when they constantly interrupt the actual game with greedy panhandling."
"11506",1072737282,"Probably the BEST and MOST ADDICTIVE GAME I EVER PLAYED! (that was a shooter game) i really recommend this app because it was very fun and extremely challanging!!!ü§©‚ò∫Ô∏èü§Ø"
"11507",1072737282,"I thought this upadate was supposed to fix scaling for new devices, but it still does nor scale with the new iPad which is super annoying."
"11508",1072737282,"I never write reviews on this App Store. I usually just play, enjoy, then move on. However, for this game, I need to share my experience. First off I bought this game about a year ago and just never opened it because for me it was an impulsive buy. I felt so dumb in hindsight because this game is amazing. It has combat, stealth, witty writing, solid animation, solid frame rates, wonderful gameplay mechanics, and each mission feels unique and different. Missions don‚Äôt feel repetitive, they did a great job with diversity in the objectives and goals for each individual mission that pops up in the game. I never wanted to stop playing this game. In fact, as soon as I finished the main game I bought Ava‚Äôs additional missions. It was a phenomenal experience and honestly I‚Äôm jealous of you if you‚Äôre reading this and you haven‚Äôt bought it yet because you can live the experience of it from the beginning again with no expectations.  In summary, buy this game. - Yonkers, New York  Signing off"

"11512",1072881532,"Great concept and play design. But, it‚Äôs ultimately way too frustrating. I had to delete it after a couple dozen attempts. The unrelenting RNG makes it unplayable. On almost every turn there‚Äôs a 10% chance of bad luck. Eventually, all of that bad luck adds up."
"11513",1072881532,"This is a fun game don‚Äôt let the graphics fool you. And some strategy thrown in with some RNG as well."
"11514",1072881532,"Worth it!  Pick it up. Hope to see more from the team that did this game."

"11518",1073002250,"I started the app, signed up and got a blank ‚Äúpledge‚Äù screen. Then, when trying to access the workouts, all I get is the ‚Äúloading‚Äù spinner.  Also, when an app has not been updated in a year, it‚Äôs not being cared for."
"11519",1073002250,"I cannot log in. Re create a account, it says I have one. I‚Äôve tried Facebook too. Nothing. Bummed out."
"11520",1073002250,"This app has the potential to be the best fitness and healthy living app I have ever used. I would buy this app either separately or in a bundle with the book and I think a lot of others would too!   Please expand the recipes section. Heck I would even be ok with in-app purchases to buy more recipes similar to how the books are set up!  The eBook is very cumbersome to find the recipes and keep flipping back and forth between pages for the substitutions- an option could be to customize a recipe in-app to ensure the portions are correct for the food you like and have access to.   The workout tracker is nice, but it would be great if there were videos or descriptions of each exercise within that section instead of the ‚Äúsamples‚Äù section.   The journal could be added to the app too! The eBook version is very difficult to add text/etc on a mobile device.   It would also be a nice function to link the app to instagram so we can post directly from it to join in and track the challenges and expand our fitgirl sisterhood.   Again, I love the current layout of the app and it could be do much more with a few additions!"
"11521",1073059261,"Fun relaxing game"
"11522",1073059261,"This app awful! Do not get it. I'll make a perfect square, but it won't let me move to the next level. Even if it did work, it's a very boring game, all you do is make squares. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!"

Cannot use boosts or tickets to buy more emerald points which make it impossible to earn any emerald points. Even after each game,watching video ads will not reward emerald points. I climbed the leader board and at the end of the game, I was even unable to remain on the royal level due to the fact that it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to earn ANY emerald points. I have refused to buy anything cuz I‚Äôm just throwing my money away. Everyone else I‚Äôm playing has already earned 500 while I still remain at zero points earned. Tired of the same old lame answers from Zynga. I used to play this game to relax but it‚Äôs causing more stress. Game won‚Äôt let me ask for help from friends nor am I able to see their help requests. All ratings I have read are basically how disappointing the game is by other players.

"11544",1073473120,"This is what I‚Äôve been looking for!  It‚Äôs very relaxing and not overbearing.  One thing I wonder about is not being able to use it on a Bluetooth device.  Am I doing something wrong or won‚Äôt it work foe Bluetooth?  Curious. Charlie T"
"11545",1073476012,"The game itself is great but your first few spins you get legendary and epic but the last ten times I‚Äôve spun the wheel  I‚Äôve gotten common and a car I already have and you should also be able to BUY Cars instead of spinning the wheel"

Sometimes the puzzles really made me think snd the cute graphics made it that much more enjoyable for me. I was disappointed when i just completed the last level . It was like when youre eating a snack , and finish it without realizing untill you reach in the bag and its empty. Hope to see more levels"
"11555",1073529893,"Lot of leisurely fun. This is my second time around.  We need Ned‚Äôs adventures"
"11556",1073529893,"This game is a gem. Cute theme and graphics, relaxing music. The puzzles make you think outside of the box, but never frustrate."
"11557",1073594113,"Gooood"

"11568",1073766982,"Fun but needs more dice"
"11569",1073806361,"I love this app, it is adorable and so cute. I love how you can get a Hello Kitty house and Hello Kitty furniture. I recommend for 7-. Even adults if they want! If you are looking for something addicting and cute, this is it."
"11570",1073806361,"I LOVE this game! It‚Äôs so cute, and it‚Äôs not hard to get Silver Spoons at all! But, getting Gold Spoons is a little more challenging, and the items that you can buy that are gold are like 500 Gold Spoons!!! üò± TOO much!! But still, overall, CUTE! üò±‚ù§Ô∏èüëåü•∞üòâ"
"11571",1073806361,"I was looking for something mind numbing and easy. I love this. I check my phone every hour now just to see new ones"
"11572",1073907652,"I love the tracing and rate capture. It has been a great help managing heart rate. It is incredibly variable as to whether it saves a reading. Very frustrating!"
"11573",1073907652,"It show the heart rate ok,  but it will only save it if the heart rate is regular and normal rate. I want to show my doctor when rate was irregular and jumped from fast to slow. It is worthless at this point."
"11574",1073907652,"What‚Äôs with all the beeping when the volume is off? Took 4 resting readings in a row and they increased from 68 to 85. Used a real monitor and got a consistent 70. If you have heart issues and/or need to check your heart in public, this is not the app for you."
"11575",1073946317,"Real neat game guys.. I like how you incorporated the trophy system from other games .. my only thing i can think of is to maybe have new fields or venues to play at when you hit new trophy highs. (I just started so that may already be the case)  Either way .. cool game guys, cheers"
"11576",1073946317,"5/5. This game is really fun and addicting. It always gets better with each update, so thank you for reading the reviews. 1) Please add a way to mute people so you don't have to see them say anything. 2) Add a button on the menu to play the offline computer players instead of always just before a match. 3) Somehow penalize people for cancelling a match when they're about to lose. It's annoying when I'm about to win and they quit the game prematurely, which causes ""connection problems"" and I don't get rewarded. 4) Please let us sell unwanted equipment cards too. Great game!!!"
"11577",1073946317,"From Thursday (Jan 26) until Saturday I was able to play normally but on Sunday the connection problems started again. It's impossible to finish any match, sometimes the match didn't even start and the ""connection lost"" message pops up...  It was a good simple game, like a chess tabletop football game, but  the connection problems make it unplayable. Also developers seem to be very greed with the constant increasing of the necessary amount of cards to make a player upgrade"
"11578",1073948898,"But It won‚Äôt let me download any more songs"
"11579",1073948898,"I went to download a song and it wouldn‚Äôt let me so I thought I didn‚Äôt have enough storage so I pretty much deleted all my apps for one song that wouldn‚Äôt download and it still isn‚Äôt downloading"
"11580",1073948898,"My phone says there was an update 4 days ago and i can no longer download music.   Please fix this!!!"
"11581",1073959479,"Can not remove ads and there are quite a lot."
"11582",1073959479,"Purchased the Katamari content from the in-game shop and got charged but didn‚Äôt receive the content, and there‚Äôs no convenient or visible way for me to contact someone about the purchase. I just lose."
"11583",1073959479,"Soooo many ads, and heaven forbid you start watching some, as it then assumes you want to watch ads even when you select the home button to go back to the main screen, and sometimes as an extra special bonus it plays two ads in a row, that‚Äôs a minute of watching ads just to be able to use your second life.  Games like this have turned into adware, they should make app blockers for garbage like this."
"11584",1073992168,"I played this game years ago on an old device and had a blast and it was feasible and more realistic as far as the competition and being competitive I passed all classes and championships and have 3 garages full of cars and couldn‚Äôt ask for a better game so present day I downloaded the same game on my current device and it‚Äôs extremely hard to compete and even though you fully upgraded cars and tune them you just can‚Äôt seem to win past the pro street and it‚Äôs just no fun when you play to ungraded and spend a lot of time tuning cars and can‚Äôt win any longer so I hunted down my old phone and charged it up to play it on my old device and all is great then I started entering back in the points races and even though my cars are still tuned by the creators of the game they want even stay on the track or want run to a full pass without bouncing off the track or blowing the engine not sure what they done but they have completely ruined this amazing game and app hopefully they get things fixed and make this the great game it use to be as I‚Äôve still not seen any others to compare to it if not then oh well I‚Äôll find something else that cares more about its bugs apps and ratings"
"11585",1073992168,"Iv played this game for a year and spent like 400 dollars on this game and I got a new phone and lost everything I need help there is no customer service"
"11586",1073992168,"How is it that all street cars are limited to 15 psi when leroy cleetus mcfarlands twin turbo v8 puts out 20 plus psi up to 30 psi the horsepower limitations are too much but the game is still good"
"11587",1074004076,"I bought this game and when I wanted to play it again some time later, it shows that I never bought the game. So if you only want to play this game ONCE it's a decent game. Oh btw BF is no help."
"11588",1074004076,"I like this game series and this installment is great but I have one issue. I can't find any Parable pieces that make up the small side stories! Where are they? Anyone else having this issue? Please help!"
"11589",1074004076,"I have enjoyed all of the Dark Parables games. I've played them all many times. I can't wait for the next game to come out!!"
"11590",1074006236,"I usually get bored or hate games once I see all the ads or endless amounts of purchases needed to even compete, but this is more game than the rest. Fun. Love the idea. And it‚Äôs worth going back to time and time again. I‚Äôm not deleting this game ever."
"11591",1074006236,"So fun, addictive, I love this game!"
"11592",1074006236,"This game is very fun! And I know people are thinking it‚Äôs repetitive, but it‚Äôs a dungeon crawler and it‚Äôs a arcade game. It‚Äôs meant for you to play for like 30 minutes. This game is funny, silly, and addictive. And this game is the best game I picked up when I got my first phone!"
"11593",1074061701,"It was great, good story and art and pretty easy. But then it crashed.  I have an older iPad and have successfully played several dozen Bigfish games. This one went dark at what I think was about 3/4 way through, argh! I deleted and reloaded, same thing happened. I'll see about a refund but just a warning."
"11594",1074061701,"The artwork is particularly good. The game is imaginative and creative. Story is interesting"
"11595",1074061701,"I like the Big Fish games. They are fun, challenging but not too hard."
"11596",1074068315,"I really like this game!! BUT it just keeps crashing and it wont save my progress. I have had to retrain at least 3 times now! Please fix!"
"11597",1074068315,"It is fantastic game, with a lot of detail, great graphics (especially for a mobile game) and a lot of creative freedom for the player.  I only have two issues.  1:  When you first start, the UI is confusing, even with the tutorial...   2: Every time I leave the game, and join back, All my sequels disappear.  I have to click the sequel button hundreds of times to get all them back to re-appear.  Of those were fixed, or even just the sequel bug, I would bring up the stars to 4."
"11598",1074068315,"This game is a lot of fun. I‚Äôve played the other major game dev games like the ones from Kairosoft and Greenheart Games. There are some aspects of this that are great, like the size and multiple teams. It‚Äôs a completely enjoyable game to play. But...  There are a few things that the other games do better. Having access to all genres and game types from the get go is nice, but not being able to see what combinations are best makes innovation nearly impossible, and without any benefit. There‚Äôs nothing to be gained by experimenting with different combinations of type, genre, platform, age group, etc. because it doesn‚Äôt save what you‚Äôve learned so far. The two other games above have a system to learn from the games you‚Äôve made so that you can see what combinations work best and improve in the future. There‚Äôs seemingly no rhyme or reason to why games succeed or fail, and it‚Äôs impossible to figure it out. The only option is to look for guides and lists that have recommendations for good combinations and just repeat the same dozen that I know work. Innovation is integral in the game development industry, and this has none of that."
"11599",1074222293,"I like playing the game but it feels kind of pointless. Like I'm not playing toward anything or leveling up or advancing my weapon for more functionality. Yeah I can buy more potions but that stupid flomboy system isn't based on anything. I can play a game extremely well or very poorly and I'm going to get the same bonus round to get free flomboys no matter what. And the ""bosses"" are kinda pointless too. So you beat them and then what? Nothing.   There's a pretty cool foundation here but you need something to get the player interested in playing the game and trying to play well. From what I can tell I can pretty much start a level, wait for it to expire then play the bonus round for my 150-1000 flomboys over and over although with no advancement. Like I said, it all seems pointless."

"11602",1074223087,"I am on an iPhone 6s plus and my game force closes when I try to enter the arena. Game is very fun but this is frustrating"
"11603",1074223087,"This game is more unique then most tap and play games, it focuses more on getting characters too counter your enemy but, this game is very loosely translated from another language and could definitely use help on correcting the grammar. otherwise it has been fairly fun and has kept me entertained."
"11604",1074223087,"Fun casual game.  But items you buy with gems, or premium currency, don't work."
"11605",1074251093,"The UI can use some work but the little animations, sounds, and characters are so polished. I am hooked."
"11606",1074251093,"i love this game, it‚Äôs hard to keep me interested in games after a while but the cute characters kept me playing ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

"11611",1074311276,"I've been using WRIO for about three weeks.  The first major re-think of a mobile keyboard I think actually works.  Very high learning curve as you might imagine (at least for this old man trying to learn new tricks), but my accuracy is way up, I think my speed will be, and I find it hard to go back to the standard keyboard in the few apps it won't work with. The use of swipe for capitalixation, delete and restore, and to reassign keys to special charactors mean all of these tasks can be done with fewer key strokes and one-handed. Woth the effort to learn the modified layout, and highly recommended."
"11612",1074311276,"I love the larger key layout on this, but im havng trouble with the auto-correct function in that it seems to be not behaving as I would expect it to. For example, if i want to say that im ready to do something, the i's don't get capitalized and i don't always get the apostrophies to insert where they should, so i am having to go back to manually correct the multiple mistakes i make by not swiping up or holding the long press as I need to do. I have the auto-correct turned on in the settings, but it doesn't seem to do what I expect it to do. Im on an iphone 7, did I miss something or what? BTW, I love the privacy that is promised, but Im used to seeing the auto-correct options above the keyboard and being able to tap the correction from there. So, what am i missing?"

I enjoy how engaging and simple the game is. If your looking for an arcade game to fall in love with then you dont need to look further.  I have 2 suggestions for the Devs. The mechanics are simple and therefor near perfect, but- I would revisit the ""side shot"" and consider buffing it, if not get rid of it as a powerup. Secondly Ive noticed the horizontal hit box on the "" X fighter enemy"" needs a very small adjustment."

But once I got to the Tuscany level the game got unnecessarily hard to play. Getting the baby crabs was nearly impossible. Even just trying to pass the level got frustrating. Very upsetting. Playing this game with my friend was a lot of fun because we could work together to pass each level. At first I had a goal to collect ALL of the baby crabs no matter what. But that was easier said than done. Now I‚Äôm considering deleting this game. Not fun anymore, and having to watch ads before every level is a little too much. I don‚Äôt really recommend."

It portrayed sexual acts, and even in a graphic-novel style of art, this is NOT appropriate for children.

"11687",1076431520,"UNBELIEVABLY short, even at the sale price. Shame, because the game, what there was of it was great.  Buying BF games is like gambling.  Be prepared to lose your money.  Long time customers are probably familiar with their abysmal customer ""service"".  A new low for me was the latest Dark Dimensions: Homecoming.  There were problems with the game.  Big surprise, right?  What was new was that instead of their usual do nothing, deny the problem, or blame the customer, they did somethings different.  They did the right thing and updated the app....NOT.  Actually, they did fix the app.  The problem is that instead of issuing it as an update for those of us who had paid the broken app, they released the fixed version as a SEPARATE app. That way, they get rid of those pesky negative reviews so they can attract new buyers while completely screwing over the old buyers.  They gave it a shiny new release date and 1.0 version number but the old broken app is still right there in the App Store.  Also, this week, I discovered that the old buy once play forever....NOT... problem of the supposed past still exists.  I went to open a game I had bought a while ago and it will not work on iOS 8 or newer.  I never played this game.  I bought a bunch of games during the last big sale.  Can't get a refund because it's been over six months (from Apple, who have been great about giving BF refunds versus BF who not only never refunds, but makes you jump through stupid hoops with the promise of a refund, or otherwise strings you along in various ways until you give up). The multiple 1 star reviews clearly show that it is an issue with iOS but, again, they haven't fixed it AND they are continuing to sell an app they know won't work on current devices or older devices with current operating systems.  They'll probably never change but there are alternatives which other reviewers have mentioned.  Goodbye BF."

My only issue is the ability to search for that content through the app.  The ‚Äúcollections‚Äù tab makes content easier to find, but not everything always pops up when searching for something specific via the search tab.  I recently dropped the subscription through the app and added History Vault as a channel through my Prime account so I can stream through my television.  However, I find navigating Prime difficult as it is, and it remains a hassle to find content through this method as well.  It would be nice if I could still utilize the regular app to find content despite subscribing via Amazon Prime, because I actually find the Vault app easier to navigate than Prime.

"11706",1076619087,"The very first time that I saw the history channel, when we first got cable television I thought it was the absolute greatest thing ever but ever since then instead of the channel being devoted to its name and living up to its name it‚Äôs become a never ending time slot of meaningless shows and programming that has absolutely nothing to do with any type of history, not US History, not world History, not human history just nothing! It‚Äôs really sad to know what it once was and see what it has become. This App is exactly what I would expect from the history channel and now that I have it I will never watch it on TV again. It‚Äôs awesome because I can even pick and choose my favorite type of History and the period of time that I most like. This is a win win for me and if it weren‚Äôt for the rest of my family and the fact that I am living on a disability retirement I would now get rid of cable television and save some money for having to pay for both and be perfectly happy with having this as my entertainment and also at the same time a wonderful opportunity to learn things that I had missed or overlooked in history. Please never stop expanding and reaching for all of History, and all of its many faucets, and uniquenesses. I am completely satisfied. Thank you so very very much."

"11736",1077024869,"The game will not open that glitch needs fixed it‚Äôs been like that for 2 months now."
"11737",1077051430,"This is a well-designed game, it's fun and easy to progress without having to spend real life money, and it has good replayability - as is essential for a game like this. However, be warned that this game crashes after every video ad, whether it be to get free in-game currency or to continue a run after dying. I have yet to watch a video ad that actually rewarded me for sitting through the entire thing, it always just freezes the app or outright crashes it. I would still give it a go, cause the ads are optional and it is a good game."
"11738",1077051430,"This is a cute little game that me and my siblings love to play and it's free. So why not try it out?"

"11741",1077056423,"Okay, so the story is a soap opera for teens and bored adults, but the hidden object games and puzzles are fun. Most puzzles are just right for young kids aged 9... no surprise there. No challenge for older players. The graphics are lovely, though. A game like this will keep me leisurely occupied for a couple of hours each night. Near the end, I was eager to just put the finale on such a tortured plot. On the upside, this was more Perry Mason than anything. Glad not to have to deal with dark magic for a change. If I even detect that stuff in a title, cover picture, description, or a review, I move on to find something with some daylight. I would give this game 4 stars for the first half, then 3.5 stars from midway through the bonus chapter. The souvenirs were a nice touch."
"11742",1077056423,"I usually like the games in this series.  This one is so blah.  I've been trying to play it since it came out and just can't.  I continue to load new games or reload old games before coming back to this.   It has incorrect names on the HOG's. It will name an object, but the object is actually something else. (Necklace is actually a comb)  I could overlook that if the game was fun, it's not. Just boring, almost awful!"
"11743",1077142297,"I‚Äôm happy to catch all the Pok√©mon so I will not update it was fine how it was before."

"11745",1077142297,"I agree it used to feel better to play when it was catch em, but still pretty much is the same game as its original ""Catch Em"", just with the sprites altered"
"11746",1077150310,"The app looked and feels great! Lots of info and lore, stats to look at. You can message your friends, but that‚Äôs where the bug lies.

The message will still show up if you open the app but will not send a notification.   There are forum posts about this on [NA] LOL community as well as [EUW] where multiple people including myself are having this issue. Please fix-I like to keep in contact with my LOL friends"

"11749",1077483835,"First, my wife and I have played dozens of Big Fish hidden object games for years on a 3rd generation iPad.  We recently got a deal we couldn't pass up on an iPad Pro.  No, I didn't write that to brag.  I wrote that because many of the reviews are commenting about the screen load times.  Well, of course - it's a very new game with big graphics demands.  Look at the download size!  Sure you can complain, but there are hundreds of older Big Fish games for the older devices.  For those of us lucky enough to have newer devices, it's wonderful to have a game that shows what they are capable of.  There is all kinds of extra little animation bits. It's fun to just touch an object to see what will happen.  Okay, not all are relevant to the game story, but it certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere.  We are thrilled that Big Fish took the extra effort to make a game that really takes advantage of 'beefier' hardware.  If you've got it, this game is a must have."
"11750",1077483835,"Especially the Bonus game which is almost unplayable in spots.  This ruined it for me.   I have an IPad 2 if that makes a difference."
"11751",1077483835,"I am so frustrated with this game!! It has a great storyline, but it takes way too long to load into another area. Also, the sensitivity to get something is awful!! I ended up deleting the game and starting over 3 times!!! I finally gave up and I was really enjoying the storyline."
"11752",1077565500,"This game is fun, but I really miss the Halloween edition with the decorations and music"
"11753",1077565500,"Great game, love love,it. Can‚Äôt stop playing, just love it."

"11756",1077576649,"Sooooooooo confusing and hard but pretty good idea..."
"11757",1077576649,"This is a good and addicting game but on the next update give it more control options"
"11758",1077590028,"This game rocks!"
"11759",1077590028,"Game was fun until I got to Tredecillions of Dollars. Once I got to Quattuordecillion, progress started to slow down, at Quindecillion, things got super slow, progress completely stops once you get to Sexdecillion, and game becomes almost unplayable if you can‚Äôt progress. Please fix this developer. It‚Äôs no fun to sit on the game just to click on presents hoping to get enough gold for a 3x multiplier just to speed things up a little bit."
"11760",1077590028,"Hasn‚Äôt been updated in 3 years. Played for a long time but updates never came. Not worth your time."
"11761",1077611503,"Fairly enjoyable-my only question; how can you possibly fulfill/use all the character designs when you can only make less than half a page of original characters?"
"11762",1077611503,"Background music is easily the worst I've ever heard in a video game.  You will want to mute it within minutes of play.  Unlike Game Dev story, which I loved, you can't increase speed of the game.  So a lot of the game is just waiting.  I couldn't take the wait time after 15 min of play.  The game is dead to me until they let users speed it up."
"11763",1077611503,"This game is similar to other games after a while I get bored of doing the same thing over and over again maybe if they added some twist I would be more interested in trying to restore the purchase now"

"11770",1077829105,"This app is very much like quizlet and the good part is that it‚Äôs fast and quick to help you learn info. However, the questions aren‚Äôt in the AP multiple choice format. There are no true or false questions on the exam, but many of the questions in the app have this format. Adding real prep multiple choice questions from practice APUSH exams would be really helpful so students can have a basic idea of the format. Other than that, I was that the app was organized into the different periods which was helpful. Also the option of looking at info regarding your wrong answer really helped. I would recommend this app."
"11771",1077829105,"A lot of people give this app a hard time because they think it‚Äôs meant to give stimulus based questions, but it‚Äôs not. However, it is perhaps the most useful tool I had for the exam since it helped me identify what time periods I needed to brush up on #letsgetthisbread"
"11772",1077829105,"This app looks helpful yes. I was looking for help with reviewing for the AP US history exam and I found this app to help review. PLEASE DONT BUY IT. This app is a multiple choice review app and the bad part is that it asks questions that are too specific and not helpful in studying concepts and events that will be in the AP exam. It will ask a question about who passed a certain bill which is not helpful compared to a question that helps you review what the act actually is. I would NOT recommend this app. Don't waste your time and money on this app when you could be using other resources to study that are actually helpful. One last time DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I am genuinely triggered after buying this app."
"11773",1077954869,"It is a fun game where you are a enemy just like the goomba from Mario bros and got to kill the plumber"
"11774",1077954869,"This game is highly frustrating and starts to get boring because there is so much thinking. You can't even focus on having fun because there is so much thinking"

"11782",1078170269,"It is kind of a cool game but you can‚Äôt hardly stay in the lane for all the lagging and glitching on the game. If the glitchy driving was fixed it would be a lot better!"
"11783",1078170269,"Great game but the sensitivity is messed up and a free drive mode would be great. This game is a must have game. I also suggest other games by this developer. If you like car and truck games you will love this one"
"11784",1078170269,"Levels are way to hard"

"11786",1078180470,"When I play it's sooo fast I try to Touch but I can't it's to fast! And also it needs more color and more different looking people like add brown circles and rainbow circles and other colors that you didn't add and like a blue or hot pink or like bright yellow back round. Can you please try to make it more colorful and not to fast. Thank you"
"11787",1078180470,"Hi my name is Kyle and I've played this game for a while. It's plain to see this game is not a bore, after only several tries I achieved the top score. Easily becoming my new afternoon delight, I love getting a few taps in now and then before bed at night. it is fun yet pleasant. Would recommend as a gift or present. Thanks for reading my review, hope you can give it a try or two!"
"11788",1078203264,"I played a few races and was hooked. Then it started kicking me off, please help"
"11789",1078203264,"It‚Äôs a great game but it needs a lot of new characters, levels. It also has a lot of bugs  Like my race car kept becoming frozen and I the other cars keep going and I‚Äôm always loseing. So it‚Äôs a horrible game when you keep freezing."
"11790",1078203264,"Every time I want to play the game, I have to uninstall then reinstall. It wouldn‚Äôt bother me too much... but since the game is over 150 MB, it won‚Äôt let me download it without an internet connection. That means I can‚Äôt play it whenever I want. When I have played it, it has been a great time."
"11791",1078203772,"Don‚Äôt ask me to give you a review."
"11792",1078203772,"I paid 4.99 for the started pack which should also have removed the adds. It did not. Apple would not refund my money and told me to contact the developer which is impossible with the links. Do not waste your money."
"11793",1078203772,"I love this game and loved it from the start but one day I thought you guys shut it down and I was so so so so sad please don‚Äôt shut it down soon :)"

"11796",1078297893,"≈Åove the characters"
"11797",1078412469,"Apparently the developer has decided to not update this app any further. It certainly shows. MobileMouse spanks this in every conceivable way."
"11798",1078412469,"I‚Äôve been playing with this app for about a half an hour now and it seems to work well. I‚Äôve been using it to navigate my computer, play Sims 4, Tropico, and Orwell. It takes s bit getting used to, but it‚Äôs working quite nicely!"
"11799",1078412469,"I tried connecting this with my chromebook and even though it says it is compatible with chromebooks, every time it fails. I shouldn‚Äôt have wasted my money. This is bs."
"11800",1078553808,"The gameplay is ok, but the game is buggy and crashes alot.  It‚Äôs been crashing with each patch for over a year now so I guess they don‚Äôt really care.  Don‚Äôt expect much help from the customer service either."
"11801",1078553808,"I really loved this game but now I‚Äôm stuck and cannot continue my love for it. I  returned a letter to some guy dressed like Robinhood in the Royal Capitol Grandshelt and now I cannot get out. The screen turns black anytime I go to a door or exit and does not return me to the World. I have to restart but it happens all over again so I am literally stuck. So sad. I am going to delete and reboot from the apps. I‚Äôm hoping this will work."
"11802",1078553808,"I was literally uninstalled the game after that . Smh adding her is a slap in the face one of the most trash updated/character  adds ever"
"11803",1078560217,"Couldn't tell how game play was due to the add bar being at the top of the screen where your supposed to click to attach your rope. Can't see what I'm attaching to. Remover the ads during game play, there are already ads in between games. DELETED!"

"11805",1078560217,"Oooooooooooh ya"
"11806",1078560336,"It‚Äôs pretty good but it glitches"
"11807",1078560336,"This game is basic and free with a short add after every other death.  Anyway I had this glitch where I could go right through the obstacles instead of hitting them and dying. I had no way to die so I kept going and after it got to 381196m, the game finally crashed. It was going Super fast by then. It saved the high score but not the coins.   But yeah fun gameüëçüèº"
"11808",1078560336,"I Cabot discribe how much fun this game is also give us more ships"

If u like the game im sorry if this is offensive to u but this is my opinion"

"11817",1078599766,"This game is absolute crap. What the heck‚Äôs your fingers for these days. Shoutouts to Jake, Aj and Colin. I love hover boards, but this. They have taken it just a little to far"

"11819",1078643602,"Seriously? Your adds play sounds even when my phone is on vibrate and sounds are set to off. If you‚Äôre going to pull that crap you‚Äôre getting uninstalled but more importantly you should be ashamed of yourselves."

"11823",1078677054,"Nice, thoughtful. A bit frustrating to get stuck and not be able to advance to try another level. And I don't see a map to skip to a level instead of tap tap tapping one by one. But otherwise very very nice design and playability."

"11830",1078967478,"in the adds of these games they make it look like you can make the best sand castle an save the animals an in the add it makes you think it‚Äôs so fun but i say save your i cloud storage it takes a lot of data an it‚Äôs a TOTAL let down first you can only do the dress up sand castle and the shell necklace and it‚Äôs always glitching i had to restart 35 times just to get past the welcome screen an when i first got it wouldn‚Äôt even work and i can‚Äôt update it. it‚Äôs so frustrating and you can‚Äôt delete it i hate this game and i recommend to everyone who wanted or is thinking about getting it here is my advice DON‚ÄôT BUY IT and the videos take forever so never get and if you can delete it please tell me how .

"11837",1079178967,"I love playing this game, I also like that you can have your own custom gem, I just have one thing to ask. In a later update, could you like put fusion into the game. I just think it would be so cool to see your character fuse with one ‚òùÔ∏è of the crystal gems üíé or even with Steven."
"11838",1079178967,"//Firstly, I want to say I highly recommend this game.  The thing I like most about this is that you don‚Äôt need to spend money to access all the songs you just need skill. Secondly, the difficulty curve on the songs are not that insane, did I perfectly beat any of the later songs, no, But I did manage to get three stars on every level within two nights. And to be honest I beat it this quick because I loved the game and was completely into the music. Wanting to help Steven and the Gems was another driving factor. (Anyone named Steven who creates a band named Steven and the Gems, I get 25% profit) But yeah this is one of the most fun, honestly free games I have found on the App Store."
"11839",1079253434,"I played for free episode 1 it was great so I decided to buy the second part, the payment went trough everything was perfect but then it said that the 2 part couldn‚Äôt be installed. This game stole my money. üò†"
"11840",1079253434,"I just downloaded this game and I played the first episode and then purchased the rest of the episode and it will not download. I don't know what's going but I am not happy. If the games downloaded I would have given 4 or five stars because it is a great game."
"11841",1079253434,"I paid for all three episodes and now the content won‚Äôt download!!!!!! How do I get my money back??"
"11842",1079321578,"This game is absolutely outstanding when you think you have reached everything you can upgrade or do it the game you get to a new spot and it hits you with more fun if you get friends together and play irl or in game it makes it even better I hope that they implement clans soon like they say they are if they keep this up this will be a masterpiece of a game I never take time out of my day to write a review for a game unless I think it deserves one please try this game out my name is PxixmxpDaddy add me!"
"11843",1079321578,"The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the you can‚Äôt free run. You have to click a spot on the ground and your character runs there, then stops until you click another spot. Not a horrible issue, but when you have a torch and trying to burn down an enemies boat while they try and attack you it gets kinda tough."
"11844",1079321578,"Where is clan and where is update?"
"11845",1079464948,"First of all, let me start by saying this is one of my favorite games EVER!!! What I‚Äôm having a problem with is I upgraded my phone and couldn‚Äôt transfer my progress. I had about 150 levels completed. Please tell me how I can get those completed levels back and not have to start all over."
"11846",1079464948,"This app. Is. So. Good. It‚Äôs calm and relaxing, makes you think, so far, ad free, and you can have endless levels with the QR code system. Best app in a while. What more could you ask for. Thank you"
"11847",1079464948,"This game is one of the best mobile games I‚Äôve played in a while you can‚Äôt find many games like it you can create you can play normal games and you don‚Äôt have to pay anything for it. I really recommend this game if you love to create stuff and if you love to solve puzzles in my opinion this game is good for anyone."
"11848",1079527526,"It is an absolute must have for any Asterix fan. I just wish it existed in french. Some improvements are needed because it crashes a lot but still... I just love it"
"11849",1079527526,"This game is very cool but it has 1 problem: it‚Äôs to hard to find food. The rest is perfect"
"11850",1079527526,"First...I have been a fan of the Asterix graphic novel series since my preadolescence and was very excited to see a new game based on the characters and concept.  Second...after downloading this two days ago I have yet to get past building my first shelter. Why? The game will NOT do anything after tapping the red arrow or anything else, actually. The arrow acts like it has been pressed, but nothing happens. Yes, I even downloaded the latest update. If you can fix this so I can play the star rating may increase...but until then..."
"11851",1079607960,"I just opened this app and the layout and photos are simply beautiful. Well done!"
"11852",1079607960,"Pretty much the website and the website is better. Really hopping this would be more."
"11853",1079607960,"The app itself is beautiful. However, I found it is very hard to read the small fonts. They are not adjustable."
"11854",1079643338,"I play A LOT of these adventure, hidden objects games.  This is the best I‚Äôve played in a long time. It‚Äôs truly challenging!  Most of these games you find objects you can use in 1-2 rooms, but this one really makes you look at the whole game as the big picture, and the mini-games are the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. Each one is a big puzzle you need to solve by figuring out the micro-puzzles within.   This is not a cash grab game, or one made for kids to solve. It‚Äôs complex and challenging. The graphics aren‚Äôt always great, but the story is intriguing and complex. Worth the money, especially if it‚Äôs on sale.   I just wish I had played the first Ravenhearst before this one. I feel like I might have enjoyed the story better."
"11855",1079643338,"Yep"
"11856",1079643338,"I love you"
"11857",1079673793,"Challenging too!"
"11858",1079673793,"Boring & tedious. HOs are good but puzzles are not interesting. Storyline is predictable; map necessary since clues are not all that clear. I found myself just using the map to advance. Not much thinking involved. Graphics were good. Game played well, but when zooming the game kept counting screen movement as clicks. No where near as good as some of the classics like the Drawn series."
"11859",1079673793,"Another addition to the EiPix series.  I gave the last addition a 3+ for reasons stated on that review.  However, although this was similar in many ways, it was more fine-tuned, the plot held more interest, the music was a bit more on-target for the theme, and everything just ""worked"" better.  I gave this new addition a 4+, since it still does not top a few other companies offerings.  Keep up the improvements EiPix!  Recommendation: Buy on sale and enjoy."

"11863",1079843974,"It is the perfect mobile game. It‚Äôs engaging and has a nice consistency with the level designs. You also can‚Äôt just hop on and get to the higher worlds, you have to work for it."
"11864",1079843974,"I don‚Äôt play anymore because the ‚Äúmake sure your spells don‚Äôt miss‚Äù challenge is way too hard."
"11865",1079843974,"I give this game 5/5 stars. It‚Äôs honestly amazing. Whenever I‚Äôm bored I can pull out my phone and play it. I‚Äôm still working my way to getting all the upgrades but I love how the quests keep going. And the different spells and different quests you beat to get higher and higher is amazing. It would be cool to see a survival mode to see how long you can survive or even an online mode where you play against each other and summon the enemies to attack them. Overall the game is great. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

"11868",1079852672,"Fun to play and you don‚Äôt need to spend money if you don‚Äôt want too"

"11871",1079974548,"My 4 year old son is madly in love with this app. It is great conceptually and a perfect challenge for him. However the app freezes over and over and over again. He will be mostly to his goal, and then he cannot move the pipe pieces anymore. They are stuck, frozen, and he has to restart the level. This is frustrating him and thus making all of us miserable. I had to take the app off the tablet. It was that bad. It is possible part of the issue is with the 2 options of spinning the pipes, e.g. tapping or manually spinning them. He prefers spinning to tapping (makes intuitive sense). But his pieces freeze more than if I play and use tapping to spin and adjust the pieces.   We really want to love this. I hope it can be made less glitchy so we can use it again. Thanks!"
"11872",1079977734,"As a big fan, I will pay for their games before even playing, because I KNOW they'll be worth the money! I even have the app that shows me all their games, plus there's a category for games on sale. This title was great also, except no bonus chapter. I have also learned, to my financial disadvantage, to be careful if I am buying a game that is in their 'deals' section. Sometimes it doesn't give me the option of purchasing immediately...just 'play now'. When getting one of these, you need to go into the game right away and purchase the full game. If you don't, and it's a few days before you are able to play, the game may not be on sale at that time. Then, as what happened to me 3 times, you will pay the full price. I think that if you download it while on sale, it should still be able to purchase it at sale price, even if you don't get to play it immediately."
"11873",1079977734,"So today‚Äôs deal of the day is this game in a new forum...I purchased this and I am looking at the receipt but this new version says I did not purchase!!!!! What a scam...shame on you BF!!!!!!!!!!!  Be Leary of this company it is going downhill FAST!!!!"
"11874",1079977734,"It wasn't until halfway that the game started crashing in each scene, which is frustrating.  Domain really want to delete it and start all over? I paid for it, so if that's my only choice, but I'd sure like to see a new version or a fix for it. Its a great game, but starting over, and over and over is distracting from the storyline and the fun."
"11875",1080114119,"Keeps trying to sell me some sort of expensive web subscription to use it, not just for $30, but for $30 a year. Nope."
"11876",1080114119,"Was able to cut and edit as wished but now today says login for 3 free cutouts so I guess they‚Äôve put a paywall now. Sad."
"11877",1080114119,"I‚Äôll use another app.  GREED!"
"11878",1080169657,"This a great game, with lots of cool effects and colors. But I NEED IT IN IPHONE X SIZE!!!! Gotta get that full experience!"
"11879",1080169657,"Este juego est√° entre mis preferidos. No tiene muchos niveles pero su simpleza me encanta ."
"11880",1080169657,"This game is totally the style of game I love and is going down as my favorite 2018 mobile game I have played. Would totally recommend if you are into any mobile game that takes a little time to master to have a lot of fun"
"11881",1080243808,"Congratulations! You've turned a once charming and heartwarming sim into a run-of-the-mill clicker on phones. I used to be a huge proponent of this game back on 360. Now I'm not so sure you guys deserve it. The free to play wall is ridiculously unbalanced."
"11882",1080243808,"I enjoyed this on Xbox 360 even if it was difficult, but the iOS version is too easy. All machines are available from the start, and watching ads boosts your profits, so in about an hour you will have a fully stocked, fully upgraded arcade with high customer satisfaction. Am I missing something for deeper gameplay? I am happy to see this bide dev expand to iOS but sad to see this game dumbed down."
"11883",1080243808,"I love the game. Problem is, It crashes a lot. Also when you watch an ad for a speed up the game crashes after the ad is over and try's to go back to the game, and you loss the bonus. It's a free game and fun if it would not crash so much."
"11884",1080248000,"So far so good"
"11885",1080248000,"I loveeee it definitely going to keep purchasing more clothes from here"

"11890",1080290867,"I love this game!! I got it yesterday and it turned out extremely fun!! Everyone rate this game 5 stars!!!"
"11891",1080290867,"I love Garfield and the game a lot, it‚Äôs very fun but I‚Äôm only giving it four stars because there is a glitch, every time I press on a person (usually it happens to the people in the back.) Garfield still sits he doesn‚Äôt run to to person, and then the whole time I‚Äôm trying to make Garfield come to the person it wastes all my time, so I would really love it if you could fix that problem than I will defiantly change my review and rating to five stars ‚≠êÔ∏è"

"11899",1080345135,"This game is FLIPPIN‚Äô DIFFICULT. Every time I play, I die. Every time I die, I rage. And every time I rage, I break something. THIS IS MY 17TH PHONE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"11900",1080345135,"This game is not even a game. It cheats so you can buy the actual game. Don‚Äôt waste your time! What a garbage waste of time!"
"11901",1080345135,"This app is somehow featured on the home page but hasn‚Äôt been updated for new displays. Garbage ad system of course. Do the work and update your app and maybe people would care."
"11902",1080369552,"I have enjoyed the American Civil War games before this but must say I have completely enjoyed the English version. :) Highly recommended."
"11903",1080369552,"Fun game easy to learn but still challenging."
"11904",1080369552,"Hexwar's basic battle system,  but it seems to keep improving with each game. The combat system has a lot of detail, and now you can really look under the hood and see how it all works, maximize your attacks. The flank attack rules are crucially important in this game, and the different types of cavalry mean you really need to know when to shoot and when to charge.   For those unfamiliar with the English Civil War, it took place at a point  between Middle Ages warfare and the age of Napoleon; Cavalry was still quite strong, but not dominant, either charging with the sword or riding up close, firing off pistols and retiring. Armor was being phased out due to the rise of muskets, and infantry would protect themselves with long pike formations, almost like ancient Greek phalanxes, but they also had lots of musketeers attached to blast away at anyone who came close.  At times this system can start to feel a bit generic, as it's been used for everything from World War II to ancient Rome, but this one felt enough like the period to make it work. When I played the battle of Edgehill, there were big cavalry battles on both flanks, and eventually one wing swept around and hit the Parliamentarian infantry in the rear, that felt right.  Compared to Pike and Shot from Slitherine, this one plays a lot faster and is less detailed, but they each have their advantages; Fire and Fury is way less fiddly, and you have a lot more control over your units; Pike and Shot has a lot more chaos, with units retreating like wild or charging when you don't want them to, historically accurate, but perhaps frustrating to some. Another alternative is Musket Smoke, which is also very very good, and no luck factor involved whatsoever. All in all, it's great that there are three games on 17th century warfare on iOS now!   My only request for Hexwar games at this point would be to add some command and rally rules; then again, the current morale system rewards you for retreating your weak units before they get killed. Still, it often feels like units fight to the last man a lot more than they run.  A big improvement here is that they have cut back on the ""capture control point and receive reinforcements"" mechanic, which really gave a gamey to feel some of the older Hexwar stuff, and it tended to drive the narrative a bit too much. This one is much more like the historical force match -ups, you get what's on the battlefield, and go at it, have to break the other army's line or morale to win. And another big improvement is the really big maps they have now which offer you a lot more ways to go about beating the other army. Well done.  About the only complaint I have with this is that there's no Game Center support. The AI is good enough to make you work for your wins, but I would really love to be playing this against a human opponent!"

Being honest the one star reviews are really dumb reasons (sorry for whoever wrote them) and some are just emojis. I think those people are just mad at themselves because they can‚Äôt play it right.

"11935",1080973177,"I have played the majority of kairosoft games and have loved them all. This is the first one I truly don't like. It gives you all the usually kairosoft features which are still present in this game. But the actually gameplay of the matches is flawed. The Cpu player(s) seem to move and play realistically, like they have a goal in mind. On the other hand you will often find your player running around in circles and waiting for no reason to charge up their swing. When playing doubles your players will have no idea what each other is doing and will basically stand right next to each other leaving the rest of the court open as the cpu players spread out and play realistically. Stats aren't a huge factor in this game as you will always be at a disadvantage due to the lack of ai in your own players. Only buy this game if you want to be frustrated and disheartened by losing to players with worse stats and equipment."
"11936",1080973177,"A Revolutionary Leap Forward for Kairosoft!  ...Just Kidding! Come on, we all know why we're here‚Äì Kairosoft returns with yet ANOTHER 'Nearly' Identical sequel that's just as hopelessly addictive as all the others. The players stats in this one have a bit more depth than in the previous entries. The wide variety of ""Styles"" available for your players, plus a pretty extensive list of equip-able items to unlock means you might actually need some strategy to get through the late game."
"11937",1080973177,"It's very addicting. One thing I think you should add is when you buy something, it should ask if you really want to purchase the item. More than once have I accidentally bought something I didn't mean to buy."

"11940",1080980064,"Just get it."
"11941",1081079080,"I bought this for my daughter. Decided to unlock the second part as well, but it won‚Äôt unlock. It shows I purchased it but it still won‚Äôt unlock. I have tried restoring purchases, restarting the iPad and the app, and even deleting and reinstalling. Still no luck. It was only $2 but it‚Äôs the principle. I paid money for something and did not receive the product."
"11942",1081079080,"Title is air & SEA, but you have to make an additional purchase to get the sea version. My 5 yr old played for 1 hour and asked what else it does. Nothing.

"11943",1081079080,"Beware the entry at the top that says in app purchase for sea patrol. I don‚Äôt recall seeing it when I bought this - this is only to buy the Air patrol part of the game. You have to pay more to get the sea patrol game."

"11947",1081132864,"The game is great other than the ads like right when I start going an add pops up and messes me up then it freezes and I die so know one needs to see the adds they can see them,them self.

"11948",1081132864,"This game is so frustrating and the egg falls out way to easily, to wear if it does fall over you can‚Äôt hit the gas, to proceed playing the game, it gets very nerve racking and theirs no brake so no way to slow down! I get others  may like the challenge but not a very good game if you have zero patience!"
"11949",1081132864,"This game is fun and all, but while you are in the middle of a game, an ad pops up. The first time in happens it‚Äôs not that bad but after it happens lots, it starts to get really frustrating. Also, there is only one way to earn coins."

"11956",1081431390,"I love the series, and I was really excited to use this game, but the screen on my phone cut off some of the buttons and words on the screen and also made it hard to play some of the puzzles. I have an iPhone XR so I‚Äôm not sure how to fix this. I went to settings but there was no way to adjust the screen. Other than that, a great game!"
"11957",1081431390,"Rated 4 stars because my screen is too small for the game. I can‚Äôt see everything I need to see and I cannot complete things that need to be completed because the screen isn‚Äôt big enough. I have the iPhone XR."
"11958",1081431390,"Love it on the iPad, but on the iPhone it is not so great as it doesn‚Äôt fit the scenes to the screen. So you miss items and have a hard time seeing them in certain spots.  The game is great though. I am addicted."
"11959",1081593943,"Good story, I liked the historical setting. Nice long gameplay. Unique and fun."
"11960",1081593943,"Thank you BF, for the fixing the bug in this game although there were many more things that needed fixing. üï∑.  Even though the graphics were great and HO's were good , the hint was useless most of the time as well as the map.  I was in advanced mode so these things should have worked. I hope  it was better for you!  üçÄ‚òò"
"11961",1081593943,"I enjoyed this game so much I'm going back to play it for a second time right away. Usually I wait several months before I do that. It has many varied landscapes and characters, as well as puzzles. One thing to look out for is that a few of the Hidden Object scenes need you to leave them and come back to them. You find all the objects on the list and then are left with an item that needs something from outside the scene to finish it.  The ""turn back time"" function is unique as far as my experience goes."
"11962",1081609724,"I love this game and it is considered educational with my parents"

"11964",1081609724,"Loved it before"
"11965",1081612551,"Big Fish is greedy, interruptions demanding a review are ridiculous for a PAID game"
"11966",1081612551,"Should have read the other reviews on this game freezing because it happened.üò° Shame on Big Fish for not fixing this! I'll be reading the reviews more often from now on. Which means less $ for Big Fish. And I buy tons of them....or used too."
"11967",1081612551,"Look I would really like to love this game but it keeps freezing and now I'm stuck in fear of birds!!! Fix please"
"11968",1081832850,"Eh it's a reaction thing. I prefer Zap Bear."
"11969",1081832850,"LLIKE A GLLLLOVE!!!!!"
"11970",1081832850,"Tried to remove the ads by in-game purchase, but the button doesn‚Äôt do anything."
"11971",1081847121,"This is a beautiful toy. I love the interaction of the ball and the ink. For that I give it 4 stars.  However...  The puzzles aren‚Äôt hard enough, I was able to randomly pick out a few from every pack and complete them. None of the mechanics added to later tables presented a significant challenge.  The pinball doesn‚Äôt really exist. There is no table which allows for sustained play. The ink panels are one shots. Once triggered they don‚Äôt reset. There is no score, and there are no sequences or complex interactions. In addition the paddles are not reliable. Perhaps the touch region is too small, or accidental touch rejection isn‚Äôt turned off. At any rate it isn‚Äôt very important, as there isn‚Äôt much in the game to lose as a consequence.  The toy doesn‚Äôt explore the scope of play. None of the tables ‚Äòpaint‚Äô a picture, there are no opportunities to experiment with drawing. I actually had the most fun on the title screen, using the ball to draw lines and play with the ink."
"11972",1081847121,"The idea and aesthetics are awesome. The problem is, I constantly get delayed or no response, specifically from the right flipper. This means I‚Äôm fighting the game itself and it becomes unbelievably irritating. It‚Äôs a shame; this game could‚Äôve been great. Instead it‚Äôs all looks."
"11973",1081847121,"A beautiful game marred by laggy touch controls. Sometimes the flippers will just not activate after touching the acreen."
"11974",1081957053,"There is a possibility of becoming 'stuck' due to being locked out of scenes and having to restart. Very disappointed big fish let that happen"
"11975",1081957053,"Excellent Game!!"
"11976",1081957053,"Too easy. Predictable. Big Fish - I'm outta here."

"11979",1082069304,"Don't believe the bad reviews. This app does exactly what it advertises itself to do. If you're a fan of Sheen, you will love this app."
"11980",1082150954,"I didn‚Äôt think anything was as good as naturespace, but this is pretty good!"
"11981",1082150954,"I used this app when I got to read in a busy break room and the winter scene is great at blocking out enough ambient noise for me to concentrate on my book. The only complaint I have is that the sounds don‚Äôt stop unless you force close the app. So after I take off my AirPods the sounds start playing on my phone‚Äôs speaker until I complete shut down the app. Other than that, great product!"
"11982",1082150954,"Very calming and relaxing scenes with beautiful graphics 7/5"
"11983",1082215066,"Short, easy, clever, fun!  Different than most escape games, plays more like a quick point and click adventure (no minigames).  Nice graphics, ads are not intrusive, and no glitches.  Would like to see more escape games from this dev..thank you!"

"11987",1082309664,"I paid for unlimited mods and I still have 6 mods and  lucky blocks and lucky balls mod does not met the standards for a mod (suggestion:1 get really new mods)!(2 make sure you check 2 times to make sure you properly have the standards for the mod)!(3 get at least 15 to 20 mods on pocket addition.That is all.   :)"

"11989",1082594539,"One of the better mystery games that I‚Äôve played. It was challenging with good graphics. The link to the video hints was very helpful. Really enjoyed this one!"
"11990",1082594539,"It was a lot of fun"
"11991",1082594539,"Interesting game"
"11992",1082781138,"Very entertaining, but controls could use some tweaking. Notably, when the screen senses a slight movement in your finger, such as rolling the pad of your finger across it (kind of like what you would do for a fingerprint, but to a far lesser degree), it changes the direction of the sub. This is probably too sensitive.  Also, occasionally after losing a round, the green replay (arrow) button no longer works, forcing you to kill the app and restart if you want to play again.  Follow-on edit: where are the power ups? Would add a layer to the gameplay to encourage repeat. There's a sub that gives 2x coins available as an IAP but I've easily earned enough coins to buy the other subs already so there's currently no reason for me to buy it."
"11993",1082781138,"Great idea but poor controls"
"11994",1082781138,"Difficult to move around"
"11995",1082793702,"This is one of my Favorite games on my Phone. The simplicity of this game is what makes it truly addictive. Once I start playing, I feel like I never want to stop. Must-Have for ALL iPhone Users, and I can't wait to see what Gnarcade does next. Keep up the good work!"
"11996",1082793702,"Great game. Adding levels was an amazing Idea. Also, I love the new aliens"
"11997",1082793702,"i play this game often when i have some break , very easy to play but seems hard to master well. Just nice for a short break and mind you, this is addictive as you will keep playing it"
"11998",1082836132,"Would be better if state colors and beliefs per state were accurate to real life and if the majority of states you poll in wouldn‚Äôt go to your opponent"
"11999",1082836132,"Honestly, the best you can do is make me defenseless against a candidate for president... boo, just boo. Plus, the game is hard. One move and you‚Äôre out. Why can‚Äôt there be a Easy, Normal, or hard mode? Literally, this is hard. This is BULL****"
"12000",1082836132,"This game is super fun and addicting. It‚Äôs a great educational game that teaches you the basics on how to run in an election. I would recommend to anyone 5th grade and above because it is not only fun, but also very educational!  Some suggestions on what to add: -Should be able to use more values from the opposing party -Should be able to customize your character more to reflect the way you look -Should definitely have more choices when talking about a certain topic so that there isn‚Äôt just one choice that‚Äôs correct, but multiple -Should also make it when trying to discredit opponents ideas there isn‚Äôt always one correct answer that you always pick -Should be able to have more than five running goals"
"12001",1082891966,"I downloaded those for my daughter and I And was trying to see if I like it enough to purchase the full version. We tried the nap mediation, but I‚Äôm so distracted by the poor sound quality that I can‚Äôt focus on the message. It sounds like she‚Äôs on speaker phone in the bathroom... does the sound quality improve in the ‚Äúpaid‚Äùmeditations?"
"12002",1082891966,"It‚Äôs helped a lot it‚Äôs so amazing"
"12003",1082891966,"We have been using this app for over a year with our kids. Had the free version, then upgraded to get all the meditations. It‚Äôs great for bedtime, calming, mindfulness, etc.. The kids even ask to use the meditations on their own now and will start them, curl up in bed and conk out. It‚Äôs been  really useful to teach them to be still at bedtime and follow simple directions. Best few bucks we‚Äôve spent on a kids‚Äô app!"
"12004",1082965369,"Would be a lot better if I could skip the intro video when I try to play."

"12009",1082986584,"Ok,so I put some of the packs on and they never worked on the pocket edition like everyone says it does.Minecraft on my phone is up to date in all,but the mods aren‚Äôt actually working for me."

"12011",1083057569,"i also experience the glitch with the catagory just exit out and log in it should work  when i first got this app, it was pretty awesome. you can download several people‚Äôs snapcodes in seconds. the issue is that i keep getting an error notice. at forst this only happened a few times, but now its every other time i try to download. it says something like ‚Äúthis data could not be read as its not in the correct format‚Äù. again, this comes up as a pop up and is really annoying, especially when adding fast. if that went away, this app would be 5 stars."
"12012",1083057569,"Good app"
"12013",1083107235,"I actually love this. I don‚Äôt have time for MMORPG stuff... I tried getting into some, but to be honest, I‚Äôm usually just messing around on my phone during a smoke break at work, so Just a few minutes, and, ‚Äúbam,‚Äù I‚Äôm done, so it‚Äôs nice to have a game I can pick up any time and drop any time without worrying about what‚Äôs happening to my loot or fort or whatever while I‚Äôm working or sleeping. And as a long time Evil Dead fan, I couldn‚Äôt resist downloading and trying it. It‚Äôs a fun little time waster, and I‚Äôll be honest, I felt pretty Boss when I unlocked the ‚Äúboomstick.‚Äù  You could do Worse. Trust me."

"12024",1083356839,"I‚Äôm in the high 600‚Äôs and there‚Äôs just NO WAY to pass a level. 50+ times to pass a level, is outrageous. Try Monster Busters Hexa Blast or the original Monster Busters, THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER! The creator of this one must be an absolute MORON! He put the ‚Äúwolf whistle‚Äù on there as a penalty when you lose a life. He should know better. That a slur to women everywhere and disgusting, not to mention sexist. I‚Äôm thinking LAWSUIT"
"12025",1083362092,"If you are a fan of true puzzle point-and-click adventure games (ala Monkey's Island, Full throttle, Grim Fandango, etc.) then this is the perfect game for you. The imagery is beautiful, and story line is fun. Yes, it's a little clunky and the voices aren't always the most animated, but this is a point-and-click game, not Call of Duty (which I also play- there is a time and place for it all). Many reviews are overly harsh about the speed and feel of the game, but they miss the fact that it's about the puzzles, story, and graphics. A definite must!!! I hope they make a sequel!"
"12026",1083362092,"great artwork and a fun story with amusing characters -- instant classic if you ask me! wish there were more like it, or maybe a sequel"

"12040",1083835330,"The system is a little confusing because nothing is ever explained to you. What are skill points? How do you get more life points? Skills are learned randomly. Why does a person with 15 def get 1-shot while a person with 13 def takes 1/4 the damage?   But the cardinal sin is that the game has a boring and disjointed story. It reminds me of Chinese movies that recount some popular or historical tale, and you're expected to already know what happens so they can jump around and just hit the highlights.  Just say no. I bought this while on vacation for something to play while in line or on the bus. I won't even be using it for that. $18 down the drain."
"12041",1083835330,"I will always have some bias towards Romancing Saga games because of the godly soundtrack by Kenji Ito.   Having played RS1 and RS3, the controls felt familiar; the enemies no longer rush directly towards and trap the player when they enter a map like in the first game (as often), yet the graphics, battle system, and story feel weak compared to RS3. The graphics look cleaner than the original version, and there are now animated boss sprites.   My biggest complaint would be how you control the movement of the main character and overall UI. It's unclear where you should tap when using an item/ sometimes I would press to the side and accidentally consume an item or make a wrong choice. The translations are also... kind of funky. ""Seeling skill?"" Sealing a skill? What? (Turns out I have to be careful not to tap the skill in the menu twice because that apparently DELETES it?)   Lastly, it's also irritating how you still cannot restore LP at the inn like in RS3, and you essentially have to kill off a character's LP to remove them from your party.   -- TL;DR -- Amazing music, interesting story (but a rather poor execution of it), ugly controls and UI, challenging gameplay."
"12042",1083835330,"Saga was one of my favorite series as a kid so I may be a bit biased but I think this remake is really good.    What makes Saga great is the open world and the level of challenge.  The battle system is addictive unique in a lot of ways.    Save often as you can occasionally get into situations where you can't get out of a dungeon or scenario and may not be capable of beating the boss.  Always keep a few different saves going in case you box yourself in.    The game may seem rudimentary and from a story perspective it is fairly simple but the mechanics, challenge and replay value are all really good.  Don't give up after an hour or two.  Play for at least 4-5 hours and I think you will be a fan !"
"12043",1084084901,"The game is fun but you have to turn off the music everytime you open the app and it's so annoying! And most of the ads are 30 seconds long, which isn't normal."
"12044",1084084901,"It's great! I lose a few times and just when I've had enough it goes in üòÄ"
"12045",1084084901,"Simple and clean design, no time limit, and non-invasive sound/music makes this game a great de-stresser, but it is also challenging enough to keep me playing"
"12046",1084133300,"Do not get this app, you will waste your money, it doesn't work, and when you actually get notifications it just covers up the other one and looks super weird so just don't get the stupid app."

"12052",1084153783,"I,m sorry but I can not make it to the black hole"
"12053",1084153783,"The game has good idea, but this isnt relaxing, rather frustrating ... The game is also really bad made, and the gameplay is horrible. For 3$, I'd say no..."
"12054",1084153783,"This was a pretty cool concept using black holes but you could of done so much more except for using brakes. I won't my money back worthless game. Very disappointing"
"12055",1084197093,"One of my favorite iOS synths. Being able to import third party sounds, along with the included great sounds, really sets this apart from other iOS offerings. The best part of this synth, however, is how responsiveness of the developer! Bugs are squashed very quickly with timely updates. Must buy!"
"12056",1084197093,"With a powerful arpeggiator. Thank you for AUv3!"
"12057",1084197093,"This is one of my most favorite iPad synths. When I saw Laplace get AU3 support, I was hopeful Mersenne would as well. Now that time's here and I just MIDI sequenced a quick track with it in GarageBand. The AU layout is good and scrolls smoothly to see everything. All of the effects parameters are exposed, too. I personally prefer AU to IAA or AudioBus. And I love Mersenne, so today's a great day. Thanks, IceGear!"
"12058",1084252650,"I love this game!  It stimulates my brain and expands my vocabulary."
"12059",1084252650,"This is a relaxing game. I play it often."
"12060",1084252650,"This game is just challenging enough to keep it interesting, and I have little doubt that it's a game that keeps my brain strong."
"12061",1084331400,"I use Folioscope alot to draw my series Stickman Seccion I get lots of views on those videos. So I basically love this app and I am wondering if you can make a version for website and android? I will be very happy! From- Lombbm The Gamer"

"12066",1084407935,"The control style of shooting the undead is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever seen in any other game. I LOVE THIS game for its unique shades of black, gray, and white, adding to the location(s) for the rise of the undead. The music score is also great for its grim and ominous tone through out the game. I hope the developers add more content (perhaps a expansion pack or something to add to the story and more) but for what is already present in the game, great job developers üëç"
"12067",1084565679,"This game has been fun for me to play for a long time now, but it seems not to be comparable with iOS 11 which is so sad! ;-; I know that this is a new issue that needs time to work in but I hope they get on it soon!"
"12068",1084565679,"I love the art for this game and it is frustrating but addicting at the same time. I think it is totally worth it."
"12069",1084565679,"Fun"
"12070",1084600612,"Mind bending but absolutely addictive. Just wish there were more levels or versions. I finished this and the trick or treat version."
"12071",1084600612,"Having lots of fun with this. Many new concepts. Builds slowly in complexity so that you don't feel frustrated. Highly recommended!"
"12072",1084600612,"This game is elegant and easy to learn, but fiendishly difficult."
"12073",1084644256,"I can‚Äôt even go to seconds with out the game pausing and it‚Äôs annoying because I can‚Äôt pass any of the games"

The only problem was that my iPhone 4 (what I had at the time) couldn‚Äôt delete apps, so when I downloaded this game, that fault caused so much lag I couldn‚Äôt play the game without my phone getting both very hot and very prone to crashing apps when I opened them. However, I was able to play up to the 9th-ish level before lag forced me to stop. All in all, one of the best games of this type I‚Äôve played. Just make sure your phone can handle it first."

"12088",1084930110,"Get rid of timer. Horrible. Allow level continue option so you don't have to start over.  Run ads to continue a level. Or, we can pay to remove ads.  Then you get a 5 star rating. Without these features, there's no reason to play."
"12089",1084930110,"Please allow the game to be untimed as an option, and let players go back to the last successful level when they lose the game so they don't have to start from the beginning."
"12090",1084930110,"Game could be good, but it should have a no-timer option. As it is, it's impossible to learn how the game works, and how to interpret the numbers, once you get beyond level 10 or 11. Unless that's the point, that the player really isn't supposed to advance beyond those few levels. In which case this game is really unfulfilling."

"12135",1085697317,"This app is a must have for ideas but you must purchase the pro features to experience the apps power."
"12136",1085698206,"My 6-year old son and I love playing this together. But once we finished, we couldn‚Äôt help wishing for more levels to keep going. On a side note, a couple of the ads don‚Äôt seem so kid-friendly."
"12137",1085698206,"Why do you need to watch and add to get a costume. And why is this game Idk tedious. All the creators want is money which so don‚Äôt buy the costumes just test your luck plz. And I like if you don‚Äôt stop snail bob it begs you to."
"12138",1085698206,"When i click on hints i have to see an ad, when i want to unlock clothes i have to see an ad, and sometimes i get heart instead of clothes, but i already literally have unlimited hearts because i already paid for the app! What a waste."
"12139",1085730259,"Black Santa said he was gonna give away free yezzy's to the first 100 people who score 500. Lowkey want to be one of those people üî•"
"12140",1085730259,"This is an alright game but really? Putting up ads saying that Miley will give you a shirt or Kayne yeezy's that's low. For all the people that see this on Twitter it's fake don't waste your time."
"12141",1085730259,"I'm goin for 500 or higher‚úäüèΩüî•"
"12142",1085768995,"I LOVE THIS GAME! I first watched my favorite Youtuber play it (#MARKIPLIER) and it looked really cool! So I downloaded it and it worked VERY SMOOTHLY, so I‚Äôm kind of confused as to why everyone is complaining! It‚Äôs amazing! My only complaint is there needs to be 10,000,000 more chapters!!!!!!!!"
"12143",1085768995,"I see I‚Äôm late to this game, but I absolutely LOVE it!!!!! Just finished Chapter 5 today and I‚Äôm so sad that the creators don‚Äôt have more games to offer. I hope that changes soon."
"12144",1085768995,"I only gave this game 4 stars because it is to bloody for kids! But I do love this game!But I am a kid!"
"12145",1085821901,"Simultaneously realizing that I really enjoy using this app, but the in-app messaging and purchases don‚Äôt do a whole lot, and refer to problems that are a year old. Admittedly this is my fault, but still bummed. Seemed like this could have had potential."
"12146",1085821901,"So I use this app for school and it's cool but you have to pay a dollar for the app that's fine but to unlock the rest of the features you have to spend an extra 2 dollars why not just give everything like honestly it's a note taking app and then you have to buy it for the whole organization part of it in my opinion just make the whole app just a dollar for everything"
"12147",1085821901,"Does not work with the iWatch!  Waste of time."
"12148",1085829348,"Very disappointed in this game. It just ends abruptly. Was expecting a lot more based on previous Poe games. This one was way too short with an ending that just came out of nowhere and didn't explain why the murderer committed the murders. The map is useless as it doesn't allow for automatic transport. Oh, and add to that the huge glitch in the bonus game HOP where I can't pick up the prosthetic leg. All in all this game is a big fail! I want my money back!"
"12149",1085829348,"I am stuck in a HOP in the bonus game, in the morgue. I cannot retrieve the final item. When I push Hint in the HOP, I get an arrow indicating to go back. When I go back and push Hint, it highlights the HOP area. And I just cannot get that last item even though it is huge and right in the middle of the screen. Am I missing something, or is it a glitch?"
"12150",1085829348,"The graphic violence at the beginning was completely unnecessary in a game like this, and seeing blood splatter on the woman's face every time I opened it became an annoyance. The art was good but the games weren't smooth at all and would jump at certain points to the extent I couldn't figure out what I did to solve them; I couldn't understand what some of them even wanted me to do. Many were a fail in my book. Hidden Object were mostly enjoyable and required more than just clicking on the items, and there was variety. However, a transporting map is a must, and this one didn't have it. I wouldn't play it again."
"12151",1085899628,"I'm stuck at the tug boat. It literally won't let me send the boat off.  I restarted my iPad n still stuck there. Might have to delete the game"
"12152",1085899628,"This game is so much fun. I love it so much."
"12153",1085899628,"Game is great, very addictive! However can‚Äôt get passed building a marine park. Whatever I click, the game automatic freezes and won‚Äôt let me exit out so I can visit my island. Very disappointing, will have to delete if not adjusted."
"12154",1085908608,"Phenomenal game."
"12155",1085908608,"Its very good, great job sir"
"12156",1085908608,"Beautiful story so creative and dark, twisty.  The puzzles are easy to very difficult and the hints are perfect. Executed wonderfully and delightfully creeptastic.   Loved this game.  If you wrote a book, I‚Äôd read it."
"12157",1085978097,"It‚Äôs sad to say since I use this app on a daily basis but Pythonista appears to no longer be in development the last update being in early 2018. Would very much love to see the developer ship an update as there really is no other app like it on iOS."
"12158",1085978097,"I wasted my money on this Pythonista. It has some Mickey Mouse Way to plot but cannot do pandas or matplotlib. Well guess what. For less money I bought the Pyto app which can do pandas and matplotlib just as it is in python 3."
"12159",1085978097,"It‚Äôs incredible to be able to program on the go with a phone. I am new to programming in general so this is an excellent tool for me to compile up the code that I know into a program just to refresh my thoughts. The app features nice customization options for the theme, which somehow enhances my workflow just a bit. I have everything good to say about this app."
"12160",1086101495,"Why can i not get the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Zedge on iphone? The android version is far better. I can only blame myself for making the switch."
"12161",1086101495,"Buenardoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!"
"12162",1086101495,"I used to use this app all the time. But I noticed that the pictures on would never be updated and were the same for a period of time. Now that there is new ones added recently you have to have credits how stupid can this app get"
"12163",1086126576,"It keeps bringing me to ads and the only way out of the ad is to shut it down. I then have to open it three times to get it to the puzzle. Very frustrating!"
"12164",1086126576,"I have download a package and it is just a red field or background. I like the puzzles very much. I wish you could put a zoom on the puzzles, for it would be easier to see what you are doing. Is there anything that my be done? If we can fix the issue with the red background at least then I will consider giving a five stare rate if. Thank You."
"12165",1086126576,"App constantly freezes especially for the Daily Puzzle. Haven‚Äôt seen an update in weeks. Very unstable. Shame because the app otherwise is good."
"12166",1086252028,"SECOND UPDATE: still haven't heard from ketchapp. still issues.   UPDATE: I thought making a purchase (all purchases remove ads) would help. WRONG!!! I WAS CHARGED AND I THEY DIDN'T REMOVE THE ADS!!!! THE MONEY IS GONE BUT NOT THAT. I really really like this game. only problem is I can't play on my iPad. the app crashes. I have NEVER played on my iPad. open the app, loads and crashes.  but it's so much fun on my phone. ive given this game some hours. quick enough games to be entertaining while you wait in the drive thru or something but also entertaining enough to hold your attention for a while like at an appointment.  I'm enjoying it, it's just ANNOYING that I can't play across my devices. like if it's not functional on that device, why support it?"
"12167",1086252028,"I used to play this game on my iPad and it was SUPER fun and addictive... but now I have a phone and every time I go to get on the app it immediately shuts down and closes out the app. I JUST WANT TO PLAY PEOPLE"
"12168",1086252028,"Every time i would open the app to play, it would glitch out and go to my home screen, i only got to play a few rounds, and few i could finish before the game glitching and sending me out of the app"
"12169",1086378532,"Cool game and fun to play but I purchased the option of unlocking all levels to only find out that there are not any more levels, so I would like a refund back please."
"12170",1086378532,"Not worth the time to play, it won‚Äôt let you play online"
"12171",1086378532,"Love you  ;)"
"12172",1086502786,"So I payed for it and it doesn‚Äôt let me download it waste of my money .!!!!!!"
"12173",1086502786,"There is no difference between the free and $2.99 version"
"12174",1086502786,"I did the free goosebumbs and beat all the levels and wanted more so I payed 2.99 and it doesn't seem to go any further than the free one,my advise is not to pay for it.I Am very disappointed ,I love the game so much fun,I'm going to give it 3 stars only because I want more"
"12175",1086617993,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I downloaded the lite version and then immediately purchased the full version.. I've tried many different methods to log my day such as Excel, Google docs, iOS shortcuts etc but this app takes the cake! I live that there isn't automatic backup to iCloud.  EXCEPT.. There are quite a few analytics that this application uses.. remove or give your paying customers the chance to opt out!"
"12176",1086617993,"Just need apple calendar integration to be fully complete to my usual workflow"
"12177",1086617993,"I‚Äôve tried so many time tracking apps to try to manage my time and optimize it, but it‚Äôs either project/client based or really hard to edit. This is the first one meets all my needs, fantastic!"
"12178",1086625206,"This game does agitate me, but I love it because it helps me out with my hand and eye coordination and to have better timing when doing things.I also found out if you go to the settings of ball escape and click the question mark, it will give you a tutorial where you can get free gems. Also, in the tutorial you can die and it will let you continue without using gems numerous times."
"12179",1086625206,"All in all its a cool/fun game. Tons of advertising. But I got to 100 and beat it (without having to buy anything)"
"12180",1086625206,"The game itself is fun enough I suppose. And I understand the ads for a free game generate revenue. But why would you have gamers run out of balls? You want us to play the game so we will watch the ads to bring revenue, but you didn't consider that if we run out of balls, we might just not play the game, or even delete it (as I did)."
"12181",1086644209,"Surprised it‚Äôs not in the arcades!"
"12182",1086644209,"Fun enough, but it consistently takes 30 seconds to load up to the start screen. Makes me wonder what it's doing in the meantime."
"12183",1086644209,"I like this game a lot. It's very addictive and I keep coming back to it. However, the scoring is inconsistent. Sometimes killing something gives tons of points, and other times it gives almost none. A tutorial would be nice"
"12184",1086647459,"Why doesn‚Äôt my ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù button work? I get a failed to deliver message EVERY TIME I ATTEMPT IT, AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES NOW? So typical of this game. So many bugs in this game! Why doesn‚Äôt my VIP fuel actually add to my total when I touch the accept button? Please fix these issues if you EVER want a better rating from me."
"12185",1086647459,"I love this game it needs a little update But its really good"
"12186",1086647459,"This game real good. He‚Äôs like a neighbor. Helped me with my math test, cured my hamsters std, and helped me find my sexuality all within the span of 5 seconds"
"12187",1086794447,"I love this game. I just downloaded ir and cant stop playing!! So fun"
"12188",1086794447,"Why is people is saying this give's you a bug ? I just starting playing today I've read ya comments but idk if it's true about the bugs.."
"12189",1086794447,"Yeezy yeezy yeezy dashed over jumpmanüî•"
"12190",1086795798,"Wasted 3 bucks on a game that will not even open up"
"12191",1086795798,"I start off trying to survive. I run down the highway destroying trucks and little maurauders with no accessories and I barely get any damage. As soon as I add protection to my vehicle I die right away. I'm doing less than I was without armor. And on top of that, the repair boys don't even repair! I think you need to update the ratings on the accessories or check for bugs... Not happy"
"12192",1086795798,"As fun as a barrel of monkeys."
"12193",1086799932,"Great game. I hope will be sequel?"
"12194",1086799932,"Great game. Love the puzzles, characters, awesome graphics, good dialogue. Bonus game goes along with theme of storyline always a plus. Hope to play more like this game in the future."
"12195",1086799932,"I am having problems getting back into the game! Finished first level and bonus challenge. I loved the hidden and the puzzles parts. Just need to be able to get to the next level easily."
"12196",1086859120,"When I finished what I think was the tutorial I was reset back to square one, with the first thing I did, If I am doing something wrong please tell me but still tell me what I am doing wrong"
"12197",1086859120,"Fun and great time passer"
"12198",1086859120,"That‚Äôs was awesome Lux üòÅüòâ"
"12199",1086929344,"The app is good but it takes forever to earn gems and everything costs so much. I seem to be in a group where I don‚Äôt belong. I have trouble even getting a million fans and everyone else seems to get more than a million when they dance"
"12200",1086929344,"I only rated the game 2 stars because alot has changed in the game since playing in 2017 everything costs to much diamonds just to upgrade your character you can only watch like 3 videos before says you got to use your diamonds to energy refill I understand the developers need to get paid for there app game but it all just seems so unfair that you can‚Äôt really do that much just to get diamonds yes you can click on free ones but not everything on that list is free so I think that‚Äôs misleading to app users I love the show and the the game it seems like it‚Äôs really not like it used to be the dresses used to be more detailed etc I wish you could make it more easier to earn diamonds and videos to help and making things more detailed like before would be great to it‚Äôs 2019 I hope the app gets better"
"12201",1086929344,"Game is messing up and I can‚Äôt interact with it at all. Needs an update!"
"12202",1086964574,"Really cool game"
"12203",1086964574,"This game is amazing. As a teenage girl I often find life difficult and Radish girl is a sweet haven where I can relax and be myself. This game is addictive. It has a simplistic style and twist on every radish that make me smile. Even while sitting alone in a crowded blowing alley, I feel inspired by the teenage girl climbing a radish. This company‚Äôs games are all extremely unique and fun, and although can be wacky, you can tell a lot of effort was put into them. There‚Äôs games have beautiful little details that make you smile and have brought some joy into my life. Thank you RadishGirl. Really good game so recommend."
"12204",1086964574,"This game cured my cats cancer and inspired me to pursue a career in art"
"12205",1086978383,"This game is a real piece of crap graphics bad the game itself is stupid I don‚Äôt know y y‚Äôall bother making this place they have the toys they can play with those so long story short THIS IS THE MOST STUPIDEST GAME I‚ÄôVE EVER PLAYED ITS A PIECE OF CRAP SO YEAH THIS GAME IS WORTH NOTHING"
"12206",1086978383,"You should add 4 save files,it would work out well for people who share one IPad,cause right now,they have to share a single save data amount on a single IPad or Iphone,I mean,come on,most of your other games have save files,so this one should have save files Update:Game still good,please add an adventure mode,if that‚Äôs added,I would love it,it could be when a crime spree appears around the world and you have to stop it,and even a create your own chase thing,like in the old version before this!That would be awesome,I miss playing around with that!These new features would be great"
"12207",1086978383,"üòÅüòÑüòÉ so fun existing i don‚Äôt what to stop"
"12208",1087075743,"I‚Äôve downloaded this game before and things were great; the artwork, the thinkings, everything was great except for 1 thing:  the game is missing level 8. I have a thing where (at least) everything has to be in order (like 1,2,&3) so without that level 8 I can‚Äôt go from level 7 to level 9! So I uninstalled it. I appreciate the game, but looks like I wouldn‚Äôt download it again if that pesky level 8 doesn‚Äôt get added..."
"12209",1087075743,"I‚Äôm truly in awe of how fun and satisfying this game is. This is art.  The love the creators put into this game is so obvious. Even the soundtrack is perfect, I actually enjoy taking my phone off silent to play this game, that‚Äôs really difficult to accomplish. Seriously it‚Äôs amazing, I wish I could meet the creators to thank them."
"12210",1087075743,"Wow! This is a fantastic game and I'm really surprised the first 10 levels are free. Because of their difficulty, it'll still take a little bit to go through them. I'm hesitant to spend any money on this game though because it's not optimized for newer phones, and i don't want to waste money on something that will never receive updates. Will there be a new version of snakebird in the future that's harder than primer?"
"12211",1087125014,"This game has an interesting story. You have an idea where you need to go, but are not sure why you are there. Keeps you guessing."
"12212",1087125014,"Have played quite a few games like this and don't too often provide ratings but I really enjoyed this one. Hope there are more to come!"
"12213",1087125014,"This is the second new game I've played recently from Big Fish that is substantially shorter than their typical hidden object/puzzle adventure game. Unlike the other one (Mystery Tale - In Her Eyes), however, this one at least had considerably more depth. The game showcases many worlds from a wide range of historical eras by cleverly using time travel. There are collectible relics from each era, not too many and relatively easy to find.  There is a balance of HOP and puzzles, ranging from fairly simple to moderately complex; somehow the developer managed to invent new ones, which is always fabulous! Difficulty is configurable to the user, and one can choose match-3 games rather than HOP. The map readily enabled teleportation and indicated live tasks if desired. I could not find a way to easily access the journal without having to go through the map every time, which got frustrating when I had to review puzzle hints; however, this may have been my failure to understand the controls.  I really enjoyed the technology and history in this game, as well as the little surprises built-in when you click on some of the nonessential items; for example, the statue of an archer will shoot an arrow, lava will erupt from the volcano, etc.  Again, however, I can't give this five stars when I finished the entire game and bonus chapter in less than three hours. I hope these short games are not an omen of Big Fish's strategy for future offerings. There is no way I would pay $6.99 for a game this short, and even $3.99 seems like a stretch. I'd rather buy from and support individual developers and get a more robust game."
"12214",1087276648,"Please make this in english, a lot of players like I‚Äôam want to play this but we can‚Äôt read japanese.. this seems interesting though. Hope you guys can provide english as well like Ikemen Sengoku time romance"

"12221",1087286731,"I never write reviews but I felt compelled to write one about this app. It is arguably the best game that I have ever played. It's challenging and the graphics are really good. I would recommend wearing headphones when you play because the sound is amazing. When I score 2 stars I immediately start over thinking that I can do better. So, needless to say I'm completely addicted!"
"12222",1087286731,"Addicting strategy gameplay w beautiful scenery. üëè"
"12223",1087286874,"This game has low graphics and is just bad. If you where expecting a game then this is not for you. This isn‚Äôt even that fun. The game mechanics are buggy and feel like they are just based on luck."
"12224",1087286874,"the suffer is real"
"12225",1087286874,"Hello, I enjoy this game a lot especially showing my friends my thicc sausage. If you ever get in an argument with your friend you just have to whip out you phone open the app and show them the omega thicc corn dog that took me like 7 years to get. Anyway down to the real stuff I like it when I smack sausages because slapping sausages is the most satisfying thing in the whole world, anyway please add PVP because it gets boring slapping sausages so hard against each other. That‚Äôs my review keep slapping those sausages!.!.?:&3‚Äôsismeb"
"12226",1087287522,"I think you should get rid of the spikes. Once I played, and every block was covered except for one with spikes. I would like it more if you took that off, and let us listen to our music"
"12227",1087287522,"Seriously addicting game. Absolutely love it. But what I hate is the fact that your ads seem to pop up randomly, even after I start a new round and have about 15 bounces. Or I will click them away and they pop up again immediately. Fix that and I'll change to 5 stars :s"
"12228",1087287522,"Your taste in music and sound effects are not for me. I don't want to listen to your ads, I don't care about looking at the videos after I play, but you game shuts off my music so I just listen to nothing while I play your dumb game that doesn't even work. The gameplay is messing would rather have tilt option than pressing my screen."
"12229",1087318096,"This app is a ridiculously horrible car parking game with missions that are clueless and time limit so short making you get silver meaning less money and then watching ads , just horrible for the car parking community"

"12235",1087489471,"I love this game. Ive played it for several years. Wonderful gameplay and visuals. My only complaint is that lately the game is starting to brake due to the developers basically abandoning the game. Current issues are: Game crashes randomly, game freezes and won‚Äôt close without device restart and it used to run perfectly on full settings, now it struggles on the lowest setting. All I hope is that this game gets updated again, more than just new device support."
"12236",1087489471,"This game an awesome action packed game  I like it because it helps teach you the controls really well and there where always new things to learn every minute which I loved One of my favorite parts are the heroes with there different cool abilities  This is one of my favorite games"
"12237",1087489471,"A few bugs here and there. A few new weapons, new enemies and some land scapes. Weekly missions just feels forgotten."
"12238",1087490734,"It is a scamming game"

"12241",1087685392,"Sis I"
"12242",1087685392,"Have enjoyed this app for quite a while, but now the ads(which are too frequent) are more than often over riding the silent switch on my phone and come blaring through. Being discrete playing the game at times has become too indiscrete. Considering deleting."

"12246",1087693451,"I just loaded it and it has no sound."
"12247",1087742191,"Great app but there is an error or something.  Each time game is played it it asks us to swipe to buy.  When we do that, it does say we already paid.  Just inconvenient bc it won‚Äôt give full access without double swiping each time.  Wonderful app for the kids otherwise."
"12248",1087742191,"$2.99 is a little pricey. My two year old loved it but quickly was saying ""I already did this one."" Just wish you got more than 12 levels/games for $2.99."
"12249",1087742191,"This is a wonderful program for toddlers. However, there is a mistake. One of the activities requires sorting of vegetables, fruits and berries. The watermelon should go with regular fruits, but it will not allow the watermelon with the regular fruits. It allows the watermelon to be grouped with berries. Watermelons are not berries."

"12265",1088041538,"Not their best, but playable."
"12266",1088041538,"Great game. Ali like it."
"12267",1088041538,"I didn't even finish it. I just wasn't compelled to. I think I am done with Big Fish games. They started off creepy enough to be fun and challenging enough to be worth the money spent. But things have gone downhill since and there's no end in sight. I can't bring myself to spend another penny on a HOG in this vein (and I have bought many). Oakville offers nothing new, has a ridiculous storyline, way too much back and forth, and yet again, objects being used in silly ways. Save your money and go buy a Telltale game instead."
"12268",1088056625,"I used to love Big Fish games, but now there are pop-up ads every time you pause the game.  I would be ok with ads if the game is free, but you pay $6.99 up front and then you still have to deal with ads.  I will not be buying any more BF games."
"12269",1088056625,"You won't be disappointed..more than the purchase price because of all of the extras..I am a big mystery / puzzle player..way back to The Room one..this game captivated me..never once got bored or frustrated..if you just want HOPs..not for you..if you want something to entertain and challenge your mind..then..BUY it!!"
"12270",1088056625,"My rating is closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up because (a) I liked the complex HOPs, (b) the developer went the extra mile with collectibles, and (c) I may be too critical because I personally found the game dull.    The plot never really crystallizes, and the ending to the main game is abrupt.  The bonus chapter is very brief, so it doesn't make up for the shortcomings of the storyline.  However, the graphics, cut scenes and soundtrack are well done, and there is a good blend between HOPs and minigames. Most of the HOPs involve multiple steps, and they are a strong positive for the game.  Also, the developer provided not only a set of collectibles, but souvenirs that you can gather from designated scenes after you have completed the bonus chapter.  The controls need some work. Difficulty is not configurable.  Touch sensitivity for items and movement is erratic.    On the whole, this was a game that I looked forward to finishing, so it's difficult to say that I recommend it.  If you can buy it on sale, you may find it worth your time."

"12275",1088172195,"Have to admit I was getting frustrated with this one. Felt like stabbing something with that butterknife, but that‚Äôs what I love about these games. A challenge is good"
"12276",1088172195,"Okay, in all fairness one puzzle solution was soooo obscurely not what I was expecting that I considered four stars.  But it was a fair piece of logic, and a little clever legerdemain - my eyes were looking big picture, not small.  Gorgeous to look at, fun to play - typical Goro Goodness."
"12277",1088194226,"I‚Äôm a boy i will not play as a girl I don‚Äôt care how fun it is I won‚Äôt play as a girl And if there is a switch I can‚Äôt figure out how to do it"
"12278",1088194226,"Edit: In the absence of any developer involvement, I‚Äôve seen multiple instances of racism and anti-semitism in the chats. Needs a reporting mechanism, and someone to do something about it.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend starting this game now. The developers have stopped managing it and the dedicated players are leaving.  The story mode is pretty stale to begin with, and without new events or content it isn‚Äôt fun for seasoned players anymore. Also, the server crashed for 48 hours recently.  I really enjoyed this game and community. Sad to see it go."
"12279",1088194226,"The npc monsters just attack the monster with the highest attack stat on your team giving the game no diversity in the fights other then that perfect and highly recommend but please fix this it really bugs me ok please :( :("

"12282",1088242281,"This game can cause your phone to completely freeze, needing a restart.

"12288",1088496590,"Wow! I am blown away by the quality and usefulness of this app! Unlike other clash applications, this isn't a cheap cash grab, the developer really put time into polishing this app and I find it extremely useful in planning war attacks. Recommended for any avid war attacker! :)"
"12289",1088540036,"Game was great and can‚Äôt wait to support shakedown Hawaii! But can‚Äôt bother till this can at least get iPhone X support!"
"12290",1088540036,"I love the game but can you guys update it so that the game uses the whole screen of my IPhone X. And add some more features and building that you can enter in. Also, add some-more EasterEggs. And make it that where you can buy yourself a house and make the map more bigger and open the game more so that you can do some-more stuff. Also can you make it to where you can swim in the water, and reaching a certain point you can get eaten by a shark or a big sea monster."
"12291",1088540036,"This game won‚Äôt even run when I try to play it it just boots me out of the game so I can not play and when I try to reinstall it it doesn‚Äôt even work then I tried to get a refund but it said I can not get a refund so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this game at all"

"12299",1088625279,"I really like it and could use some more but I never know whats gonna come in the next update. I play this game every day I just love it"
"12300",1088625279,"Lots of fun if you need to kill some time.  Mindless in need of brain power to play.  Needs something more.  There is zero strategy to play.  Needs a ""nuke"" bomb you can use say after collecting say 100-150 gates.  To help get out of tight spots."
"12301",1089048531,"They keep double charging when I make a purchase. I wasn‚Äôt sure the first time, but now I am. It‚Äôs my favorite game, but I may have to give it up."
"12302",1089048531,"I love this game, except when I finish the daily  3 things you need to finish to get free stuff, it‚Äôs free so I guess we shouldn‚Äôt expect anything great, but I used to get free gold or coins, now it is, 2 carrots, 2 onions, but again it‚Äôs free stuff, but I‚Äôm going back to my game, Thanks"

"12306",1089193839,"At first I read the reviews and was wondering if I should get it so I decided to try it.It's fun and I haven't seen a single add.It's easy to.

"12308",1089215088,"and lazy UX design make this feel like a re-skinned paid version of the free Fold.   A total lack of effort was put into reward screens and visual elements outside of blocks. Level selection is a bore. Lack of undo button makes this game even more repetitive."

"12333",1090292301,"An amazing game, I loved it from the very start with its relaxing gameplay and interesting hard and easy levels.

"12336",1090532562,"I'm an avid golfer, about 3 times a week so i just had to give this app a try. It does not work. My eyes were better at finding where the ball was located. I even used the app and it was not even detecting the ball as it laid right infront of my feet. I was very hopeful for this app, but if you have no idea where you ball might have rested, it's not a miracle app that will magically find it for you. Save your money, follow your ball, and use your eyes to find it. A trial version would help others give it a try to help improve it."
"12337",1090552213,"This game has been broken for a year and STILL no fix."
"12338",1090552213,"Sometimes the buttons won‚Äôt work, makes me mad as well you know. Having a good run combo is high and then I can‚Äôt shoot"

"12346",1090757314,"So what I like to do is set the app up to replay a scenario but if you look at the back side front leg while you shoot to when you inspect it‚Äôs in total complete spot and saying I hit from shoulder isn‚Äôt even close to replay a scenario. Should update to single pin also for an option."
"12347",1090757314,"This is a incredible game..I‚Äôm a bow hunter and this is fun to mess around with in that stand anyway you guys should add 5 10 15yrd pins and maybe different size bucks and maybe add does it would be cool if you could watch you animal die but any way üëåüèªüëçüèª"

"12366",1091000556,"They locked me out of the app and now my pug will die. DON‚ÄôT GET ATTACHED BECAUSE THIS WILL CERTAINLY HAPPEN TO YOU. Plus you have to pay money so you can get stuff for your pug. I need birds for a new bed but I have no energy to do tricks or walks so I can‚Äôt get a new bed. And if you lose your phone for a day your pug DIES and is too sad to watch just make it run away or something.PLEASE FIX THE GAME SO MY BELOVED PUG WON‚ÄôT DIE!!!  Please update your game because it hasn‚Äôt been updated since 2017 THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. I need more fixes to be done like helping me get my pug back.  My game glitched out and I restarted but it won‚Äôt let me get in Alice is going to die I stand with the many people that say FIX THIS GAME PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"12367",1091215595,"Everyone keeps saying well this bugs me that bugs me. It‚Äôs annoying. 1 this app is for kids, 2 it‚Äôs free, we‚Äôre you expecting perfection? If you want it to be all perfect go buy the real version."
"12368",1091215595,"When I downloaded this game as a six year old (I am now seven), I thought it was fun! I am now in second grade and I still think the same thing.I think it is also creative! I can‚Äôt believe I can make a WHOLE  DANCE PLAY FROM MY SCRENE! Thank you for making this wonderful app!"
"12369",1091215595,"I really like this game. It‚Äôs really fun. BUT,I get tired of having to use the same music over and over again,it gets stuck in my head too much. And the outfit options are horrible. Plus there are only three characters to choose from. When I was playing I saw an ad for the other toca dance, so I clicked on it. It was everything I didn‚Äôt have on this toca dance. I asked my mom if lcould get and she said yes. Then she found out that it was FOUR DOLLARS!! So she said no. Was really sad/mad. It is completely unnecessary for a stupid app to cost four dollars!!! I am not trying to be rude. Believe me,I‚Äôve always loved toca apps . But this one disappointed me A LOT. I‚Äôm sorry and I hope you take my advice and change the price on this app. ThanksüëéüôÇ"

"12375",1091366799,"I will just do a short review because of all of the excellent reviews which are what motivated me to buy this game.  Long Time Game Reviewers (you know who you are), Bless your hide!  Since Big Fish very seldom allows us a short trial before we buy, all of my bankroll is placed on good reviews.  When a new game comes out, I have to twiddle my thumbs waiting for the reviews to come out.  Of course, I am certain that they come out earlier than 3 days after the game's release, but Big Fish has some mysterious reason for not releasing them sooner.  As for the DTE, Please keep giving us such wonderful reviews!  As you said, Lynx Minx, quality reviews is beginning to have a positive effect on the quality of the games being released.  Now if Big Fish would only realize they would also sell more games if they would go back to the old policy of giving their gamers a short trial before buying.

"12385",1091598017,"I‚Äôve always been so wary to buy a game on my phone but this one is so worth it. The first few days I had it, played for hours! Trying different strategies and trying to last longer is so fun. And you don‚Äôt just see how long you can survive either - there‚Äôs a story! This game was so worth it, and I love it!"
"12386",1091598017,"I played for a couple hours and had a lot of fun. I‚Äôm playing on my IPhone X though so I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the game crashing or not working. For now the game seems to be working fairly well. The game gets a little tedious after the survivors first few days but it seems like a great game for killing time."
"12387",1091598017,"It crashes at the end of day seven"
"12388",1091620783,"That's what this game should have been called. Fruit Ninja Turtles. It's the same mechanics just with Ninja Turtles themed enemies instead of fruit. However the swiping is not as accurate and feels clumsy. Many times I've swiped only to have missed. It's not worth the money."
"12389",1091620783,"The game is ok but there is not enough levels there are only a few.This game is not worth $4 my son beat it in 30mins and is now done with it."
"12390",1091620783,"My 4 and 3 year old really love this game. 3.99 well spent I'd say"
"12391",1091640857,"Dear creators:  Thank you.  Although I stopped at some point and I don't think that I can continue this amazing journey, because of feeling real pain and suffering, but thank you.  You've created something extraordinary.  Thank you."
"12392",1091640857,"I have to say what an eye opening experience this has been. I cried the whole time basically and felt as if I lived the pain that these parents felt. And that pain I felt playing this can‚Äôt even equal the pain they went through living this. The strength y‚Äôall have is amazing and the faith you kept despite the situation. I thank y‚Äôall for this game and showing people that sometimes we can‚Äôt escape reality the way we would like to. But instead we should embrace what life has been given to us. Thank you for showing us your journey . Joel is no longer in pain and happy watching y‚Äôall from heaven."
"12393",1091640857,"This game touched my heart. I had a experience with cancer not me but my best friend..it all started when I was in pre k and she was in 2nd grade she used to give me a hug every morning then over that summer she was diagnosed with brain cancer she had treatment but on the first day of school I saw my best friend with no expression  in her face and in a wheelchair. She didn‚Äôt remember me at all I felt neglected and very depressed. During that summer she died in her sleep. I remember that first day of school I was on the bus and my friend said she died I obviously didn‚Äôt believe her because well I was in denial. When I got off that bus I went up to my teacher and whispered to her and she sadly said yes. I was crying but no one cared because they didn‚Äôt know and her brother was in my class so he got all the love and got to talk to the teacher i know I might sound selfish but it hurt because no one seemed to care that I felt bad. Over all the game was amazing full of memories."
"12394",1091684426,"This is Awsome !"
"12395",1091684426,"GREAT GAME"
"12396",1091684426,"The game need update to improvement and solve some issues please.  Thanks"
"12397",1091699305,"It is The best game of all time it is so fun and I love game shakers games."
"12398",1091699305,"The game is great but it has just few levels try to make more like in your game other gamesü§î"
"12399",1091699305,"Game is baging and stop working.üò°"
"12400",1091700242,"When I click on the G sign to look for an address with Maps the keyboard crashes"
"12401",1091700242,"I have a Android and a iPhone this is the best keyboard ever and it stays up to date with all the new emojis"
"12402",1091700242,"The worst thing on my phone not even worth a star"
"12403",1091824117,"I got 80% on the first level and it gave me one out of three stars. I am disappointed that games are like this. üëé"
"12404",1091824117,"This game is absolute fun to play with, but the in app purchase is too expensive."
"12405",1091824117,"This app charges SO MUCH MONEY for a simple ""unlimited gameplay"" feature. I tried playing it, and lost immediately because the game has poor mechanics.   Imagine a broken game that charges you $20 for unlimited gameplay. Uh, no. Uninstalled, never downloading again."
"12406",1091944550,"Glitches too slow boring crap DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP APP"
"12407",1091944550,"This is a game we‚Äôre you play but there‚Äôs something wrong that I‚Äôm ALWAYS MAD ABOUT IT.First stop the lagging I always get mad and sometimes I delete the game.Second try to put sounds because with silent it‚Äôs creepy just put like... whatever just do it"
"12408",1091944550,"what numbers are there for the code?"
"12409",1091974564,"I‚Äôm a big Final Fantasy fan.  Was looking forward to playing this game. Downloaded it then had to download extra content. Had to wait for it to download. Go in to play the game and all it does is show a loading screen and then it shuts the app down. Yes it is compatible with my phone.  This is a big disappointment and cause of this I can only give one star and that‚Äôs cause I am forced to mark a star."
"12410",1091974564,"Crash upon loading."
"12411",1091974564,"What is the point of an app that lets you download the product but not let you play? I have solid Wi-Fi, plenty of storage, and I am plugged directly into an outlet. Every time I go to open the app it brings me to the loading screen and crashes out of the app. The gameplay looks better than most other FF mobile games, so I am quite interested in how it actually plays. I guess I‚Äôll just stick to FFBE and DOO until somebody figures a way to stop the crashes. Or I will just replay my FF games on household consoles and remove the option of spending my money in SE apps."
"12412",1092109109,"I love it"
"12413",1092109109,"Hi I'm a kid and the game is very good but there are 2 things I don't like FRIST the toy room would be good if you make it like one of those things with the tubes and slides and the other thing is more then half of the activities are locked so please pleas pleeeeeeeeeeease unlock more of the activities. And I'm also only 9"
"12414",1092109109,"It won't load"
"12415",1092146718,"I appreciate the efforts the author is going to be inclusive but there isn't an ounce of subtlety in this story. There are about 5-6 different points in the game where your character monologues about underrepresented people and has to make a decision about what you plan to do about them. They're literally the same questions and answers slightly reworded with no effect on the story. Of all the Hero Project games I felt like I had the least control over the outcome in this one."
"12416",1092146718,"this book, along with the heroes rise trilogy, is absolutely wonderful to read. weaver is literally one of my favorite characters ever. can‚Äôt wait for the second book!"
"12417",1092146718,"This game takes a lot of liberties with the way your character thinks and how they look at the world. It is completely out of your control, you can have a bad relationship with other characters, try to be cutthroat and manipulative, yet can‚Äôt help but to be ‚Äòinspired‚Äô or ‚Äòuplifted‚Äô by them. I wanted to play the game as a bitter underrepresented separatist, who sympathized with the games antagonists... and they are options that suggest you can do that, but no matter what, through the narrative you are not that person. I wanted to play as someone who doesn‚Äôt like the idea of being idolized or deified, but again no matter what your character will feel like it is their duty to speak for other people. I didn‚Äôt feel like this when I played the first trilogy."

"12424",1092276838,"It is been more than a year now that i can‚Äôt play the game anymore. It stops at loading page, I try to reinstall a couple of time but nothing. So disappointed I really use to like it."
"12425",1092276838,"Isn‚Äôt there a LAN network multiplayer mode?"
"12426",1092276838,"Was an excellent app. However, it has stopped working on all of devices recently. The lack of update seems to be thre reason."
"12427",1092463062,"This game brings back SO many memories back in Middle School. I showed it to my best friend and he and I fell in love! This game is so addictive I love it! I love this game almost as much as you guys do and I will continually support it! Thank you  Pixel Grams Team for everything you do for this wonderful game!"
"12428",1092463062,"I've finished every single puzzle with three gold stars and do the daily challenges every day! This is my go to puzzle app to do in the morning along with my coffee. Thank you for making these! I do wish there were some more story puzzles to do! I can only go back and redo those puzzles so many times! üëçüèª"
"12429",1092463062,"I was desperate to get away from the pixel color by number games for so long until I found this game. It was a beautiful game that had an amazing soundtrack, puzzles that kept me on my toes, and a wonderful design. It‚Äôs a truly free game with no membership blocking most puzzles, all the main puzzles in story mode are accessible. It is remarkable what a small group can do with a dream and the tools to make it real."
"12430",1092463295,"I saw an ad for this game and it got my attention, so I downloaded it. The first thing that happens 20 seconds after I click on ""open"", it crashes. It just did this over and over again! I hope someday it'll work..."
"12431",1092463295,"I love this game! I played it a while back and it was amazing! 10/10 5 stars whatever! I love it so and I was a big Sonic fan a a really young kid so I like the Sonic update thank you for making a great game and I wish you luck"
"12432",1092463295,"I have been playing this game for years on, and spent so much money on it. Only down fall of this game is the crashes, it crashes more often then it should. Aside from that i would highly recommend for all the anime and weeb lovers haha :3"
"12433",1092650486,"No issues. Good activities."
"12434",1092650486,"Didn't take my toddler that long to get bored though... so I kinda wish I hadn't wasted 3.99 but I guess I'll always know the story now. Not bad not great."
"12435",1092650486,"Our 10 month old loves the app/book"
"12436",1092704571,"This app is awesome and easy to use"
"12437",1092704571,"Makes purchasing so much easier, always reminds me when my favorite collections are coming out!, cannot ask for a better app"
"12438",1092704571,"Good app"
"12439",1092749144,"5 stars ‚ú®"
"12440",1092749144,"Great update, love the new art and finally I was able to complete the game. It took some time but thanks to the creators. Would recommend 8/10"
"12441",1092749144,"Hopefully part 2 will be coming out soon as well"
"12442",1092850344,"Although there no eeve it‚Äôs not very good as an eevee lover eeve is 3rd on fav Pok√©mon it should be an option"

"12444",1092850344,"I was a BIG fan of Pok√©mon since I was in kindergarten!"
"12445",1092899813,"Tried several, like this one the most.  Bit frenetic, takes some getting used to, but once you do it‚Äôs fun."
"12446",1092899813,"And change the kits"
"12447",1092899813,"Gosh I used to love ads, now I hate them!  REMOVE THEM NOW OR I WILL DELETE YOUR GAME FOREVER!"
"12448",1092971411,"After playing this game only one time and getting frustrated, I just spammed my fingers on the screen and got a score of 74. I don't know if there is any way to fix this but for right now this game has some major ways around how you are actually supposed to play the game.  -Tommy"
"12449",1092971411,"Great game, except for one thing. When it gives you the boost, it drops you right back in the game and I usually end up dying because it has no warning or anything of when it's gonna stop and then I usually run into something right away. I would change it so that after the boost, there's just like 2 seconds of no obstacles before they start coming again so I can be ready"
"12450",1092971411,"They force you to wait 5 seconds and even when you can close the stupid button doesn't even work!!! Why does ketchapp need to work with that company! Please stop!"
"12451",1093108529,"The game is amazing and I love it but it always asked me would like a premium so I would like Better coding very good game though get it and color"
"12452",1093108529,"To start with, most of the pictures are unavailable to you unless you buy the premium version.  So I found a picture that was available to me and started to color.  Every couple of minutes, you were interrupted with an ad trying to get you to buy the premium version.  You can just press continue with free version and go on with your picture.  But, it started happening more and more.  Eventually, you were completely blocked from finishing your picture unless you bought the premium version.  I cannot believe they would do that!  DELETING!!!"
"12453",1093108529,"Don‚Äôt get they will charge your card over and over till you have no money"
"12454",1093131935,"This is so much better than drum pad machine or other beat making games because it is add free, has funny costumes, and you can record your music and post it for people to listen to and vote for!! Would highly recommend this game to people, so please download.  P.S. if incredibox makers read this, I recommend an alien set-thing for your next update. :)"
"12455",1093131935,"So COOL"
"12456",1093131935,"Oh my goodness! This game is awesome! It‚Äôs like for people that couldn‚Äôt afford a $300 producing app! I really wonder what you have in store in V8! It‚Äôs worth it!"
"12457",1093180069,"Very nice gameplay"
"12458",1093180069,"I enjoy all their small Civil War battle games.  Thanks for the fun battles."
"12459",1093180069,"This is my third HexWar Civil War game and it is good. Only one glitch, when I downloaded the game no icon showed up. To access it I am forced into going back through the App Store. What's up with that?"
"12460",1093190533,"Best mobile game"
"12461",1093190533,"So I downloaded this game with no hopes because I didn‚Äôt think it was good but the more sorry playing it the more I thought it was I was so wrong"
"12462",1093190533,"I love PewDiePie and his content, so after seeing his ad at the end of his video a million times, I FINALLY decided to get it, and it is very fun! I would give more stars if I could!"
"12463",1093326711,"Please optimize your app for iPhone X! Really limits the enjoyability of the game experience."
"12464",1093326711,"This game is the best game I‚Äôve played besides fornite. it is also very funny.  I would like a update, such as making your own brick or character"
"12465",1093326711,"This game is incredibly addictive and entertaining.   As a proud Trump supporter, I find the digs at both Trump and Hillary funny political satire and it just adds to the entertainment.   If you are offended by this game in any way, you are literally what‚Äôs wrong with America."
"12466",1093360165,"I‚Äôve loved this app for so long but it‚Äôs suddenly acting buggy. It signed me out and now says it‚Äôs offline and there are no mediations downloaded and to reconnect.  No matter what I do, I get that screen. :( Anybody else having same issue?"
"12467",1093360165,"I have tried many meditation apps and they all are very limited with their product and what users can access. Although this app also has many meditation options, a lot of them you have to pay for but even without doing that, I get a solid meditation. Definitely worth your time if you like meditating. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"12468",1093360165,"I had to delete the app because the loud and obnoxious branded intro ruined my focus and flow going into every meditation I tried or repeated"
"12469",1093396572,"Nope"
"12470",1093396572,"Have played it over twice. Loved every second. Balanced, fun, and lots of room to customize your crew! I‚Äôve only found a single bug in over 15 hours of playtime. 5 stars!"
"12471",1093396572,"Steam World Heist is the greatest game I ever played and the graphics are amazing. But... ü§Øü§Øü§Ø‚ùìWHO THE HECK WAS THAT WEIRD GUY RIDING THAT BONE HORSE!!!!??

"12472",1093409783,"It glitches my phone"
"12473",1093409783,"The music is the best part. Graphics are amazing too, but the game is too short. Will you ever add more levels?"
"12474",1093409783,"This is really one of my favorite games to play, it is sooo addictive in a good way. It has THE BEST MUSIC EVER and when you tap it is not choppy at all, and it is sensitive enough so u don‚Äôt have to tap twice to make it move. I have completed all the levels but the last one and it has been a fun challenge. I recommend you get this game if u are looking for a game that challenges you but is also really fun. And again I have to remind you that the music is so moving that u feel as if u are the line and are on an adventure!!!!!!"
"12475",1093430283,"Love that the dev has 2 different ways to end the games. Great job."
"12476",1093430283,"There is no logic to figuring out: 1 what the puzzles are 2: how the puzzle fits into the story."
"12477",1093430283,"Glitchy and apparently doesn't auto save. Had to close it down to get out of a glitch and lost all progress. Not very appealing or imaginative over all IMO."
"12478",1093438308,"This cute keyboard of moomin stickers used to work great but now in iOS 11.4 it won‚Äôt paste into messages.  Please fix and update the app if you can because I love these stickers!"
"12479",1093438308,"Overall, the sticker pack is filled with a lovely selection of images of your favorite moomin characters. You get to see all the iconic characters as they were portrayed in the original comics as expressive as ever. However in terms of functionality I find the app a bit lacking. Most sticker apps nowadays allow for use of the IOS ‚Äòdrag & drop‚Äô style stickers which can be arranged anywhere on your messages. This app utilizes a less customizable ‚Äòcopy & paste‚Äô method of posting, which requires sending a whole second message in order to properly display these images. If this app were to add that copy/paste functionality I think the app would be much more successful and allow for increased usability.  TL:DR- Great pictures of your favorite characters but a poor copy/paste method of posting (rather than the drag/drop) makes the app less easy to use in ‚Äòmessages‚Äô"
"12480",1093438308,"I‚Äôm installed and added the Moomijis keyboard to my phones. When I tap on one of the stickers, it says ‚Äúcopied‚Äù then I try to paste it into the text area, but it only pastes the last text/image I copied, not the Moomijis sticker. Hope it‚Äôs gets fixed to work soon."

"12484",1093488401,"Lot of times the buttons won‚Äôt even work."

"12490",1093776653,"I didn‚Äôt really see any consequences for my actions (I just saw the same actions over and over again). I‚Äôve been in so many plays and danced for so many girls.   Also, you just gave me the option to have my iteration kill themselves??? Why the heck would you so casually bring that up? How can I die of COPD but not be diagnosed with depression or something?   Finally, eating chocolate doesn‚Äôt make you ugly! Get that body-shaming bs out of here."
"12491",1093776653,"Good game, but it still doesn‚Äôt support IPhone X screens."
"12492",1093776653,"This game is wonderfully executed the only problems is that there should be more updates. It has so much more room to improve and it‚Äôs sad its developers haven‚Äôt done anything yet. The game is fun and challenging and has a great concept."
"12493",1093811993,"I love it but could u make the spa and photo booth and clinic free in the next update? I‚Äôd love that too :3"

"12496",1093824646,"This app is not fun for me no hate but... you literally have to pay for almost EVERYTHING. the app makers give you the boring stuff for free ( and their aren‚Äôt very fun either)  and make you PAY for the actual quality fun parts. that‚Äôs just RUDE it would be cheaper just too go out to walmart and buy a composition notebook and write and draw in that! and it would be more fun too! AND THAT GOES FOR ALL OF TabTALE‚ÄôS APPS!   overall... ‚Ä¢ i don‚Äôt recommend it ‚Ä¢ too expensive  ‚Ä¢ boring i don‚Äôt like this app at all....  üëéüëéüëéüëé"

"12508",1093924230,"I was a huge fan of iAnnotate3, but this new version ruined the program. It has a fatal flaw in which it unpredictably fails to save your work locally. If you are not continuously connected to the cloud, your work will disappear. There are numerous comments online about this flaw, which the software developer has failed to fix. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt know about this, and I have lost literally THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in billed time because all my work simply disappeared. No warnings, nothing. Once I discovered the flaw. I re-created it repeatedly by annotating a PDF, closing it, and all my annotations would disappear - over and over again.   I have made the switch to PDF Expert, and will never look back. Given the software developer‚Äôs failure to fix this flaw despite multiple reports online,I will also never purchase another product made by Branchfire."
"12509",1093924230,"I got this app because iAnnotate 3 was great for searching through many PDFs for text (medical student looking for a specific detail in old notes). iAnnotate 4 does not do this very well or at all.  Edit 9/10/2019:  Update came out that was supposed to fix this problem. It hasn‚Äôt helped. I have sadly moved on from this app."
"12510",1093924230,"Can‚Äôt import local files or back them up first from the previous version of iAnnotate."
"12511",1094038347,"It's a great first offering from a new developer.... lots of originality, wonderful graphics and music... I really enjoyed it. The puzzles are good, but I think the interface makes it easier than it has to be. It would be more challenging with a different kind of interface. Still, it's a good game. I encountered a big glitch while playing and thought I couldn't finish, but when I went back in to get a screenshot for the dev, it was all resolved and I was able to finish the rest with no more problems. I appreciated that there was an epilogue but it's timed and I don't like timed games.... they make me tense and I play for relaxation.... so I started it but didn't finish. Still, there's a lot of good here."
"12512",1094038347,"I enjoyed the Secret Elevator Remastered and the Timed Add-On.  They were a welcome breath of fresh air in the sea of puzzle games I have played thus far.  The puzzles required more thought and thinking ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù to complete.  If there‚Äôs one area that I was disappointed in, it would be the endings to both the original and timed games.  They were not as dynamic as I had expected and left me wanting more.  But, the overall games made-up for this slight disappointment.  I had a real sense of accomplishment when I finally completed each game.  The ‚ÄúTimed‚Äù Add-On added another element to an already challenging game.  I had to play it several times in order to successfully finish the game.  Looking forward to future endeavors.  The ‚Äúskip‚Äù feature failed to work on my iPad Air 2 running the current IOS 11 software, which became frustrating as it took me several attempts to solve the Timed‚Äù Add-On."
"12513",1094038347,"DON'T PURCHASE - BUGS ABOUND!!!  Addendum to original review: I'm now in the train section of the game. It's clearly got a bug because there's a suitcase I cannot open. I've interacted with everything possible and I can no longer progress through the game. This is supposed to be a ""remastered"" version. I suspect it was just renamed in order to get more rubes like me to purchase it. Reducing rating to 1 star from 2. If I could give it a negative rating I would.   Original review: Purchased a couple of hours ago. Controls are simplistic at best. Easy enough to follow clues. Game glitches out randomly however, and you can only look around. If it's been a while since a save point, this can be annoying."

"12526",1094429166,"This game was amazing, I totally recommend it, it has so many twists and turns, unexpected events, and a perfect storyline. I got angry, sad, happy, I felt like I was there with Adams, I was able to visualize everything that happened, I felt like I was actually talking to a real person. This game is perfect for people who like being placed in different situations, good or bad, and to the developers, you have made a game that I can tell you gave your heart and soul in every detail, thank you."

It's the best game I've possibly ever played in my life! The graphics are amazing, and the gameplay is seamless. The level of mastery required to win was so high, I spent hours perfecting my hoverboard skills. It is amazing, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Olympics suggested it as an official sport! I would become a champion if I did! In all, I can say that this game has changed the way I look at this world! Kudos to the genius behind this!"

Some apartments and a college with some dorms would be great! There should be a bakery with cakes, cupcakes, cake pops, sugar cookies, there could be some birthday ones, Christmas ones etc.     A coffee shop would be great too. With muffins, hot chocolate, etc. like Starbucks! Christmas decorations that you can put on the house. Different aged kids too. And maybe even a new house! Thanks for reading"

"12596",1096287686,"Although this may be a phone application game, that is the last thing it feels like. You play a Crisis Line listener. Alex is the main character you talk to; he‚Äôs a police detective that takes you on the case he‚Äôs currently working. I‚Äôve found myself emotionally invested in his story, as well as the actions and decisions he makes. The only problem I have with the game is that I wish there were more options for things to say back to Alex. Nonetheless, I always find myself just checking my phone waiting for his reply. It feels like you‚Äôre actually talking to this person. It will definitely leave you on the edge of your seat if you‚Äôre someone like me, interested in crime/the paranormal."

"12602",1096834193,"Why is everything Apple turning out to be buggy or otherwise worthless? I've got 3 iPhones an iPad and Apple TV. They all have the latest OS yet they crash constantly or screen freezes. No, it's not a battery health issue. I'm just sick of all the problems I have with my devices while my Android Samsung friends are problem free. iTunes is a whole other beast. It has NEVER run correctly on any computer I've ever owned. Why? Why? Why? Bye!"
"12603",1096834193,"So every time I try to use it ,it says it needs to b connected to the same WiFi which it is but never connects smh really annoying"
"12604",1096918571,"This app is good but overall there are too many cons. First of all it makes my device and my friends‚Äô devices reach high temperatures. Another reason is that it slows the entire device and I am not able to do anything else on my phone. No matter how good my WiFi is it seems as if the video quality is terrible. I am currently using the app at this very moment and my friend is hearing my voice a few seconds later after I speak, even though I have three bars of WiFi. I would expect that an app from google would be better quality but I guess not. This has made me second guess the quality of google apps/products."
"12605",1096918571,"Awesome The best video chat app  Perfect connection  Clear sound and video"
"12606",1096918571,"Google duo is the best I get to talk to my friends and family and I get to see them and it makes my life way better download Google Duo right now       #Google duoüíùüíù"
"12607",1096938298,"Actually enjoy the full game and this idle tapper version but they definitely just let it die out with no updates!"
"12608",1096938298,"I still play this game all the time for the hell of it...is there ever gonna be a leader boards even tho its dead? I think i have actually gotten further than anybody on the planet with a 7.10% bonus at the bottom"
"12609",1096938298,"Meh"
"12610",1097004394,"Great game!!!! Lots of fun!"
"12611",1097004394,"Ï§ëÎèÖÏÑ± Ìóò!!!!"
"12612",1097004394,"It's a great game! Great graphics, great background music... But it's sooooooo hard I can't even beat the 2nd level!!!"
"12613",1097025180,"It‚Äôs a fun game but they haven‚Äôt released new levels in a few years. Has the developer abandoned this game?"
"12614",1097025180,"Having fun"
"12615",1097025180,"This is a great game to play! Gives you a chance to show your creative side by creating beautiful fish worlds!"
"12616",1097114930,"Won‚Äôt even load app it‚Äôll show the Herocraft logo but, then shut me out of the app fully. The bug continues this non stop, even after a full phone restart."
"12617",1097114930,"It is a wonderful game, I just think that the efficiency in the fitness building is complete BS."
"12618",1097114930,"The game is ded"
"12619",1097172005,"I love it!!best game ever ‚ô•Ô∏è My favorite!! Awesome game!! Go from broke to Big winings very quickly!!"
"12620",1097172005,"Great game"
"12621",1097172005,"Awesomeness"
"12622",1097200146,"It's not even the game it claims to be its ugly it's a waste of space boring stupid"
"12623",1097200146,"Shiet app, if I say so."
"12624",1097200146,"WAY TOO MANY ADS!!!!"
"12625",1097469600,"This is a surprisingly addictive game.  And the more you play the more you start to figure out the best ways to use your special moves at the bottom of the screen and boost your score.  I'm enjoying it enough that I went ahead and paid for premium to support the dev."
"12626",1097469600,"First, they need to provide a way of contacting support other than Facebook.   Not everyone wants Facebook. When first installed the app takes about 124mb of storage on my iPad.   As I play it, it grows and grows.    I've had it almost reach 1 gb.     Ridiculous!     I have to uninstall and reinstall it to get back to a reasonable storage amount.   This badly needs to be fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"12627",1097469600,"You've played 3's, you've played 2048 and similar games. Beyond 14is terribly addictive, great time waster!"

"12631",1097587096,"The game is really fun and the xylophone sounds are soothing. I like the sound makes when you get a good combination and the dice disappear, and I like the dissident cord that plays when you get a block or you use a bomb."
"12632",1097587096,"Easy to pick up and really fun!"
"12633",1097587096,"I bought this game when it first came out. I am still hooked. I prefer Zen mode, which can be played at a leisurely pace. It's my go-to entertainment whenever I have a few minutes."
"12634",1097727390,"What launcher are you supposed to use? And is it IOS or Android? What is the launcher called?"
"12635",1097727390,"I‚Äôve tried to open it like 100000000 times but it closes every time so DONT BUY IT"

"12641",1097757301,"I've been having issues every since 2 months and have decided not to purchase anything else because nothing is working properly. I've contacted customer service and still have not fixed my issue. Since they don't care about correcting the game but love to take your money!"
"12642",1097757301,"Kinda cool game at first, but as you keep playing it gets boring. There should be more features"
"12643",1097766064,"Love this game, I‚Äôm level 273 but the cakes you make are a loop. After so many, they start to repeat. I was a daily addicted player, who spent a bit of money, but I‚Äôm getting tired of seeing the same cakes so I only play monthly now...ill definitely start playing more frequently if you get some new cakes in there!"
"12644",1097766064,"Well designed! Really fun and addictive!"
"12645",1097766064,"This is the best GAME EVER"
"12646",1097821445,"All my other games work perfectly no lag no nothing. Maybe a add here and there but, this game is laggy and it gives me a add like every 1 minute and at the beginning it thought me how to move I was like ‚Äúok so that‚Äôs how you move and look around‚Äù BUT when I was walking and it wouldn‚Äôt let me do it at the same time I would walk and try and look around a the same time and it NEVER work all I have to say is GET RID OF THE GAME OR FLIPPING FIX THE GLITCHES"
"12647",1097821445,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"12648",1097821445,"Well I‚Äôm not trashing or dragging this game but it‚Äôs hard to control yourself and vehicles. But I think if they upgraded to something more recent and got better graphics it would be better. Though I only had it a total of minutes that‚Äôs because it kept crashing which is really annoying. But the back story is good. The game would be way better like I said before if they made better graphics, made us have more control over ourselves, if they update it to something more modern. But other than that the back story is good. That was my review. I think you should give this game a chance!"
"12649",1097825440,"Nice game i like it üåπ"
"12650",1097825440,"It's fun and simple. Easy as that"
"12651",1097825440,"For the past month it won‚Äôt load even though I get at least 3 notifications a day from the app."
"12652",1097895359,"Can‚Äôt even play the game because the App crashes right when I open it."
"12653",1097895359,"I have played this before on a friends phone and just downloaded it. Unfortunately as soon as I open it it closes. The farthest I have gotten was into the first level, but when I touched the screen again, it closed again. I know that it is a great game so if you are reading reviews b4 getting the app I say get it bc it‚Äôs great it just appears to a have a glitch for some people. Anyway, if there is a solution I would love to here it."
"12654",1097895359,"Not compatible with iPhone xr screen"

"12656",1097998313,"I have had this game on my phone for over three months and it is still down lading and I know it's not my phone. Every time I try to delete it or stop it form downloading it does not stop."
"12657",1097998313,"Fun great game"
"12658",1098006458,"Its not a good game for kids because it‚Äôs vary hard to stear but if you change it it will not be hard for me and kids"
"12659",1098006458,"I am CullenThere‚Äôs a burglar in my house I need help assistance now it‚Äôs 911 how can I help you I need help I was in a go home he‚Äôs attacking me"
"12660",1098006458,"Overall I enjoy playing this game. However, flying and parking are too difficult. In addition, I would like to be able to do other activities like other cars in the game."
"12661",1098041500,"All that family honor stuff is obnoxious as hell and taken to an extreme. I found it too stereotypical of Asian culture to be taken to be seriously and couldn't bear to read through all of it. Beyond the ancestral piety bs, not much of a story can be found."
"12662",1098041500,"The story was extremely linear. While the choices did change your stats, and the stats affected your choices, there were no ""multiple paths"" to follow. That was a big disappointment to me.    Another big disappointment was your name... Because you can't change it. And while your family and roommates call you other names ""like Cat, or Ghost, or names you have a say in"" there is no ""input your own name""  There's only one romance as far as I could see. That might be a creative choice on your part, but I think it would have been better to at least have two, so the player can feel like there actually making a choice, rather than forcing this one character on the player. (Not only that, but I wasn't a big fan on the only romanceable character anyways)  In other words, this wasn't my favorite COG game yet. The writing was decent actually, but the lack of actual story-changing choices was a real disappointment."
"12663",1098041500,"While the premise and story are interesting, the pressures of conforming to Chinese ettiquette and manners is mentally exhausting. The focus on indirectness also comes off as insincere."
"12664",1098187391,"Please add babies to my town discovery"
"12665",1098187391,"So... this isn‚Äôt about my town but I don‚Äôt understand why you called me 27th critical!!!!!! It‚Äôs not supposed to be like that. It‚Äôs really offensive. Ok, I‚Äôm a little sensitive, but all I asked for was a proposal dinner.üò° P.S. I feel bad about your critical notes. Hey, if mine is, write me and tell me. Also, can you respond to my 1st email?

"12668",1098189387,"Fun, attention grabbing game"
"12669",1098189387,"I‚Äôve reached the 975 level and cannot get into the next level. I‚Äôm on 62 and I‚Äôm told I need to reach level 66. How do I go forward when I‚Äôm prohibited from getting into the next game. I do not like the Expeditions at all and do not want to play them. Am I at the end for this Mahjong?"
"12670",1098207701,"Should have listened to the reviews. What a disappointment.  App never finds me an opponent through game center.    Contacted app developer.  Waste of money."
"12671",1098207701,"The only reason this app hasn‚Äôt been deleted is that SushiGo is my absolute favorite card game.   I don‚Äôt understand why they had to reinvent the wheel by only showing the symbols until you click on a card. Just show us the cards themselves! Single click, all the info we need.   Has the rules surrounding wasabi changed? In my interpretation of the rules, wasabi can be moved and played on existing nigiri."
"12672",1098207701,"Multiplayer is why I purchased the game because we love the card game.  Multiplayer is so incredibly laggy it‚Äôs nearly unplayable."
"12673",1098208851,"just started playing, really fun. only complaint is it tells you purchasing a character will remove ads, I did & it didn‚Äôt. so I had to spend more money to turn off the ads (there are so many you have to in order to enjoy the game)"
"12674",1098208851,"Great game, need new characters though fun goals tying to unlock them"
"12675",1098208851,"It's a fun game but they haven't updated in almost a year!"
"12676",1098209028,"Fun! Used for a long flight made the time pass faster!"
"12677",1098209028,"It's ok but not a real colouring book until it can be used with Apple Pencil. Needs Apple Pencil support asap."
"12678",1098209028,"This restriction to only touch paint is droll. I want to use my Apple Pencil and fill in, have the option of 'pouring' paint or using strokes. That way, if I don't want to stay within the lines or if I want to add to the sketch I could!"
"12679",1098307964,"Just so cool, get it now, get all of the upgrades, tell your fiends, just get it"
"12680",1098307964,"If you like Iron Maiden then you obviously love Eddie. This game is fun and addictive for any fan! Download it it and try it out. I‚Äôve only been playing a couple of days and already have a 5 Star level Eddie in my team. Trust me once you start it will be very hard to stop!"
"12681",1098307964,"If the store allowed a negative rating these people would earn it. This game looks good and sounds good but it‚Äôs a nonstop cash grab bunch of crooked developers soiling the name of a legendary band. I‚Äôve played this game for well over a year and this week they‚Äôve decided to LOCK all skills earned or purchased and require another purchase to UNLOCK items. They want you to pay twice?!! They are dirtbag crooks and should be banned from the Ap store."
"12682",1099092384,"No onscreen controls. No pinching, zooming, manual control of perspective. Waste. Refund time."
"12683",1099092384,"There's no fast forward, scrub or anything for a video. I love there's no download or anything to a video from the library. I have to watch a video from the beginning to end, tap and it pauses? That's the most important, next is to set a point of view with the fingers. Videos start off default where I automatically have to turn my head to get to the right position, want to be able to pinch to perfect position. Will rate 5 stars when at least the fast forward/back is fixed."
"12684",1099092384,"This app is great for viewing VR images. Images can be viewed directly on screen or in a VR Headset. Can load multiple images and cycle through them by tapping the screen. Reads code to identify your VR headset via camera. Only issue is it needs an on-screen interface to switch images when in a VR headset."

"12688",1099176816,"Sophisticated and feature rich. Really blown away by the multi-layer flexibility, start and stop anywhere, probe deeper into the characters when you want to, interpretations and definitions when you need them. Very well thought out and executed."
"12689",1099176816,"Most of us have had to read one or two of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays in high school. But the problem was that Shakespeare was the last thing we were thinking about. The difficulty of language was a turn off, teachers themselves were not experts in the writing either, so what was the relevance to us? But I think Shakespeare is better appreciated when you have accumulated more personal experience meeting people and delving into some current affairs. I found Shakespeare a more pleasurable experience trying to learn it on my own free time and that is where this app really helps. It has annotations for the entire Tempest play and recorded voice work. So in addition to reading, you get to really ‚Äòlisten‚Äô to the words and the different pronunciations. Through this app, it made me confident to say that although Shakespeare is difficult, it does not mean that it can‚Äôt be fun. If you take the time and take a leap of faith with this app, I promise that you will have a better appreciation of Shakespeare and create an approachable and optimistic view of classic literature."
"12690",1099176816,"No other Shakespeare app comes close. When is the next one coming out?"
"12691",1099179070,"Crashes in Audiobus weird glitches after awhile nice layout needs more work"
"12692",1099179070,"It seems like MIDI mapping is broken. I go to the MIDI Learn page which highlights all of the various on-screen controls, and it says I should select one of the controls and then hit a MIDI note on my hardware device, but I can‚Äôt even select anything on the screen. I can long-tap to clear the MIDI mapping that exists already, but I can‚Äôt seem to tap to add a new one. With the exact same setup and settings, I don‚Äôt have this problem on DM1. I would email the developer but the ‚ÄúApp Support‚Äù links to Facebook - they don‚Äôt have a real website."
"12693",1099179070,"So I can use the drone machine but there is a high pitched wave constantly even with all the channels turned down. Drone machine boxes are disabled in the instrument tab or whatever. Bought it for the drone machine part. Unusable so far."
"12694",1099420627,"Not bad but an ad every third loss? That's ridiculous. Try every 5 or maybe every 10... So many ads I only play for like 5 minutes"

"12700",1099735932,"Starts out as a mildly fun, if not random, pachinko game. The randomness makes it silly impossible by about level 5. Uncontrollably bouncing through fires so that you die in one or two turns is... kind of anticlimactic. Needs some balancing and it could be worthwhile."
"12701",1099735932,"Retro throwback game. Arkanoid meets Smash TV. Amazing soundtrack and a steal for $0.99"
"12702",1099735932,"Pleasing to all the senses. So glad i took a chance on this. This will fight Alto's Adventure for my mobile gaming time now.  Support this talented developer!"
"12703",1099862552,"Yea, I definitely enjoy this game. Fun, fast pace, and has a lot to offer for customization, plus I like how your not forced to watch a ad every 5 seconds. My only problem is that the days feel way to fast, even for a higher level, but besides that, I really enjoyed it :)"
"12704",1099862552,"Don‚Äôt beg for ratings. It‚Äôs annoying. Had to give it a rating so it will go away. Otherwise, cute game."
"12705",1099862552,"It‚Äôs fun and easy to play. Just wish they would add descriptions of the smith‚Äôs special abilities"
"12706",1099950549,"I was enjoying the game until, like other gamers, I got to a place where the game stopped responding. For me, it was at the shooting range. I could select the bullet while in any other location, but at the range I couldn't select anything in my inventory. If I clicked on hints, it told me to use the bullet with the gun, but it wouldn't respond. I tried rebooting, backing out and coming back in, waiting a few weeks...nothing. I wasted my money on this; don't make the same mistake. (I am using an iPad Air 2.)"
"12707",1099950549,"Either this game is in serious need of an update or it is just sloppy. Hard to figure out sequences and slow responses. Garbage"
"12708",1099950549,"This game was clearly intended for larger screens. I play Tons of these HOPs and found it nearly impossible to read the captions. Games were actually so hard that I had to skip the majority of them and that was a surprise though. That was the only high point. Disappointed by this one Eipix!! You usually put out good titles."
"12709",1099995778,"Right off the bat, I am stuck because no matter how hard I try, I can't control the lock on the safe. Waste of money."
"12710",1099995778,"I enjoyed this and feel it deserves a good rating. I liked the variety of challenges and found it not as confusing as many I have played. There were zero glitches too! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèª So many games don't let me finish because they don't work properly."
"12711",1099995778,"Im surprise with some below average reviews. I thought the game was original and fun. In my opinion worth buying on sale."
"12712",1100023494,"Thought the game was good, but some of the puzzles were hard to get to work.  Good overall."
"12713",1100023494,"I enjoyed this game!!"
"12714",1100023494,"Overall I enjoyed this game, except it seemed to drag things out by constantly having to tap backward & forward to change scenes. Also, whoever wrote the script/narrations obviously has poor command of the English language or the editor didn't do a good job proofing spelling/grammar."
"12715",1100029269,"Just like most other BF games just a different story line & I think this was one of the worst I've played!! Forgot how much I paid, like 2.99. Cheesy characters and animated voices. Constantly have to go back and forth between scenes constantly. Only a few HO if you can call it that, more like find 5 leaves or feathers, or at most 5 objects that are too easy.  Wasn't worth 10Cents."
"12716",1100029269,"I would loved to have given the game 5 stars but after I didn't pick up an item I needed later in the game, I then found I couldn't go back for it.  Other than that I thought the game was great."
"12717",1100029269,"I was most of the way through the game when it became glitchy and crashed. On restart, lost items from inventory and couldn't go forward. This is the 1st in quite a while and it ticks me off."
"12718",1100092726,"This game is awful"
"12719",1100092726,"So you want a fun addicting game that is simaler to stack but you want something different or if you need a fun game that doesn't take up much storage that you will play well this is the game for you it is really fun and let me tell you you will come back again and again to play to try to bet your high score not only that you get cool stuff that you can buy in the store no money costed it has lots of different game modes that you can choose from and each are very fun and enjoyable no I am not hired to write this I really think this is a good and fun game that you should get cause you'll play it and won't regret getting it"
"12720",1100092726,"A very addictive game with a variety of different levels. It's fun, however it does have a lot of ads. Great for when you're bored with some time to kill."
"12721",1100094604,"This is one of the best apps to have and it is always fun"
"12722",1100094604,"I like playing in my spare time"

"12724",1100110635,"Most of the upper interface is cut off on the iPhone XR.   Please adjust accordingly."
"12725",1100110635,"Started off working good now it just stopped giving money can‚Äôt get money when not playing can‚Äôt upgrade going to delete just letting you know who reads this don‚Äôt waste your time"
"12726",1100110635,"I recently downloaded this game and really enjoy it, but the idle function not working is preventing any progress while I‚Äôm away. It‚Äôs pretty frustrating. If this is fixed I can give this game a 5 star review. The voices and animations are all awesome. I really hope this gets fixed."
"12727",1100139790,"Fun game, but graphics keep getting stuck and no game reset."
"12728",1100139790,"My toddler loves this game and plays it over and over. But ever since the update about two months ago, there‚Äôs a bug when you deliver ore to Skya, Ton Ton gets stuck. The only way to free him, is by earning a letter with another trux. But if you‚Äôve earned all the letters, your SOL. No feedback form in the app to submit bugs, otherwise I‚Äôd give this app 4 stars."
"12729",1100139790,"I hate this app because it‚Äôs to hard. and it‚Äôs not a good game"

"12731",1100147750,"I‚Äôm on the Freight Truck mission 36. Whenever the trailer hits a car, the trailer goes all crazy and starts flinging itself into the air. Up to the point where it lands from a great height and says I crashed."
"12732",1100147750,"There is a problem with this game I download it and it comes up as one through five is already done and then starting with six it says to Buy this level with the money and I click on it and it won't buy it so I can't advance to the next car can y'all see if y'all can do anything about that just tell me if there is a way to fix it"
"12733",1100292960,"It‚Äôs a great game!"
"12734",1100292960,"How can this game possibly not have online multiplayer in this day and age? A total waste of effort and relegated to the dustbin of history. Guess I‚Äôll go play some Caracassone."
"12735",1100292960,"It‚Äôs an okay game on a tablet, but the rules are not clearly instructed, the campaign is senselessly hard (luck is critical for certain missions) and the game is lacking an undo button for simple mistakes like over/under rotating a piece and accidentally placing it as such.  The actual board game is vastly superior, not simply as a matter of preference, but in the actual quality of game play."
"12736",1100331256,"This b*tch is fun"
"12737",1100331256,"Good game for the train. Just enough to pass the time.  Still good."
"12738",1100331256,"I love the dots franchise, really I do. But it is painfully obvious with this iteration that you absolutely do NOT complete levels if the game does not want you to OR unless you spend money. It‚Äôs unfortunate. I understand a need for profit but how about just charging me a cost for the game and then giving me a fair shake? Even the game mechanics do not behave consistently which is very frustrating (I.e. I have two lasers in one row but when both are used only one stone block is cleared). The companions who have power ups to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you usually end up ruining your strategy and make things more difficult.   I like the concept of these games, I just wish developers thought more about their supporters than their pockets."
"12739",1100472035,"This game is great! I've showed it to our three year old and every night before bed he wants to play Blocko! and every night he wants to see if Level 5 is open!   I've been impressed with this game and more so with how quickly he is learning to use logic to solve these puzzles.   We hope someone for GT will see the and post an update soon!   Thanks  4/12/18   Our three year old is now about to turn 5 in a few weeks... any progress on the new level? If not, please remove the coming soon...   Thank you"
"12740",1100472035,"I like the simplicity of playing this in portrait mode with one thumb. No ads no annoying pop ups. Please create more games like this."
"12741",1100472035,"Clever approach to classic slider type puzzles.  Great game play and Fun to play. Challenging enough to make you think, but not so hard that it's frustrating. No timers, lives, or what have you - just your brain against the puzzle.  Highly recommended. Thanks for making it."
"12742",1100591575,"Really love this game. It's well thought out and really quite beautiful. It is a challenging game and well worth the many hours spent crushing beams in its soothing pastel world."
"12743",1100591575,"It might be a great game???? Wouldn't know.   Sorry, I have many better things to do than sit around trying to GUESS how to play a game.  Hell, reading instructions would be just one of those many things. Actually playing the game with an understanding of what the moves and goals are would be another.  But I guess I'm going to go with deleting a game whose developers were too lazy or dense to provide any instructions instead."
"12744",1100591575,"I read the reviews about lack of instructions so decided to look on the App Store to see if there was anything to explain how to play this game.  There was, and the game is very simple, only cross same color lines. The dots at the top are a time bar to tell you how long each color will last and it's different each color.  I played for a couple minutes and was able to get up to seven same color lines crossed. It wasn't hard to play but wasn't that interesting or relaxing for me either. I'll probably keep the app on for a little while and see if I play it again and feel differently."
"12745",1100636064,"This app is amazing, it's like second soundcloud but way better, i can listen to all of my favourite music and download it. Hope u will evolve it more <3 <3 <3"
"12746",1100636064,"The application interface is friendly and easy to use, easy to set the songs I like on a list"
"12747",1100636064,"Good app, unlimited music and high quality, I can create a custom list of favorite songs general, listen to music every day helps the mind at ease, I will recommend it to my friends. I love itüòçüòç"
"12748",1100694944,"Very good game for $4. Kids have fun playing."
"12749",1100694944,"I bought this game for my three year old and she was bored within seconds. This game is mind-numbing. I wish I hadn't wasted $2."
"12750",1100694944,"I bought this app for my kid who loves curious George. Everyday for a week my kid would tell me he completed the first island but could not advance. I did not believe him so I tried it out myself. After completing all 10 levels, I could not advance. My friend downloaded the app and scored 3 stars on all levels but had the same problem as well. Overall, its a fun game for the ten levels you get."
"12751",1100723148,"I have bought tokens but they seem to disappear without using them.  Apple confirms that I‚Äôve paid for them but they are not credited to my token account. I want to purchase enhancements and the program says I am low in tokens. Help!!"
"12752",1100723148,"Best little secret for true creatives."
"12753",1100723148,"Firstly, I actually bought all the additional style packs but one. The styles say high definition readymade templates. This can be assumed by many people as the styles are ALREADY signature level detailed templates...they are not. That‚Äôs an additional charge each level of sharpness you want. Wahhh? Seriously?   Second, the level of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is a slider lol. You can see where your original line in an abstract digital painting for example was. It‚Äôs a filter. Pikazo styles get extremely similar the more you edit with the app. That‚Äôs awful when the templates CAN be much more amazing.   Thirdly, almost every app now has layers, offer double exposure options, ACTUAL filter editing (HSL, opacity, contrast etc etc)...and more. We want REAL editing options. Make OUR art not look the literal same as everyone else‚Äôs.   Printing is a cool idea but again not if the picture isn‚Äôt sharp. Charging us more is outright ridiculousness.   Make a REAL update please."
"12754",1100797913,"This is a fun game. The low star reviews are just people who can‚Äôt handle the real life challenges this game brings. It‚Äôs worth the money. Believe it, I‚Äôve probably downloaded and played over 200 games on iOS"
"12755",1100797913,"Plz update this app"
"12756",1100797913,"This game needs a major update the car don‚Äôt even have enough power and they don‚Äôt even go over obstacles you guys need to add 4low and lock differentials"
"12757",1100810556,"Fun game, no too hard, not too easy."
"12758",1100810556,"Have enjoyed all the Hidden Expedition games. Hope there are more new ones soon."
"12759",1100810556,"This game made me appreciate the features that Eipix always includes: the repayable puzzles and HOPs, and the ability to go back and pick up collectibles. I hate finishing a game and not knowing if I got all the collectibles, or finding I don‚Äôt have all the puzzle pieces and there‚Äôs no way to get them except doing it all over. I really enjoy replaying the HOPs and getting gold and 100% error free for each one. This game also had unusual scenes and an interesting plot."
"12760",1100883805,"Every time I try to do anything on it lately it logs me out and kick me out of the game! I‚Äôm sick of it. I don‚Äôt want to delete the game but it coming to come down to it!"
"12761",1100883805,"I‚Äôve had this game downloaded for awhile. The game is awesome. Little long on bud times I think. But still fun to play. I recently changed my Facebook. The game will not allow me to change it. 2. I‚Äôve recently subscribed to the newsletter, I got the success email but no potbucks have been deposited. 3rd. When I watch the videos I don‚Äôt receive my potbucks. None at all. I hope to resolve these issues. But in the meantime I‚Äôm still playing. üí®ü§ôüèº"
"12762",1100883805,"Getting really tired of not getting rewards for video ads"
"12763",1101109456,"i love this game but when disaster strikes you can‚Äôt keep everybody happy and while that is fair it just hits you one after another like i had a war then a fire then the death of a noble and the priesthood conspiracy so like chill out i couldn‚Äôt even do anything in between those events."
"12764",1101109456,"Good way to pass times and makes you think sometimes"
"12765",1101109456,"I love this game and recommend it to all! It's really fun I enjoy the fact that you can make your own choices! My dad loves this game too! Great game for all ages. üòÄ"
"12766",1101141411,"miss one prisioner"
"12767",1101141411,"Way too many ads. Outrageous to be subjected to numerous 30 second ads. Even going back to the Home menu triggers yet another ad."
"12768",1101141411,"No just no"
"12769",1101399354,"Even buying Big Fish games is not enough. Just trying to relax and not be interrupted to review their games. They‚Äôre just like Trump."
"12770",1101399354,"Enjoyed playing. The game does have all the things I enjoy in hidden object games. I like the morphing objects, collectibles and picture fragments in the scenes. I did have the game freeze up on me one time requiring me to reload it and start again. That is my reason for not giving it 5 stars."
"12771",1101399354,"Awesome game"
"12772",1101436320,"Two stars. 1) Because I love TLC and 2) because I love being able to watch my shows at any time.   BUT.   It is so totally aggravating that I can‚Äôt fast forward to the part of the show I left off on without sitting through every one of the 3 minute ads I already sat through, AND I can‚Äôt rewind even 2 minutes if I skipped ahead too far (after sitting through the ads again) without watching ANOTHER ad. It is excessive. It is obnoxious. The ads are longer than any other streaming service, and it takes away from the relaxation of evening TV.   Fix the ad problem."
"12773",1101436320,"There are plenty binge worthy shows on TLC but the app needs some help. I don‚Äôt suffer from the commercial problem.. not sure why. I get 4-5 commercials ever so often, not the 8-12 some others say they get.   However... it continuously tells me ‚Äúthis program is for users who subscribe to TLC‚Äù WHILE my account is logged in.. and I do have TLC in my cable subscription. I‚Äôll watch a few episodes in a row (I usually put something on my phone while I clean, cook dinner, etc) and then when the 3rd or 4th episode starts, I magically ‚Äúdon‚Äôt subscribe to TLC‚Äù and it won‚Äôt play.. I then have to log out and log in to be able to watch it. Super annoying.   Also - I watch with the app on the fire stick as well. Yes, we have cable but I rarely use it lol we just use the apps and pick and choose what to watch when we want. So I go to pick up where I left off on a TLC show on my tv that I started on my phone - it‚Äôs never accurate. It‚Äôs always further behind than I really am or further ahead"
"12774",1101436320,"Tv provider connection won‚Äôt work. Won‚Äôt let you sign in. No point to download."
"12775",1101472953,"I have ALWAYS loved these games and I have always loved big fish games"
"12776",1101472953,"This is an excellent long-play game with lots of new puzzles and extra bonuses. I loved it! It kept me entertained for hours on end."
"12777",1101472953,"I started buying the Big Fish games after playing one that was really great LEGAL LIGHT: SILENT MOUNTAIN. I thought they would all be like that game but they are obviously made by different game designers. The puzzles in this one only made sense about 10% of the time. Some of the things you had to do in the puzzles were just silly and no way you could figure it out without clicking aimlessly on everything. I found myself frequently clicking on the hint button and rolling my eyes ay the solution. At this point, I‚Äôm just hoping to the story ends soon."
"12778",1101501512,"I tried to place a purchase for 20 min and each time I saved the billing address, the app would automatically switch the shipping address (even though the button to sync them was off) and then when I updated the shipping address, it would clear all of my billing information so that I would have to re-enter. It literally wouldn‚Äôt let me make a purchase! Super frustrating! I ended up using my computer instead, but just a bummer to have wasted so much time trying to buy their product."
"12779",1101501512,"I love Lush, their products, and everything they do for charity work, but their app has a few problems that makes the experience less enjoyable. The website will show how many reviews it has and you can click on the reviews and read them. On the app, the number of reviews are typically wrong (ex. One product might have 600+ reviews on the website, but on the app it shows zero), and you can‚Äôt view the reviews. I love you Lush but please fix the app!"
"12780",1101501512,"For the love of God. I love you guys so much. I‚Äôve given this feedback via your support before. But, please put gift message/receipts as an option during check out in the app. I buy gifts for my girls and family members all the time and I have to go out of my way to find a computer or specifically use the web browser on my phone. I have to go out of my way to not use this app when I want to."
"12781",1101582722,"You can only keep playing if you spend money."
"12782",1101582722,"No explanation of reproduction time. And no way to pause passage of time to assess inventory."
"12783",1101582722,"Decided to replay the game after the last war patch, and I am glad to say it is a better game now for it than it was previously. Could still use a better English translation, but the current build I see so far is definitely better."
"12784",1101675121,"I HATE THIS GAME! I CAN'T GET PAST 3! IT'S SO DIFFICULT! MAKE AN EASIER CATCH THE BUS GAME!"

"12791",1101848745,"This game has great graphics but there just needs to be more to it. I mean, there are no rewards,no incentive, no real reason to keep playing. I have gotten all the frogs and even when you complete a ''challenge "" it's no big deal, you don't get anything! Heck now the ""bar"" isn't even moving anymore. Like I said, could be a good game, right now, so-so."
"12792",1101848745,"It won't open it crashes all the time. I haven't even got to play it! I just bought it and I don't get it. I'm so mad!!! Fix it or I wan my money back!! Now..!!"
"12793",1102339559,"Just downloaded the app and made a map for a bus route for tomorrow. Put in about 30 addresses and tried to email a link to someone else who is helping me pick people up. Looks like I can't email a link. He has the app too. In the process of trying to email my finger accidentally hit the delete button. lol. Any way you can add a ""are you sure you want to delete"" option? How about email option? I would gladly pay more $$$. Excellent app!"
"12794",1102339559,"Hi I love your app because I can place pins on a map for areas of interest. I‚Äôm using relay to plan a trip to New Orleans this spring. I suggest being able to add directions/lines to show your travel route and travel time (whether walking, driving, biking, or public transit) would be awesome too. Right now I had to write my whole itinerary in my notes and just used your app to see how close my saved places are in relation to one another so I have to go back and fourth between your app and my notes and google maps to get around how I want... which is a little too much juggling. I would love to use your app to plan a more detailed itinerary. I like the app but please make it a little more handy!"
"12795",1102339559,"Really handy app! However, for long travel where adding a lot of destinations are necessary, a macOS version of this would be extremely helpful. It‚Äôs very difficult to add lots of points on an iPhone."
"12796",1102346079,"pls add more cars and places and destruction in the coming updates,a very great game"
"12797",1102346079,"This game is really good but the problem is the game needs more content like new cars and tires and stickers maps and obstacles  creator if you read this please and this content üëç"

"12805",1102411902,"Thanks!"
"12806",1102411902,"The game is not too hard, but not too easy. Very logical.  I was surprised when I thought the game was over, but I started over and thought ""remember your logic!""  Can't wait to find more apps like this.  Plus it's free with very few ads."
"12807",1102411902,"One inventory item is hidden a little too well. Otherwise, clues are hard but mostly manageable."

"12820",1102742855,"As a long time pilot and a fan of the Red Bull Air Race series, I was excited to see this app.  I have reached the max level of updates for both of the Class D planes I have gotten for free in the app.  Tried buying gold but the purchases never registered. I have reached as far as I can go in the game without a Class C plane to remain competitive.  My maxed out upgrades for my planes are no longer fast enough to win.  This game needs to be updated so those pilots who do well are rewarded with more than just rivets and bolts!  Give us more blueprints.  I am not going to overpay your ridiculous prices for ‚Äúgold‚Äù to purchase more blueprints so I can build more planes.  I would rather spend that money putting real gas in real airplanes and going flying...for real. I also have come close to pylons in a 90 degree bank and it registers as a pylon hit.  When in a 90 degree bank, there needs to be the option to use the elevator to tighten the turn and increase turn rate. Not realistic flying characteristics at all.  Needs updating....period.  I am losing interest in this game."

While he does seem to like these apps the big issue is that there is no sound unless your using headphones. I have this issue with all 3 apps from the bundle. My son is only 5 so it is not a typical thing for me to allow him to wear headphones when using his iPad. I already did a trouble shooting with apple and the issue is only with the apps in this bundle. Would love for it to work and function fully."

Came here to find out that it‚Äôs a MONTHY FEE to use the puzzles. What a scam. The app is great and works phenomenally but charging a monthly fee for two second puzzles is baffling. Maybe attempt to be less greedy or at least be up front that it‚Äôs monthly fee and not an outright purchase."
"12834",1103201207,"Toddler loves this games however very deceiving with charge.  It‚Äôs a monthly cost.  Very disappointed with this not being upfront"
"12835",1103278932,"This thing has hair trigger controls so death comes easily and often and every time DOUBLE ads are played which is absolute nonsense. Such an approach to free to try is annoying and nonsense. Shame you didn‚Äôt just put this out to straight up buy from the start and bypass the irritation. Then again looking at other reviews you can pay and STILL gets ads. Move on from this developer there are too many other good ones out there that don‚Äôt resort to petty tactics."
"12836",1103278932,"This game has gotten me fully addicted. The ads can wait. I don‚Äôt care. I have played and then deleted the game multiple times but I always realize that I should‚Äôve kept it. LOVE THIS GAME."

"12847",1103631263,"Paid no ads, still get promo vids of other games when wanting to continue current game, not cool."
"12848",1103631263,"I love this game! I thought it was super hard at first but I gradually improved and it feels like my visual-spatial area of brain is improving. I like that there are also achievements, however I find that the game is slow in recognizing some of them. For instance, I've bought all skins with coins, at least what I can see but it will says I have more to buy. Kind of weird. Other than that it's a great game. Ads aren't that bad when you can skip, plus they're really short!"
"12849",1103631263,"Fun game and I like the concept but every time you make a mistake you have to start over. I would prefer where you continue on to different levels and start using more strategy not just speed until you die then have to start all over again."

"12854",1103804173,"This game is amazing! Every aspect of the game is very well done, from the menus down to the gameplay. You can tell the developers put a lot of time into this game. As for the comment of 0 replay ability well that is totally bogus. This game is a high score chaser, so that right there is incentive to replay! Awesome game guys, I hope to see more games from you in the future!"
"12855",1103804173,"Pretty fun game, no issues whatsoever."

But then about two weeks after I got the app, an email came in saying I had been charged 1.99 for the app?!?! What is this random charge they've given me? There's no talk of it in the details on the App Store, nor within the app at all!! Not too happy"

When you click on support you get either a blank screen or opens up a Outlook configuration screen.  I wish I had my money back.  You would do better with a stone table and a chisel."

My primary feedback is I wish you would make the levels more challenging. For example, I just finished Level 1375 which was Fish. Some of the words that solved it were ‚Äúfin‚Äù, ‚Äúgill‚Äù, ‚Äúaquatic‚Äù. I mean come on! Surely, you can up the ante a bit and put in harder words like types of fish or names of fish species and use some lesser known fish. The game, at these levels should be more intellectually difficult as it progresses.  Additional Feedback: I understand you having to support yourself with ads. But could you please add the ability to silence them? It is EXTREMELY aggravating to start the game and have the ad start blasting its stupid music or whatever other noise it‚Äôs music."

Currently it‚Äôs taking almost 2 gigs of space just for an idle game and that‚Äôs a bit ridiculous. No other idle games I have require NEARLY that much space. Also, this game loves sucking up battery.   If you guys can find a way to reduce space required and battery usage, I‚Äôd most likely rate this 4 or 5 stars, but until then, it‚Äôs staying a 3.

"12966",1106493268,"First of all, I love tower defense games with real time combat, I‚Äôm also a sucker for retro style games and rockin‚Äô chiptunes.  This game checks ALL those boxes, AND it has VERY solid gameplay!    So why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Because: 1) Items are WAY over priced in the in-game shop during gameplay 2)I thought Slayin ‚Äúfame‚Äù points cost a lot, but it takes THOUSANDS of ‚Äúsoul‚Äù points to unlock anything!  4 characters is cool, but couldn‚Äôt there be more?  SUGGESTIONS: - Cloud support!  - Maybe a coin and/or soul point doubler in app purchase that can be ‚Äúrestored‚Äù on other devices.  I‚Äôd drop some real $$$ for that! -Lower the in-game shop prices!  Too expensive to upgrade character! -Add more characters like a ‚ÄúPaladin‚Äù or even ‚Äúcleric‚Äù type character that can not only take tons of damage, but also heal.  A ‚ÄúRifleman‚Äù distance attack character that uses firearms would be pretty rad too.  Anyway, definitely a very solid and well made game, but if some minor tweaks would be made, this would be a 5 star must play classic!"
"12967",1106510521,"The app is cute and easy to use for a child. You can either use your current location or enter a zip code. However, living in Arizona where it regularly gets over 100 degrees, it just shows ""1.."" for the temperature and not the actual temperature. Hopefully, that can be fixed because otherwise it is a good app and would get 5 stars."

"12997",1107741196,"The artwork and music in this game are breathtaking, as has been notes in many other places. I love many things about the gameplay, such as the well designed and creative abilities and synergies between the heroes. I played through the Mac version of the first game on the computer and I‚Äôm halfway through the second on mobile.  The reason for 4/5 is I keep finding myself wanting certains small changes for conveying information during combat (that wouldn‚Äôt change gameplay at all, but make it easier / more convenient to get all the information about what is happening). Specifically: 1) I mostly use the show all armor / strength display in the top right to get an overview of strong enemies still left on the field. It would be a really helpful thing to do something like add a red outline around the displayed armor / str of enemies to more easily sort through the information at a glance, when there are many units clumped together; currently the display is the same for your own units and enemies, making it quite confusing in the case of many units bunched together. This feels like such an obvious small touch that I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs missing given the attention to small details through the whole game as a whole.  2) The biggest lack I feel is the ability to quickly ascertain enemy turn order. In order to figure out the enemy‚Äôs turn order you have to click through each portrait, see where they are on the board, then use the clunky armor / str display to see how much damage the enemies can do etc. If there are more enemies than fit in the queue, tough luck. The game mechanics of this game are very similar to Into the Breach (the biggest difference being the fact that each side gets a turn with all their units in that other game) and I would love to have a button like Into the Breach does for a quick overview of enemy turn orders: when you press it, it shows numbers next to each enemy unit, 1 for the next enemy unit in the queue, 2 for the one after etc  Anyway, great job with the game! Even though I mostly focused on what I wish the game implemented, it‚Äôs still a work of art and wonderful design. It‚Äôs effective at creating a real atmosphere, and the ending of the first game made me cry :*) Perhaps someone has made mods to the pc version with my desired features, Imay have to look into that :)"
"12998",1107741196,"As a fan of Norse lore, this game really hits home with me.  Both a masterpiece of gameplay and storyline."
"12999",1107741196,"I enjoyed the game and don‚Äôt regret my purchase. The soundtrack, as with the first Banner Saga, is amazing. I continue to love the hand-drawn art and the unique setting. But the writing took a big step backward in the sequel. I was mostly satisfied with the content of the story, but the style of the writing was sometimes flippant, cheesy and generally much less mature than the first one. I‚Äôll be purchasing the third as soon as it is released on iOS because I do feel attached to seeing how the story ends. But I hope the quality is back to the standards of the first one."
"13000",1107742773,"This game is great when you relive stress or just want a simple game to play."
"13001",1107742773,"Ridiculous videos and no character selection. Just a poorly executed rehash."
"13002",1107742773,"This game is really fun and addictive but it doesn't give you the option to change characters after you have already took the time to watch a video and get a character that you really liked.üòû"

"13004",1107822876,"Fun game!"
"13005",1107822876,"I downloaded this game yesterday when I was looking for a different cooking game. As I see, this game has good graphics and the game itself is quite entertaining and relaxing cause you don't have to think much. The drawbacks is the sound, it's kinda weird and loud but you can ignore it if the game operates well and you enjoy it"

"13008",1107880005,"Bought this day one and loved it. Then went free and I was given the tank for purchasing when it was a premium game. Reinstalled and no tank and no way to get it back. Please help"
"13009",1108185975,"I have enjoyed previous Adventures in this series; However, this offering has very little to recommend it.  Although the plot initially feels interesting enough, it quickly bogs down under its current own current, with repetitious HO's, stale puzzles, and mediocre graphics.  There is no map, leaving the hint button for all transport.  Placement of the tall lighthouse hint button causes frequent accidental striking of that area, as does the X on the top right of the screen, which is struck during zoom procedures.  The game feels old and stale, and I found myself looking forward to its end.  There is no lag between screens, and HO's are properly reactive to touch.  The game is moderately short, although it seems longer because of its insistence on getting multiple portions of items before they can be used.  Recommendation:  Pass, unless you are desperate to something while you watch your grass grow in the winter."
"13010",1108185975,"I liked the story but the games were somewhat boring. The game wasn't that long (paid version) but made up for it in bonus game. Also it was annoying to continue to get the adds and popups after i purchased the game for $6.99."
"13011",1108185975,"Game was ok, kind of tedious at times. I don't like this new trend of paying for the game upfront without getting to try it out first. Also, the prices have increased substantially. In this case, I didn't enjoy it enough to where I felt I got my money's worth. HOPs were really small to see, and you had to go into settings to see the interactive map, so that was an unnecessary extra step. Story was ok, gameplay fairly long, loads of HOPs if that's your jam. Overall, it felt like it was from a few years ago, could use some more development."
"13012",1108206682,"Wasting your time in ads & you can't get any fun"
"13013",1108206682,"Even after paying 2$ to remove the ad. The ads still appear like crazy. Also there is no option to restore purchases. DON'T BUY"
"13014",1108206682,"This game is easily one of the worst I've played. Nice graphics and cube models. But it has lots of ads and the timing on the jumps are terrible! How did this game go 4 version with this being fixed?!?!!"
"13015",1108340786,"It was fun at first, when it was relatively easy. But as you progress further on, it starts to become a game where you're just memorizing the track, since it goes to fast to comprehend the different objects."
"13016",1108340786,"Too easy"
"13017",1108340786,"My cousins can't get off my phone because of this game!! So addicting!"
"13018",1108384425,"this game is wack. Then you people gone put a ‚Äúbuy full version‚Äù as if the game was GOOD. I‚Äôm not satisfied. hmph"
"13019",1108384425,"So I was liking the game and like 10 minutes through it said I had to buy the full version to continue. So yeah it‚Äôs not a game it‚Äôs a trial."
"13020",1108384425,"This game is really great. I love the game. Can we get more levels though. It was so much fun and I want more levels."
"13021",1108417718,"Yes, you can make to level 3 on your own without paying to level up. however, that stupid out of time sound is the number one reason for the low rating. It is also the reason I won‚Äôt pay, too much obvious manipulation."
"13022",1108417718,"It‚Äôs a great game that‚Äôs well executed unfortunately I find myself chucking the phone on the couch next to me rather than playing. That‚Äôs because the levels quickly become frustrating with constant ball returns (slides that take the ball right back to where you flipped it from) and too little time to move forward. Combine that with tiny finger buttons that are easy to miss and flippers that don‚Äôt seems to always flip the ball in the direction you‚Äôd think they would and it can quickly become tedious when not advancing. It‚Äôs a perfect game to zone out to with the it‚Äôs melodic sound track but the gameplay doesn‚Äôt allow it. I suggest a setting embraces the fun of pinball without constantly being under the pressure of a clock. That and bigger butting areas. That would make this a five star game for me."
"13023",1108417718,"I love this game. I sit around my headphones on playing in the back of a Lyft Or standing in line at the bank end it anywhere I‚Äôve got a moment and want to be in another world. Good job guys a really really original game!"
"13024",1108465034,"This makes it harder than it needs to be. I would rather solve puzzles than struggle to face the direction or thing I thought I was navigating to."
"13025",1108465034,"This was my least favorite game of all."
"13026",1108465034,"Very good challenge, plays well, no glitches, has a save, and ads are not intrusive.  The puzzle box under the telephone had me stumped..I hit on the solution at random after trying my logic (lol) several times.  No online walkthrough posted yet..I just kept at it and got lucky.  Hope to see more from this dev..thank you!"
"13027",1108475553,"This is how old my last review for this game was, the iPhone X has been out for over two years, and they have still not updated the game for the screen.   Please, fix this. It is such an amazing game, that deserves the bigger and better screen fit for it.   Edit 03/13/18 - I still love this game, but please update it for iPhone X screen. It hasn‚Äôt had an update in almost a year, please at least fix it for the iPhone X screen.   After finishing this game, I can say for certain it is amazing as a port on mobile.  I played it on my iPhone 7, and never had any issues with it.  The controls were actually the most surprising thing to me, as for a touch game they worked great! Most of the complaints I see for the controls stem from using the classic option. I wasn't a fan of it, and once I switched to expert, it felt amazingly smooth. I wish more games had this kind of flow for the controls, as most of why I couldn't put this game down was because of the controls being so surprisingly good.  If you want a great WRPG, that has meaningful choices through out, get this now!"

"13030",1108507977,"Fellow Former Big Fish gamers that wanted NewReleases, You are really Missing The Boat! Since we are No Longer getting New Releases for us IPad users, you need to go to the App Store and in search: Type in Hidden object games for IPad. The filter at the top left, then hit New Releases.   * There are several AWESOME Games NewFrom our friends at Elephant games. They offer a FREE Trial and are a 1 time unlock purchase price. Trust me - These games are OUTSTANDING! & WELL WORTH THE PRICE. Hope this helps - PLEASE CHECK THEM OUT, as a couple of us regular Dream Team gamers have worked VERY HARD at getting games for us IPAD users again.  As far as this game:  It was good as well, but as you know it is an Older game - Well worth playing. Big Fish, for those of you who haven‚Äôt realized it yet, we will be getting NO NEW RELEASES from Big Fish anymore!  This is a down right shame as we iPad users were all Very Loyal Supporters.  Your going to have to look elsewhere Now! Kdboots"
"13031",1108507977,"Enjoyable game! It‚Äôs a typical hidden object game with a cheesy plot, but it has an enjoyable story and well designed cutscenes. I love how it‚Äôs pay one time for the entire game because you can really immerse yourself in the puzzles."
"13032",1108507977,"UPDATE: For those of you who are going to this review site it is  November 10, 2018. If you are upset that BigFish is not giving us anymore new HOAG and re-releasing the old ones, try and contact me somehow. You can reach me at lynxminx @icloud.com. If anyone can get ahold of KimTwilight, it would help. BigFish will only release games with coins and energy and I won‚Äôt play those money draining games! We need a game plan, because there is a new CEO at BigFish and he is responsible for eradicating this entire genre. I hope someone sees this before BigFish or the App Store deletes my review. Reviewers pass along the info along with the way to reach me any way you can.  I have a couple of ideas. But I need help, someone who is tech savvy! Thanks everyone! DRACYY! I had to PAY 5 COINS FOR A MOUSE! A warning would have been appreciated, lol!  Anyway, this was a terrific game. You could customize settings. The graphics were totally magnificent. The game was decently long and had a long bonus chapter. This was my favorite type of game: a fairy tale, twisted as it might be! It was a cross between Rumpelstiltskin and Sleeping Beauty gone wrong. Loading was not quite instantaneous between  locations but the lag time was short. At each location you collect roses and morphing objects. There was no actual journal but objectives were regularly updated. Inventory was labeled and interactive and there were complex items to assemble. There was a marked, if so customized teleport map to transport you. The HO scenes had some variation. Luckily there wasn't an overabundance of them, because you didn't have an alternative. There were many puzzles and games. Some were fun and others were boring rotational stuff that I believe we are all tired of doing. Even so, this game was so gorgeous and fun to play that I didn't care about the puzzles so much.  The gimmick in this game was a wish box which helps you in exchange for drops of blood. It sounds morbid but really is not. It was fun because you learn more of the story and receive help in the game. I deducted a star for the following reasons: lack of a cohesive journal, small lag loading and also for the map to update itself, and too many rotational puzzles. However, all in all it was still an amazing game and I will play it again! It was magical, interesting and exquisite all at the same time. Lynxie sends üíã‚ù§Ô∏èüòò to Dracyy, KimTwilight, and the rest of the tireless and diligent DTE! Remember, our work is never done and the better our reviews, the better this genre gets! So thanks to all of you for your hard work!"

"13039",1108623942,"I just started the game but so far it seems clever.  Not too hard but not too easy.  It's holding my interest.  Some interactive things I've not seem in other games. Refreshing!"
"13040",1108623942,"Cannot select chalice on final HOP. Therefore cannot complete the game and access bonus content. App support redirects you to forums. Save your money."

"13045",1108733742,"This app provides a very simple, clean, and enjoyable iPad environment for writing with Apple Pencil. It is incredible how close to writing on paper this is, even when writing in very small detail. I have 22 (twenty-two!) writing apps (notebook and sketching) on my iPad Pro and this is at least 10 times closer to writing on paper than any of them. Even the most popular note-taking apps do not interpret my handwriting like a physical notepad does (they often fail miserably). Note Always is amazing at making my writing look exactly as it would on paper.  I have only one request. I know this is a simple writing app, but if I could annotate PDFs on this, it would be absolutely perfect for me. Please, please add the feature to import PDFs. This would make it 5-stars!  Thank you for creating this gorgeous app."

I can see spending 5$ on it, but that‚Äôs about it. The app is not user friendly and doesn‚Äôt have a help button to allow for easy tips and tricks other than how to use the eraser. How do I get my money back?"

"13052",1109024890,"Controls just feel awkward but I think that's just the curse of touch screen for me. There's a part in the end of 2-13 right before getting to the totem, where you have a timed challenge but the attack button covers up a rock that's in your way. It's not so bad in normal play but with a timed challenge it's a little awful. Game is not bad though"

"13056",1109425556,"I was learning this and enjoyed it because there wasn‚Äôt a limit on mistakes like with Duolingo. But it wants me to have decks. No explanation about what decks are or how you are suppose to get them. So I guess I‚Äôm done."
"13057",1109444394,"I like this game. It's really really fun! But there's too many ads and i hate ads and its really addicting but still less ads üòí"
"13058",1109444394,"I love this game it's so fun and I could play it for hours. but I hate the newest update. I wish it was back to the original where it was always the bird as the player and always the ghosts flying across the screen /:"

"13060",1109489005,"In learning points of sail it shows PORT side to be on the RIGHT. Which is exactly opposite of what it should be. PORT side is on the LEFT!!! I want my money back."
"13061",1109489005,"Great app.  Helps me learn to sail better."
"13062",1109489005,"Love this app, great add-on to the basic keel boat course I‚Äôm taking right now.   The only thing I wish this app had was a sailboat terminology lesson. A 3D setup of a sailboat with a vocabulary word match game would be immensely helpful. Confused as to why this was left out because of how important it is. They recently updated the app so I have hope that it will continue to improve"
"13063",1109545844,"What a great storyline.  I read some other reviews about glitches but I didn‚Äôt experience any at all. The lag time between scenes WAS a little long however and my only other critique was that some of the shaded or darker areas in HOPs was too muted and I had to use hints to finish.  Best part? Seemed I played forEVER and I like getting my money‚Äôs worth!  Great story, great graphics and love that little Imp!"
"13064",1109545844,"I really enjoy this game, especially the little elf helper! I read that some people complained about scenes taking a long time to load but that‚Äôs probably due to their system. They do take a little longer to load but if it‚Äôs extraordinarily long, it‚Äôs your system and not the game."

"13071",1109751921,"I think the game would be a lot more fun if we could play with a friend. Also, even if the rank is under 50, the AI always has more bishops and knights than us, which are the best pieces in the game."

But ofcourse one suggestion, no game centre guys, need to think about it. Thanks"

"13091",1110447884,"Looks like an older game but i played games that are 3 years old that were better than this. Lackluster graphics, not the best puzzles and dumb story."
"13092",1110447884,"I really didn't care for this one, although for the money, I shouldn't complain.  Other ones in this series were much better.  This one seemed plain with fewer scenes and a lot of back and forth."

"13102",1111311076,"This game took my breath away. There‚Äôs a sense of a fearless imagination behind this that‚Äôs amazing and exciting. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else she‚Äôs working on."
"13103",1111311076,"In this text-based RPG, you play as a combination firewall/fire elemental, protecting a few people and places from magical and technological threats. If you're like me, that's enough to try it out, and if you do you won't be disappointed.  It's short-ish and linear, but there are so many things to learn and try it has good replayability. I'm very looking forward to Open Sorcery 2."

"13105",1111420122,"I like the app, but my belly keeps hitting the chat feature or my hand. Is there a way to move the feature or make it available another way? Makes the app hard to use when it just wants to open chat."
"13106",1111420122,"Thought it would be a cool app. Pregnant with twins, now 26 weeks. I have fetal Doppler at home and know exactly where to find heartbeats for each one so I figured using this would be easy and something I could use away from home. Well i think it‚Äôs a waste. Cant find/hear either heartbeat and don‚Äôt have patience to try for an hour trying to hear something."

"13108",1111504185,"This app/book version of Hawkins famous laymen book is just an amazing piece of learning. This makes much more accessible and understandable the complex and awesome topics dealt by Hawkings as he explains how our universe works. I am just in awe at how creative he is to produce one of a kind    e-book like this. The pace, illustrations and connections of topics within the book are so helpful and so appropriate for the new generation used to tweets and small bites of information. You can flip over some topics when you have some time, learn some amazing fact, and come back later which no rush or worry about how fast you are progressing through the book. Hope other books on complex topics are translated to this format. And I love the updates of the latest science since the publication of the original book. We have learned so much in the last decade that I agree with Hawkins, it is an honour to live in this times."

"13126",1112071930,"Nice game, good graphics, but......... There are game parameters that are difficult to work with.  Never really understood the ‚Äúflavor‚Äù of individual origami warriors, never really understand the function of the glowing balls in matching, can‚Äôt figure out why some warriors have different effects when battling, and WORST of all is the short timed sections.  Why must every game be an exercise in fast button pushing?  And finally, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any access to a support or app maker website or interaction mechanism.  So we end up making comments like this.  Makers:  1.  Eliminate the short timed sequences (level 35 is unwinnable!) 2.  Put in a rules/rationale/strategy page so we can understand what the special features mean 3. Create a website so questions can be asked/answered  I DO really like what has been created so far and would like to continue with it."

"13151",1112540727,"To all the people who hate this game,  Play the original game they made before this one. Tiki Taka soccer was a great game. The international version was something of DLC. It is fun, and exiting. It's not even that much faster than the old one. On Tiki Taka I had a striker named Straddle, absolute legend. He scored over one hundred goals in a season. Twice. He felt like he had the same speed as William. So, if anything they made the game feel slower. Maybe it was the higher camera, I don't know, but this is a great game no matter what."

Secondly i bought a group package and after a couple of turns, the game is still locking, requesting I buy it again. I check to see if i have the group package and it says purchased. I check to buy the mode individually. On the picture it says .99¬¢ but once i click to purchase, it says $1.99. This feels both buggy or at least like a scam. Please fix."

"13158",1112858566,"I don‚Äôt like this game because it had too many adds and I could barely play the game and after a certain amount of cards that I went through the purchase menu would pop up. And it kept popping up and I couldn‚Äôt play the game like I wanted to."
"13159",1112861301,"Hello I am deciding whether or not I should ask for a refund.

"13172",1113473319,"This tuner worked so well I was considering leaving my other tuners out of my guitar cases.  However, a few months ago, I suddenly found that the tuner was off.  It now registers my 440 tuning fork as about D#.  Apple recently admitted it slowed down older iphones, which they may have done to my iphone (through IOS updates I installed?) and caused the tuner to read about 3/4 what it should. If you are going to load this on an older iphone, perhaps the IOS ""updates"" will screw it up."
"13173",1113473319,"I looked at a dozen tuner apps. It came down to Boss and Fender.  I loaded both and tried them a couple times.  The Fender app didn‚Äôt like the low B string - couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhear‚Äù it well.  The Boss app performed well with all 6 bass strings!  The chromatic mode locked in quick to each pluck.   I turn my phone on it‚Äôs side and set it directly onto the amplifier face. This displays only the tuning graphics and they are large enough to read from floor level.  When using TU-3W (black) mode my phone remains discrete.   This is the next best option to an in-line tuner!"

Gameplay has been formatted for the mobile experience but the navigation is practically the same. It can be cramped at times on a phone but it‚Äôs still playable. There‚Äôs only one aspect that I wish was included, and that‚Äôs the sandlot mode where you were free to design your own rides and parks with no restrictions. I can get past that though because this is much more than I ever expected from RCT on mobile."

"13180",1113756219,"Super challenging and super addicting. Love this game!"
"13181",1113756219,"I broke my phone cause of this game"
"13182",1113756219,"I liked the game, it's just every couple times I died I would get another annoying  ad, if this app had no ads I would've rated 5 stars"
"13183",1113943452,"Please make some of your games free for limited time"
"13184",1113943452,"I downloaded this game today because it said it was free with App Gratis. The problem is, whenever I load the game, it said that the build has expired, and I need to upgrade. Then it gives me an OK button, but when you click the the OK button, that goes away. I have no idea how to upgrade, and I don't even know if I have the $.99 version of the game, or if I still have the free version, but it's very confusing as to what I'm supposed to do if I only have the free version instead of the promised paid version that is supposed to be  free. It doesn't say whether it's supposed to remove ads, or whether there are extra levels, or what the difference between the paid and free versions are."
"13185",1113943452,"Horrible JUTS HORRIBLE!!!!"
"13186",1114061571,"This keyboard isn't like others. It's a copy paste which doesn't work in notepad, text or Facebook. Frankly I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be able to paste these emojis to. Not worth the space on your phone."
"13187",1114061571,"I really love these cute emojis!! But why do I have to pay for all the new ones when I already paid for the app?? ü§î hoping for a new update when full access.."
"13188",1114061571,"Loved this app. But already paid for it and now I have to pay for MORE? That's not fair!!!"
"13189",1114127463,"The text cuts off when in vertical mode, have to turn the phone horizontally to actually read the text"
"13190",1114127463,"Haven‚Äôt tried to play the game in months. Can‚Äôt get it past opening screen on iPhone XR. Support site in store doesn‚Äôt work. Game hasn‚Äôt been updated in 10 months. Not sure what the issue is."
"13191",1114127463,"Can‚Äôt be played in portrait on an iPad for some strange reason"
"13192",1114130722,"It's a fun little game. I've always liked platformers like this. The problem I have with this game is it's is somewhat glitchy. I often run into invisible walls and sometimes I get sunk into the ground. If you are jumping from the edge of a platform, it will not allow you to jump twice,  assuming that the jump was already on its second jump. In the 12th level, I keep getting stuck between the rail and the ground when I am riding in the rail cart... then I die and have to start the whole level over again.  Little things like that can ruin a game. I hope they improve this game, because I really do like it and it is worth a play through even with the glitches."
"13193",1114130722,"It's just my personal opinion but I enjoyed the first one more"
"13194",1114130722,"It's a really cool game it's like a game boy if you like old school games then you should get this game"
"13195",1114170869,"Played this game as a kid and loved it! Was really excited to play it again on my phone (iPhone XR), but there is no sound. Super bummed! Please fix so I can update my review."
"13196",1114170869,"This game was incredible as a kid and this app is flawless! If you are like me, then you want the original sound and graphics. This app delivers with both the original graphics and the updated graphics as options. I loved it and continue to enjoy it. Buy it now! You won‚Äôt regret it. :)  Developers: Please consider a part 2! Get the old cast together and see what new adventures you guys can come up with!"
"13197",1114170869,"Just downloaded and no sound."
"13198",1114261491,"Keeps one occupied and with the different game modes you can keep going without getting bored for some time."
"13199",1114261491,"Watch ads IS REQ'D to play trashcan mode, then good luck scoring what you need to unlock players in that mode. THAT IS LAME.   Other reqs for unlocking players is impossible.   Kick is always from same angle. Not realistic.   Same background/stadium. Gets old.   Needs more stats: AVG SCORE would be nice, total rounds played, total lifetime goals scored."
"13200",1114261491,"This game is really fun, I'm hooked"
"13201",1114483079,"DEAR GAAAHD allow for the music to be removed!!!!!"
"13202",1114483079,"Does not provide any strength or weakness information. This seems like it would be the most basic information that should be offered."
"13203",1114483079,"This app doesn't currently offer any information unique to Pokemon Go, nor does it look like there is space reserved for it. Shows basic type, weight, height, and evolutions, but not much more than that."
"13204",1114594263,"It's fun kinda addicting amazing gameplay and of course good job :) :) :)"
"13205",1114594263,"The game is outstanding. It would be one of the best dual sticks on ios if it was not for the controls. I play with a mfi controller and the only time if I have died was because the controls are jittery. My character will shake to the left or right which makes the game impossible in the later levels when there are many traps and you need precision. So I tried to play without my controller and for me it's unplayable, it becomes an entirely different game where you can only fire in 4 directions which makes it no longer a dual stick shooter. So if we can get the controls fixed this is 5 star game for sure. I want to die because I make a mistake, not because of the controls."
"13206",1114594263,"It good I just feel like it hard to move the characters"
"13207",1114606759,"It‚Äôs a really fun and entertaining game, love the idea and the game itself! But there are times where after reading an email when I would go to close the button doesn‚Äôt work, or.. any button! I started freaking out as the hunger and bill meter went down and there was nothing I could do! I thought this was the cause of pressing on the ‚Äúclick here you‚Äôre a winner‚Äù spam button in the shop. But even after deleting the game and re-downloading it, it still did the same thing! Please fix because I would love to keep playing! But the buttons not working is keeping me from downloading it again."
"13208",1114606759,"The game eventually stops responding to touch causing me to have to close the app and lose progress. This really stinks if you‚Äôre in the middle of a higher paying job because you will fail and then be stuck cleaning dishes or flipping burgers."
"13209",1114606759,"The games great, I love the idea, the mini games and the panic. My only thing is that sometimes things become unclickable or they just don‚Äôt respond. So I can panic and tap on the fridge but it doesn‚Äôt do anything, so I‚Äôd have to save and quit and then open up the save again to make it work.  Other than that, love the idea! Maybe more new added jobs while we‚Äôre at it?"
"13210",1114681193,"I think that every time u die u should have the same length as you did before"
"13211",1114681193,"It‚Äôs a good game but it‚Äôs too hard too many ads are you just still got really small don‚Äôt get it"
"13212",1114681193,"Hate it because I hate the creators"
"13213",1114692553,"It‚Äôs really fun and different from superhot vr but basically the same, and still really fun!"
"13214",1114692553,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"13215",1114692553,"Fantastic game, but the concept‚Äôs spoiled by a wall of death that chases you. Would gladly pay for a version without any time constraints."
"13216",1114710947,"Easy to use."
"13217",1114710947,"I don‚Äôt think so!"
"13218",1114710947,"Over all it is a great app but then again there isn‚Äôt much to do."
"13219",1114718412,"Could you not put the restart button right next to the continue button? Also, there is no reason for a single plant to be able to ruin your whole level."
"13220",1114718412,"I love the game"
"13221",1114718412,"Before i even install the game dubai's taxis are not like that fromthe pictures these are from ny which is new York. i havnt tested thr game yet as they said dont judge a book by its cover but i hope you see this message and share"

"13225",1114811228,"Awesome! Loved it! Need and update and more chapters ASAP!"
"13226",1114811228,"I loved the original game but this game was not my favorite, sure there is multiple endings but there is only one season and that's not worth the 4$ I paid for it so the only thing that I can say is that it is a waste of time and money ."
"13227",1114811228,"Good game but needs to be longer. Maybe three seasons?"
"13228",1114886979,"This game is awesome üëè is the Best is the moment when you‚Äôre ready amp ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è love it I‚Äôll add it to my favorites"
"13229",1114886979,"This game I awesome I would give it a prize if I could of one of the best games ever and I have so grate ideas for more games ü§óüòÑ‚ò∫Ô∏è Grate ideas for the game: Toca boca zoo, Toca boca Mansion/houses and city and departments whith school and a church to get mearid but can it be free please!!!!!!!!!!! if not my mom maybe she can‚Äôt buy it because you have to pay for it and I‚Äôm a really big fan of Toca boca so please be free and iwhant you listen Toca boca I‚Äôm so excited for this game I really love Toca boca and please do these games I‚Äôm stil an 8 year old"
"13230",1114886979,"Okay toca boca I love your games. But some people argue the expense of them. When I bought this vacation game, I didn‚Äôt really like it. But then I thought something. Since I don‚Äôt have all the toca life games, I thought if you didn‚Äôt like a game, you could return it and get a different game for free. So it‚Äôs technically swapping out different games for the want you want and actually like. But, if you want to get more money, you can give all the gamers 1 return and they can purchase more. Thanks so much toca boca! I really appreciate it! :D But, it would be wonderful too if you delete a game that costs money, you can maybe get your money back? You don‚Äôt have to do that tho. Thanks again! :3"
"13231",1114893521,"Please add the flash"
"13232",1114893521,"When the notification says get 500 coins for playing, this is the 3rd or 4th time and I've open that notification and no coins were received. Don't lie to make me play a game."
"13233",1114893521,"It's co0l I guess"
"13234",1115010672,"The ad frequency is absolutely horrendous. You get through 30 seconds of puzzle work and are interrupted by a 25 second ad. They don‚Äôt even wait for you to complete the puzzle. It‚Äôs far from calming or relaxing.  The puzzles themselves are actually enjoyable, but it‚Äôs not worth the download until they limit the disruptions."
"13235",1115010672,"I‚Äôd pay some money for no ads. Let me know if that ever happens. Until then, uninstalled."
"13236",1115010672,"Beautiful and addictive!  Love it!"
"13237",1115022026,"I absolutely love this app! It really does work. However once your checks get to $200K it stays at $200K every single day thereafter even once you‚Äôve spent the entire check. The whole purpose of this app is to get the user into the mindset of receiving and spending large amounts of money. I would like to see the checks continue to grow with each day. Other than that this app is wonderful!"
"13238",1115022026,"I accepted update 2 days ago. Now nothing, and I mean nothing works   Where is the next update? It came within 2 days and helped a lot. It‚Äôs still slower than it was, and glitches sometimes.   But, overall I have to thank the developers for being very responsive and trying to get it working for everyone again.   I use this every morning and, who knows, maybe the universe is just telling me to slow down. üòé"
"13239",1115022026,"i‚Äôm only writing this review in hopes that the developer could help. my app was fine until i updated it yesterday. now i can‚Äôt use the decimal button when writing in my manifested money, and anything below $1 is shown as $0. would be great if i could get some answers thanks!"
"13240",1115245945,"Fun problem solving game. Really enjoyed."
"13241",1115245945,"It is very entertaining so far in Level 1."
"13242",1115245945,"Very cool game"
"13243",1115249449,"Mine seems to be crashing quite often resulting in me losing & there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. Aside from that, it‚Äôs pretty fun :)"
"13244",1115249449,"You‚Äôre gonna love this game. It never gets old. Plenty of content. Love that it‚Äôs timed and love that it‚Äôs a continuous challenge between opponents. I can literally play this game all night long!!!"
"13245",1115249449,"Why is the app having synchronization problems?! I can‚Äôt play at all!"
"13246",1115415865,"There‚Äôs an earthquake! Well I love this app. Bye!"
"13247",1115415865,"This is the first by Tinybop app I gotten and it is just amazing! There is nothing wrong with the game. I love your games so much. There are so much possibilities with the skyscrapers."
"13248",1115415865,"I thought this game would be fun after reading the reviews... After about 10 minutes I got super bored because you can do anything. üôÑ"
"13249",1115633942,"Ive played the first three games on my Iphone 4S. So that gives you an idea how successful these puzzles are. Each started out on its own before Memento, then they hid Gems in each of the levels (+ series). There‚Äôs also Red Portals that take you to a Secret timekeeper level in Memento.  One of the additions here in ZEN is: One way portal blocks which you come out of the direction the Gold ring sent you.  You can‚Äôt go back through a block however you can move it to a new place you want to send stuff in or teleport out of! The SWEET part lies in certain levels you can actually PUSH the block into the Gold Ring that creates & leads to a WORMHOLE level. Everything move you make there is now REVERSED!   If you never played any of the Quell series before, you can start with the original to see where the game gets better over time. So if you haven‚Äôt got the package of 4 - try Memento first.  The original might drive you a bit MAD as there‚Äôs less variety of puzzles there & more use of closing gates. However, both original & Reflect each have BONUS levels for extreme challenge too."
"13250",1115633942,"Dear Fallen Tree Game Makers, I love the Quell games so so much!!! Please consider adding the following updates to all Quell games: ability to reset apps to fresh, erase memory without erasing prior purchases, tips for how to solve/reach very tricky locations for gems and portals whether for purchase or through a link to a blog about the games and how they are designed. I love Quell games so much that I want to go Behind the Quell! I want to know the designers, what inspired their choices, the colors, the music, etc. Thank you so much for making these games for us to enjoy!!!"
"13251",1115633942,"The Quell series is a significant work of art on all levels. Compelling, comforting, challenging, inspiring.. I would love to have the option to move through chapters at the same level of difficulty as the first level, when I want a purely relaxing experience. As with Memento, I found some of the puzzles too complex to tackle. That said, I'm always looking forward to experiencing more Quell, and I'm grateful that I can turn to these gems that fill my heart."
"13252",1115647211,"It pastes like a big image it's not a real emoji"
"13253",1115647211,"The app is working great! The emojis are just right and they work better as stickers for iMessage. We can communicate better üëåüèªüëåüèªüôåüèª"
"13254",1115647211,"1. When you click the image it doesn't go into wherever you're typing like an emoji should  2. It just ""copies"" then image which, when pasted, is just a string of numbers.   Dev, please help me out or send me my $1 back."
"13255",1115681877,"Stupid app"
"13256",1115681877,"Don‚Äôt buy this app it is a complete scam!!!!!!!!!! It says to give it a five star rating but that was a lie!!!!!!!!!!!"

"13264",1116025351,"I love this game but I don't like how you unlock all the areas and then you don't have anything else to update. Also, I want you to add packages.You could put the food in the box and tape it up and then put it in the truck and drive it to a house or something.( but you could also just sell it at the market)  Also, you could add more food like corn, tomato soup where you smash the tomatoes and poor them in a can  I also think you should add an app.You could take a character and dress it up , give it a bath and put it to sleep and give it breakfast.And then in the morning you can take it to work as a farmer ."
"13265",1116025351,"Dr Panda is definitely a fun game for suitable for children as young as 3 -although some young children may need some assistance unlocking each of the different production areas.   Additionally, the app does offer a game environment which is supportive for a young child conceptual development of certain science and early math frameworks.   However, it is important to note, the ""core"" of the Dr Panda is that of entertainment and not of education.  This does not mean Dr Panda is not or could not be used in a constructive manner to promote learning.   Indeed, Dr Panda can be used to promote a child early understanding of addition and subtraction facts 0-5; especially when  a parent or other adult plays with the child and encourages he/she to think more deeply with questions/ statements such as: I see you have 2 customers wanting honey, but you can only make 5 jars of honey at a time. How many jars will you have left, after you give 2 jars to your customers.   This type of dialogue between caregiver and child will not only triple the boost to a child's educational skills; it will open the door for the child's understanding in many other cognitive domains.  Final Thoughts: Since gameplay throughout the farm requires precise fine motor skills - most beneficial for young children who are learning to write- I would encourage children to occasionally play this app using a stylus.   As these pre-writers work to twirl the windmill and place eggs in a carton, they will be developing the same muscles needed to write letters and words."
"13266",1116025351,"Omg dr panda games are one of my favorites and I'm 11. But I really wish there were more things to unlock. Like shearing sheep.or plowing the land and planting other seeds.Again I really like this game and you don't have to take my ideas, by the way my favorite selection is the jelly. Very creative pls make and update, byeüòç"
"13267",1116026071,"Hi I am 10 years old I just wanted to tell you how much fun I am having with this app !  I am new to this app and didn‚Äôt get this until  yesterday . But this has been the best app ever!!! I am loving this app so much that l am not playing with any of my others !! My favorite part about this app is that you have to unlock all the different buildings. Thank you for creating this app. It is the best !  Your Friend            Claire üòú"
"13268",1116026071,"This app is awesome. You can use it without WiFi which I love, and it has so many fun secrets. It is so cute and interesting, and has great animations. Perfect app"

"13270",1116027365,"Hi! Just as of right now there is a server unavailable glitch when I try to log in as a guest. If anyone can tell me how to solve this issue it would be great! Love your game and can‚Äôt wait to play it once again when this glitch is over."
"13271",1116027365,"Okay so, I‚Äôm not new to Mystic Messenger itself. I‚Äôve wanted to get it for a while now, and here we are. But I‚Äôve come across a very frustrating problem. I'm not sure if I just didn't catch the memo for this. Okay so, I accidentally fell asleep last night waiting for my phone to charge. I know the times of the chat rooms so, I paniced this morning figuring I'd just have to pay hour glasses to participate. I logged on and I'd already missed two chat rooms. But when I payed to participate it took the hourglass and didn't let me even look at the chat room. On top of that I can't open the one that's supposed to be the most recent chat room.   Help me T^T"
"13272",1116027365,"God . Finally , I know how to love :)"
"13273",1116112829,"Why do they all cost money! There is only 1 free one and I‚Äôm not allowed to spend money. So please in the next update make a couple free packs and get them for free by watching adds"
"13274",1116112829,"Cool concept but controls to customize the scenes are weak. Positioning capability of effect is very limited and the second part of the effects start before the shot scanges so there are timing issue there but overall it is a fun little gag tool but not useful for anything serious."

"13278",1116164772,"Not balanced and a bad game"
"13279",1116215882,"OK you can‚Äôt play as bubbles because she is the hacker and just because you‚Äôre a boy doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt watch the Powerpuff Girls"
"13280",1116215882,"Would be a favorite game if no adds please take them away and I will play"
"13281",1116215882,"I hate the ads, but it‚Äôs okay. I like the game. It‚Äôs fun, and not too hard.   It‚Äôs waaaay better than the PPG reboot show.   Miss the original PPG though.  Anyway, nice job with this game, CN.  Can you please add Courage the Cowardly Dog Games for the iOS? Also, other CN classic shows as games."
"13282",1116249582,"Lots of great puzzles and an interesting back story with beautiful graphics..."
"13283",1116249582,"Okay, so I like them a little creepy and this is just that‚Äîa little creepy. The story is fun, completely without fairies and magic, just a little paranormal with a helpful ghost. The puzzles are varied in both type and difficulty with more simple ones than brain busters. In all, a fun way to spend a rainy afternoon."
"13284",1116249582,"I really enjoyed this game and the storyline kept me engaged. My only wish is that it was longer."
"13285",1116253995,"I love all of the Dark Romance series"
"13286",1116253995,"Pretty good game!"
"13287",1116253995,"This game needs a little bit more of a challenge but since I dead to play two different roles it made the game even more fun. We need more games like this one!!...."
"13288",1116271098,"6/20/18  Playing this a second time in 2018 and the game is even better. All glitchy issues I had with it initially are gone. This is at present a very smooth, stunning game. Well done! ********** Whoa. A stunning mid-2016 game. It's a delight to encounter the new generation HOPs when they are like this one. At this writing, 5 excellent reviews stand before me, and I can't add one note to theirs other than to share my agreement, but mention one perturbing issue--an odd full screen error message pops up whenever I activate the hint button. It ends with stating ""Don't panic."" I plan to see if this can be corrected by rebooting my iPad 2. Hopefully, it's not a glitch that will affect others, but it's rather annoying to me. I'll edit my review if the error message disappears."
"13289",1116271098,"BORING! Not always sequential. A waste of time and money."
"13290",1116271098,"It's hard to know where to go next most of the time, & if it weren't for the hint button I couldn't get anywhere.  However, the mini games are pretty good.  Not the same ol' same ol'.  But I miss the diary which keeps you up on the backstory.  Big Fish is a good game maker, so I'll stick w/'em for a while longer!"
"13291",1116329647,"Its really fun but it gets harder so good luck if you get it I gave it three stars."

"13295",1116494563,"It's very addicting but if you hit anything it's game over."

"13299",1116536171,"I‚Äôm very impressed by the games graphics. It‚Äôs fun and life changing game to play. I definitely will be keeping this app forever. Splendid job creatorsüëçüèº"

"13310",1116785618,"I love it"
"13311",1116785618,"LOVE Piggy!  A real challenge!"
"13312",1116808304,"What a great game. Feels like Stranger Things meets Tron meets Halt and Catch Fire.  Just get it!  I couldn‚Äôt put it down, stayed up all night until I finished it. Worth every penny."
"13313",1116808304,"It‚Äôs very relaxing to play this interactive puzzle, moody, cyberpunk type, bit chaser game. Not sure if you could use just one word to describe it, so that was my feeble attempt.  One quick observation, the days seem to be wrong... maybe on purpose? For example, June 30th, 2359 is described as a Monday in-game, and Google tags it at Tuesday. Noticed that at the beginning date as well (can‚Äôt remember the specific day, but in-game date said Monday, calendar search had it as Tuesday). Haven‚Äôt gotten far enough, so maybe this will be explained later in the story?"
"13314",1116808304,"This, Frost, and Linelight are masterpieces. They‚Äôre never leaving my phone. Semidome, thank you for this gem. I only ask for more levels in the future but I know that‚Äôs a stretch. What‚Äôs here can be played over and over with great enjoyment. Support this amazing game, people!"
"13315",1116902833,"I love the app but since you guys updated the app it‚Äôs having issues starting up when I press the app I just get black screen and crash. Please fix it"
"13316",1116902833,"I updated the app and it keeps on crashing"
"13317",1116902833,"Every time I open the app it keeps crashing, it pops up on the unity logo turns black then crashes"
"13318",1116910957,"So I love this game, it‚Äôs amazingly addictive. However, one day, I ran out of hints, I tried to buy 5 more for $.99, but I never got the hints. I kept trying, but I got the same result. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great game!"
"13319",1116910957,"0 clues, told I could Restore. Could not. Was halfway through game. Have quit. Recommend no one buy clues!"
"13320",1116910957,"Update!  Make sure you exit the program and then restart.  Once the sync of your profile is there from the web, my character says ‚Äúinf‚Äù for clues.  Like others. Purchased unlimited clues. App says purchased. Never advanced from the initial 10 and keeps wanting to recharge me. Theft!"
"13321",1116980952,"This game is fun, and I would give it a higher rating were it not for the fact that a storm hits literally every five minutes in my game and damages a building every single time. As I type this I have 3 repairs ongoing and just finished a couple. Cut back on the damage, there can be storms that don‚Äôt damage your buildings."
"13322",1116980952,"Lots of fun, very addictive! I play in all my spare time!"
"13323",1116980952,"Without spending real $, can be alittle slow.  But a great game. Need constant attention or a storm will destroy what you have built."
"13324",1117166919,"I almost didn‚Äôt even buy this game. I was very wrong to second guess myself.   Restarts very quickly after you die. You learn from your mistakes and quickly see how the level can be beat. To be fair, most of the game I had fewer than 10 deaths per level. It jumped up in the second section to fewer than 20. In the final 25 levels, I averaged around 50, and even hit over 200 deaths on level 30 of the final section (each section has 41 levels). It gets really tough, but practice makes perfect. It makes it incredibly satisfying to beat. I probably won‚Äôt go back and play marathon mode, but it was easily worth the price."
"13325",1117166919,"This is a fantastic challenging game. I ask the devs to consider just one thing. Option to switch left and right tap controls. Some might might prefer the controls switched. I do. My right thumb would be better at maintaining the continuous tapping that would be required to fly while maintaining specific lift height. My left thumb doesn't have the stamina and loses control. Just a suggestion.   BTW The review claiming the game doesn't auto rotate is strange. The screen rotates just fine on my ipad and iPhone. It always flips immediately without lag every time."
"13326",1117166919,"Don‚Äôt waste your time and your money with this game"
"13327",1117310816,"It's quite a sassy little game and it's fun. Great graphics and they are nice and crisp with cute characters."

"13340",1117719909,"This app is pretty stupid it doesn‚Äôt look that‚Äôs really and it makes you just look really weird. If I‚Äôm being honest the quality could be a lot better. Overall Snapchat is a lot better."

"13348",1117998129,"Worth the pay!! It‚Äôs amazing how you‚Äôre able to see all the details of the human body and they‚Äôre all named as well!! Super cool. Especially for those who really need this app such as kinesiology majors!!"
"13349",1117998129,"What I was looking for"
"13350",1117998129,"This app is extremely helpful when studying Anatomy. With any book you are using to study you can always cross reference with this app and get a better understanding on where things are in the body. Well worth the money!"
"13351",1118072618,"Sounds very close to the original. The updated GUI makes editing way easier than the original and VST. Hopefully the VST version will get this interface eventually."
"13352",1118072618,"Love all the korg synth app products , was enjoying this one as well  till it stopped sending any audio out , I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it to no avail. Tried to look up any remedies online from Korg but nothing was there to help ."
"13353",1118072618,"I have been making the journey from analog to digital synths and in my foray into the land of FM Synthesis I discovered a little Korg box that nails that DX technology that in turn led me towards this incredible synth. This iWAVEStATION is a godsend!! Thanks, Korg, for bringing it back to us in this form. I hope to see the iM1 available for iPhone too."
"13354",1118082679,"This game is great. The insults are hilarious or ridiculous, and the controls work well. The only problem I have with this is that multiplayer just doesn‚Äôt work. I played with someone one time, and now, no matter how long I wait, there is no one available. That makes serious Sam and that other guy impossible to unlock! That‚Äôs not fair. I‚Äôll rate 4 stars because this game is addictive, but I‚Äôll only rate 5 if multiplayer is fixed.  Also, I wish there was DLC for the game so that you could get more characters or maps.  Thanks!"
"13355",1118082679,"I don‚Äôt know how to unlock the other things in the game, but I still love it!"
"13356",1118082679,"At first I thought this game was kid friendly but is actually inappropriate"

"13360",1118353232,"Question for dev - if my shield is blown up/lost on a level, is there still any way to defeat the immovable turtle, since hookshot only pulls me toward him?  Good game - thanks."
"13361",1118353232,"This is my favorite mobile game ever. It‚Äôs challenging and engaging and years after starting I still play it nearly every day. It‚Äôs incredibly difficult sometimes, but that also means it‚Äôs incredibly rewarding when you come to understand it. But even after you get really good at it, it never stops being a challenge. I love that there are no in-app purchases or ads. Just straightforward play."
"13362",1118353232,"Challenging tactics game with fun abilities, environmental use, and enemies that work together well. Each combination of enemy types creates a different challenge. Targeting controls are imprecise and the UI doesn't show targeting clearly, so it's easy to accidentally move or attack unintentional locations. Perhaps a target confirmation tap will fix the problem."
"13363",1118398079,"This game offers cross platform play, but won‚Äôt allow you to use the same account on Steam and iOS. Also is not full screen on my device. What a waste of money."
"13364",1118398079,"Don't waste your money!"
"13365",1118398079,"This game is a lot of fun but it refuses to let me log on, which is extremely frustrating when I'm trying to play it with friends."
"13366",1118406919,"Good"
"13367",1118406919,"Love the game but Not to happy with customer service at the moment. I‚Äôve been trying to contact you through the Wordalot app and your website but my emails are rejected as spam!  So silly as I‚Äôm not a business ...just trying to ask a question.  Wanting to know if when I purchase the no ads option with coins is it permanent or does it expire when the coins run out?  Does anyone know?"

"13371",1118431695,"cool game"
"13372",1118441024,"This game blasts me back to my childhood. Its so reminiscent of Bloons Super Monkey 1 and its got a great feel to it. I love that everything can be done without paying any real money. Its a fantastic game"
"13373",1118441024,"I got to ice map and defeated 4 bosses and got a epic weapon the catapult dart machine"
"13374",1118441024,"Compared to other apps this game has minimal ads and give you rewards that are pretty equal to effort. Not too time wasting. But being in the lower levels means things are most likely going to change!"
"13375",1118646945,"Just purchased for watch. Can‚Äôt open. $9.99 wasted."
"13376",1118646945,"I am not the only person who has been scammed by the developers of this app. If you make any in-app purchases, the features will NOT unlock. I did research on the app‚Äôs website and expected it to be trustworthy‚Äî it was well organized and informative. The website does NOT allow you to contact them. I have been TRYING to get a refund but apple support can‚Äôt help me and there is NO response from the developers."
"13377",1118646945,"I bought the premium package for a year & when it renewed the app never recognized my purchase, so I could not create new codes. Then support could not help me get back in - even after giving me a token for it. Now the app just crashes on my iPhone whenever I try to open it. Using LastPass now‚Äîwish I could get into PinGenie to pull out old passwords."
"13378",1118676232,"I accidentally got the game but I really don‚Äôt want it didn‚Äôt know it was money can you help me"

"13380",1118676232,"Hey MDickie! I‚Äôve been reviewing a few of your limited edition games and for this specific one I‚Äôve been thinking why there‚Äôs no wings for a Superhuman? Add Crimes, Money system and a outfit store for super humans by the bar"
"13381",1118756851,"Trash"
"13382",1118756851,"This game is fun and challenging. The hardest part is when you begin a game and an ad pops up that fills the entire screen. Then you have to push the tiny x before you die. Hardest level ever! (In case the sarcasm didn't come through, this is a problem. Please fix it.)"
"13383",1118756851,"This is a really cool game but you should be able to vs. your friends and their are too many ads popping up all of the time"
"13384",1118803687,"I enjoy playing this game a lot"
"13385",1118803687,"Best game ever! Entertaining!"
"13386",1118803687,"Cute graphics"
"13387",1118844179,"Yeah I love your this app!"
"13388",1118844179,"Probably the worst game on the App Store. The game always glitches and freezes. It‚Äôs not fun, there‚Äôs too many ads, there‚Äôs no point to the game, and it‚Äôs just so repetitive. You end up doing the lame boring things over and over again with no real goal. The developer so be ashamed for their self for making such an awful game, and should stop developing apps all together. There‚Äôs a reason why no one has ever heard of this game and it should stay that way."
"13389",1118844179,"Trash game, trash graphics"
"13390",1118878857,"So I loved this game and I was good at it but I hadn‚Äôt played in years due to personal reasons. So I though ‚ÄúWhy not try it out‚Äù And a thingy showed up and I read it...IT WANTS MY DEVICES LOCATION??? Ok so um...yeah no...I‚Äôm not giving my devices information, my devices location, or any other shenanigans...sorry but no...It‚Äôs not happening. Pleaseee help meeeee!"
"13391",1118878857,"Not competitive if everyone can get a box, plus sliding is dumb and that slam is dumb"
"13392",1118878857,"I love this game this game is so much fun it helps me com down and more but I just wanna say thank YOU!!"
"13393",1119002115,"I found out about this app about three hours ago and I was fascinated I had to try it and it has been great thanks guys you‚Äôre doing a wonderful job"
"13394",1119002115,"Content is very basic."
"13395",1119002115,"The previous version was much better. It was much more linear and you can track your progress easily. This version lost linearity and let you just jump right into any sort of training, and broke a lot of its appeal in doing so. If you do follow it, the app does help you to an extent, each person will have a different experience. I have had more success with the previous version than I did with this one. Also, upgrading logs you out and they didn't happen to save my progress from the original which was off putting. The latest update is broken too where the keyboard doesn't go away/no enter key, and progress sometimes doesn't record. This version makes you play the doctors videos every time you start training, you can skip it, but in the previous version, the app already knows you've watched it. You would think that after all of the media attention this app got, that they would improve the app, not make it worse."
"13396",1119003636,"Don‚Äôt bother. Too expensive for very little."
"13397",1119003636,"I love this app it‚Äôs soo cool and you can text with itüòãüòÜüòÅüòÑüòÉüòÄ"
"13398",1119003636,"I have an iPhone 6s and I go in the app and than I pick my gender than it crashes and goes to the home page I tried everything and it still won‚Äôt work it looks like so music fun but I can access it."
"13399",1119104329,"Paid for this app yesterday and it has been crashing.  We shut the iPad off and restart the game, only to have it crash moments later. I want a refund!"
"13400",1119104329,"I never tried this game but it looks so fun!(a six year old did this)!"
"13401",1119104329,"My kids love it. Very good for spatial orientation"
"13402",1119132775,"The app requires way too much stability in order to accurately measure between surfaces or points. For example, I tried it in my office, measuring from table top to floor. I got significantly different measurements each time and was told I moved the phone too much. I was simply setting the phone on the floor, picking it up, then setting it on the desk top. Naturally, the phone moved and rotated a bit in the act of picking it up and setting it down. I am not sure I could have been more precise in my movements, but apparently the app requires it.   If I scale this activity up for measuring a building, I would not be able to maintain anywhere near this level of precision and stillness. I do not move like a laser. When measuring a space, I have to walk across a room, or many rooms. I  cannot be expected to not tilt, rotate, or otherwise shift my phone as I move from one point to the next. Often times there are pieces of furniture or other objects in the way.   I think the app requires conditions that are too ideal, and for that reason the measurements cannot be trusted. My work requires very accurate measurements.  I think I‚Äôll stick with my laser. It has not let me down except in sunny outdoor settings."
"13403",1119132775,"I have a iPhone 6 and now since the recent update none of the measurements work"
"13404",1119132775,"Very nice app and easy to use. Very useful. Thanks"
"13405",1119322616,"This is hella cathartic"
"13406",1119322616,"I played the original Auralux & when I got the new iPhone the game wasn‚Äôt able to be played. Huge surprise to find that this game has become even better than it was. Absolutely in love with it"
"13407",1119322616,"The game is very addictive, a good time passer. So far I have no complaints would recommend it to anyone"
"13408",1119358760,"Another great game from this dev.  Difficulty was just right, but you need a good ear for this music themed game.  There are two endings, the game plays well, no glitches, has a Save option, and ads are not intrusive.  Hope to see more from this dev soon.. Thank you!"

There are levels that are IMPOSSIBLE to solve w/o extra moves...you‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm willing to pay for it...most would not but I really enjoy this game when it works.  There are several levels with scoring errors and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve not found all the issues. Please either fix it or take it down because going thru the App Store for refunds stinks!  They were great, but couldn‚Äôt fix your game!"

"13419",1119482395,"I love this game so much! I mostly play it when I do not have WiFi on my iPad. I love how you can fix many different peoples hair, and style them however you want. But sometimes it could get a little boring, because there is no challenge. My suggestion is for there to make the customers ask for a specific hairstyle and outfit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è great game tho! I still like this game. But if the creators can work on this, that would be great. üôÇ"
"13420",1119569595,"I‚Äôve had this game on my phone for a few years now and have never even thought about taking it off. Sometimes I will go through phases where I don‚Äôt play it at all for months but then I‚Äôll go back to it and enjoy it just as much as the first time. It‚Äôs tricky, challenging, fun and the humor is also on ball. Well done guys! I love this game!"
"13421",1119569595,"I love this game, is so fun and addicting. I spent 5 dollars or so and then got all the characters easily. Then it got boring and I was just waiting for an update. So I deleted it. I downloaded today to find all my progress gone and all my purchases not in game so either fix this or give me a refund because now my 5 dollars is just useless."
"13422",1119569595,"Title. Very very well polished game and unrelenting. Give it a shot."
"13423",1119644926,"Simply amazing!"
"13424",1119644926,"Enjoy this because things that take you away this much are rare and hard to find.   For readers of science fiction who love space operas, this is an unbelievably rich, grippingly-paced, can't-put-down story / RPG. The music and atmosphere are explosively enveloping - use headphones.   I've enjoyed this more than any movie, sci-fi novel, game, or TV show I've come across in the last year.   Can't wait til episode 3."
"13425",1119644926,"This is not really a game or a choose your adventure, it‚Äôs a graphic novel where you can make mistakes and have to start over from a checkpoint. I had hoped it was a blend of that and ‚ÄúOut There‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs very linear, and there aren‚Äôt really any twists, just false choices. Make the wrong choice? You die, go back to checkpoint. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúdecisions that matter‚Äù that just black and white decisions.  That said, art and music are 5 stars. The story is pretty cool and paints a gorgeously creative picture of experiencing an alien universe, but again the linearity combined with the shortness does make the experience a bit underwhelming. But perhaps that‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs so creative and awesome, that I want more. I wish I could bring the universe it creates to any of a number of sci-fi games with real gameplay but lackluster story and characters.  I‚Äôm off to play the 5-star ‚ÄúOut There‚Äù by this same studio, buy that, it‚Äôs worth every penny!"
"13426",1119713595,"This is a really good game with multiple endings. My only real complaint is that there are too many useless items and red herrings in the game."
"13427",1119713595,"Once again an incredible story, great puzzles, and lots of heart and humor. Just waiting for the next WadjetEye game now that I‚Äôve finally played ALL of them!"
"13428",1119713595,"Great game"
"13429",1119856566,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this game but I started to lose data like characters and story data and I am really confused because it was a update the all of a sudden I‚Äôm replying the first mission so plz fix the problem I miss all my good characters"
"13430",1119856566,"As a veteran Blazing player. Have been playing since the beginning of time. This game started out great and the grind was fun and enjoyable. But the main attraction was PvP. Ever since this anniversary they have ruined the game. Imagine waiting almost an entire year for a banner to come out. And you spent a years worth of pearls for the 2 supposedly ground breaking units after fv naruto and sasuke. And then they release a banner right after anniversary and it decimated the game. At this point the game is dying. They have yet to release a new banner where you can actually grind on to get pearls on. Or updated story mode to get any pearls from. So for any veteran players it‚Äôs almost impossible to even get any pearls to summon on any banner. And for PvP sake. It has totally been ruined by 2 units. The whole point is to strategize and defeat your opponent. But not when 2 units literally make it unplayable. New body naruto literally removes 2 chakra and ignores everything possible and switch seals for 4 turns. In PvP standpoint (4 turns is the whole entire game) you can‚Äôt do anything about that and if you were to try to build a team around that. The units that can even do that are substantially weaker and slower so there‚Äôs no point in even running them. It literally shows you how bad the game is now when new players could‚Äôve hopped on and summoned for the new naruto and sasuke and make it to S10 kage league when veteran players struggled without those 2 units. The game used to be fun due to PvP and PvE but one of them is no longer enjoyable and another you can‚Äôt even play when you‚Äôve already done it. Also the GUI of this game is trash, the loading times for everything is trash, buying items are 1 by 1, and you load in and out of everything you do. Gree you really are a trash company, you did the same thing to brave frontier."
"13431",1119856566,"I don‚Äôt have any idea what is wrong with this game I‚Äôm almost rank 150 and all of a sudden my game won‚Äôt load past 70% I  don‚Äôt want to uninstall and reinstall just to loose my data l"

"13433",1120072154,"This game is good"
"13434",1120072154,"This app is the worst!!!!!! I hate it. You have to buy the all the tools just to play"
"13435",1120181386,"Fun and innovative puzzle concept, well-polished, difficulty level builds up at appropriate place, sense of achievement after completing every level with 3 stars...also thank you for GC Achievements."
"13436",1120181386,"Good game. Make you think"
"13437",1120181386,"This is a great game and fun to play with all my favorite game and I love this game play it a lot and I love it so much"
"13438",1120294802,"Everything else seems the same as before. Raid cards seem pretty cool until you can only use them once per entire round of the guild raid bosses. So if you‚Äôre only sitting on three, and you use all three in one attack, you‚Äôve screwed yourself out of attacking anymore until the ridiculous time limit on waiting for a raid boss and actually being able to attack NEXT round. Can‚Äôt really say anything else about it since I can‚Äôt do anything else because of that rule on the cards. Would have been an awesome update other than that."
"13439",1120294802,"Very fun game I enjoy clicker games and it‚Äôs very easy to level up and I think it is perfect in every possible way nothing wrong also no ads unless you choose to watch them which is pretty nice awesome game great graphics very fun."
"13440",1120294802,"No idea what the challenge is supposed to be in this game.  No strategy at all just tap the screen."
"13441",1120339123,"Great graphics. No glitches. Good story. Could've used more hidden object scenes. But I enjoyed it."
"13442",1120339123,"Game won‚Äôt load after playing it for a while, turning it off and then going back to it. When you hit continue to game, the screen just turns and stays black."
"13443",1120339123,"Will not load!!!!!"
"13444",1120437406,"This is a great game but could you add more cubes because I have all of them"
"13445",1120437406,"cool game, cute characters.  also...what does the u.s. iTunes app store have against system optimizer apps, system memory refreshing apps, & battery boosting apps?  seriously!  every time i find one that does it all, inevitably the app store phases it out.  these types of utilities are readily available in every other store, but not in the u.s. store. it's as though apple doesn't want it's customers to be able to enjoy the benefits of this type of utility, and they don't have the right to decide that for their customers. (and yet they have done just that) hasn't anyone out there noticed this?  i cannot be the only person."
"13446",1120437406,"This game gets more addicting the the more you play,and the graphics are stunningly beautiful,I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new addictive game to play."

"13459",1120861209,"Slide puzzle plus rogue plus dating sim? Fun time"
"13460",1120861209,"While this is a lovely little puzzle game, with an interesting system to figure out, I leave it three stars only because the story and situation are so depressing I simply couldn‚Äôt play it anymore. What a downer this game is! However, if you love the idea of repeating a cycle of failure in which you are just never good enough, life isn‚Äôt fair, and you find yourself always leaving some sweet children to die in the woods in the cold, surrounded by monsters and witches, because you‚Äôre just not up to the task, well, have a great time."
"13461",1120861209,"I get the feeling that I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, but I sure do enjoy this game!"
"13462",1120991202,"Too many ads kill this game. For the first 10 minutes I thought it was more than a decent game, til the ads started popping up. Now I‚Äôm dealing with ads that are popping up less than a min apart from one another."
"13463",1120991202,"To many ads in this game. Not very challenging and  pay for items in the middle of play field easy to accidentally tap"
"13464",1120991202,"It‚Äôs a decent  game but the ads gets annoying after few rounds . Should fix that at least other than that it‚Äôs"
"13465",1121157685,"It is a ok game .   Not my favorite but I do play it"
"13466",1121157685,"These new challenges are great, different! Most of the games could make some upgrades which would really enhance the playing.  For a change I would like games with more animals. Great challenges now.I love the new games! Good payouts but they are few and far between. The new games are more interesting and more fun. Looking forward to summer games and then holiday ones!when are the 4th of July games coming out ? They are fantastic still looking for July 4 games. They‚Äôre are fun and challenging. Can hardly wait to see the holiday games"

There are just the shapes of the dogs and cats in the movie, nothing else. There‚Äôs not even a dark brown eye option. I don‚Äôt like how the options are so limited. This app is not what I wanted for my little dogs."
"13486",1121782467,"From the graphics to the sound design this game just oozes quality.... beautiful and relaxing, highly recommended"
"13487",1121782467,"This game is so frustrating and will need to watch or read a walkthrough to finish the game."
"13488",1121782467,"This game is beautiful. I have played all of the Samorost games since I was about 6 years old. I was so excited when I found this one. I love the lack of instructions. They just set you off. People that speak any language could play this. There is no element of being rushed, so you can take your time in all that you do in the game. Not to mention the story, which  is great!!  Overall, I love this game. Well worth the 6 dollars that I spent!"
"13489",1121910644,"I tried to park but I can't turn"

"13492",1121943475,"I love that this app gives me the ability to set my borders exactly how I want them. Wonderful app, and its extremely easy to use. I definitely give this five stars."
"13493",1121943475,"It‚Äôs an OK collage app.  All I found I could do is add filters and adjust borders.  I guess everything else must be locked behind a subscription (not worth it!).  I‚Äôm writing this review sideways on my iPad Pro, since the app is in portrait mode only.  I‚Äôd say it's average‚Äîhence, 3 stars."

"13497",1121963448,"This game is beautifully done.  I love puzzle games that are also visually stimulating. Add to that the amazing, relaxing music and you can't go wrong! Well worth the money. I'd pay for any game these folks put out based on how well this one alone was made."
"13498",1121971067,"Why do you offer us to watch videos to get free coins and have no videos available causing people to lose out on 1000 free coins and then, still not have videos to watch Tibet the other free coins. You shouldn‚Äôt have to close the app and reopen it each time just to watch a video.  And fix the other stuff as other reviewers have said!  What the F is wrong with you people that you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt fix anything? You allow us to watch videos to get free coins but more often then not, even more so lately, there‚Äôs no videos/you get the message, no videos. And when it‚Äôs to get the $1,000 coins after the free $500 coins when there‚Äôs no video you lose being able to get it if/when you close it.   Why do you bother to f‚Äôing offer free coins for watching videos if you‚Äôre not going to have videos/if there‚Äôs no videos to watch!!!"
"13499",1121971067,"I have enjoyed playing this game but lately there have been major glitches which need to be addressed.  Connection issues where it reads waiting for opponent to connect, yet I miss a turn because opponent‚Äôs internet connection is poor. Combined with playing Bingo and I hit my target and it‚Äôs registered as a miss. Yet when I hit it for a second time, the first arrow is still there. Fix this please. What should be a fun game is turning into a glitchy mess."
"13500",1121971067,"This game is actually fun when it loads, which takes me opening and closing the app two or three times. Takes forever to finally get into the actual game. Other than that, it‚Äôs a really fun game."
"13501",1122211704,"This is an amazing puzzle game and I‚Äôve almost gotten all the endings but I‚Äôve had trouble with the green button panel.

"13504",1122212503,"This game was a lot of fun. Thanks!"
"13505",1122212503,"I have played dozens of these games and this one is very good in comparison. I like the puzzle piece collectibles and the morphing objects, they are tricky at times in this game. As are the mini games but I like a challenge. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I only do casual mode but I still like the thought that goes into making the game tricky. You have to go back to scenes many times to use different objects to open things so that gets a little repetitive but so far so good."
"13506",1122212503,"Don‚Äôt buy this for use on iPad. Mine froze during second chapter. I had many discussions with Big Fish and tried all their fixes. Eventually they agreed the game doesn‚Äôt work well on iPads. They couldn‚Äôt refund my money because I got it through App Store."
"13507",1122439453,"The app is really confusing if you‚Äôre not used to their custom UI, The very first few races, the brake button was covered with ads, The steering is very odd and turns veryyyy weird. Uninstalling"
"13508",1122439453,"I love the game but when I finish a level, it covers the content on the bottom and I can't press next."
"13509",1122439453,"They make all the target times impossible because other traffic goes a slow as they can"
"13510",1122444037,"It‚Äôs fun up until you get into the higher levels then the game will literally not allow you to progress. The colors will not fall to be able to match more than 2 or 3 so you literally waste your moves unless you use boosters which cost money. Absolutely ridiculous, games are supposed to be about having fun not having a cooperation make money and ruin your enjoyment. You already profit from the commercials you make us watch now at least let us progress and have fun with a game! Deleting right now."
"13511",1122444037,"Fun game but with the new update it doesn‚Äôt work at. When I touch the screen to play nothing happens. Everything in the background still moves though"
"13512",1122444037,"I love playing this game on my down time but it‚Äôs recently has been crashing whenever I purchase blasts with my silver coins before entering a level. It forces u to restart the app and you end up loosing a life and coins. It‚Äôs also has been releasing less levels lately on Wednesday. Which def blows so I end up beating basically all the new levels and then having to wait 3-4 days for new ones. Only to have like 6 new levels üôÑ really irritating."
"13513",1122498143,"i don‚Äôt like many games but this one is nice and i can see myself playing it for a while"
"13514",1122498143,"I deleted the game but then it says that I still had it and no matter what I try it won‚Äôt go away! I checked the App Store and it said I still had it but when I click open it does nothing! FIX! THIS! NOW! PLEASEEE"
"13515",1122498143,"It‚Äôs a great game I love how there is a little bit of music after each level but the music gets better after each level."
"13516",1122621497,"Please put a feedback email where you can suggest emoji‚Äôs such as Diallo"
"13517",1122621497,"This is the hugest piece of crap I have ever download! Sorry just my Review. Expecting what was advertised, but I will never be tricked again! Don‚Äôt download? Please! Trust me!"
"13518",1122621497,"You have to copy & paste, however, the ‚Äúemojis‚Äù are pasting as large size photos. These are not emojis. Not what I was looking for."
"13519",1122649984,"Has some of the best filters I have seen around in the appstore"
"13520",1122649984,"It‚Äôs fast easy and it‚Äôs great  Love it"
"13521",1122649984,"Fun app to experiment with.  Such beautiful colors and visual transformation of my artwork.  I love it!"
"13522",1122682633,"This was a great game when you could shout the music off whilst keeping the sound effects turned on. At least that‚Äôs how I remembered it used to be. Then my iPad mini died and I couldn‚Äôt play this for about a year. Now I have a new iPad and you can‚Äôt shut the music off without totally muting all sound in the game. Fix this alone and I‚Äôll be more than happy to reinstall and give it five stars. The music is a deal breaker."
"13523",1122682633,"Pack 2 level 24 needs to be fixed, should be 48 moves, not 44. Other levels are like this as well"
"13524",1122682633,"Really awesome puzzle game"
"13525",1122904897,"Never loads"
"13526",1122904897,"The emojis are so cool. But after I hit the sticker it says copied but it won‚Äôt paste."
"13527",1122904897,"I just wish they‚Äôd add more shade mojis but they never do"
"13528",1122909751,"This game is so much fun. And the characters look so cool! But I liked the game back before version 1.2 when there were levels to play through that were challenging. Endless runner is fun but can get a little boring and sometimes starts feeling repetitive. The game was changed so much between then and now that they might as well have made a new app and left the levels for those who liked it. Or maybe leave the option to switch between different game modes. That would be the best of both worlds!"
"13529",1122909751,"Super funny!!!!!!!!!!!"
"13530",1122909751,"I love this game and I believe a lot of people would join and play this game again, plz bring back the old one, online game and compete with other players . No one wants to play an offline game."
"13531",1123042939,"Need wind feature again."
"13532",1123042939,"Needs more players, connection is bad, my progress get deleted mid-week, the cost of a speed or strength upgrade gets so expensive, can I see my all-time best throw somewhere?"
"13533",1123042939,"Fun little time passer. Hard to master."
"13534",1123078102,"It seems like I am constantly kicked out of the article I‚Äôm reading and regularly have to delete and reload it so I can read the content I‚Äôm interested in. Love the stories. The use of the app leaves a lot to be desired."
"13535",1123078102,"Great app but never quit adding leagues.  More options is always better.  NBC has PLL so why not add that here. More soccer leagues, including international soccer"

"13553",1123605369,"I‚Äôll just preface this by saying I‚Äôve never wrote a review for an app before, but I enjoy playing this game so much that I want to share some of my thoughts. So first off, this game is awesome. It‚Äôs a new concept to me and is challenging and really fun. However, I‚Äôve noticed that once you get to the 50‚Äôs 60‚Äôs 70‚Äôs etc the game gets slightly stale. After 10 you get the addition of the short ladder and fire, at 20 you get the conveyer belt and a bit further you get the ghost on the conveyer belt. ...And that‚Äôs it. There is no more new content (at least that I‚Äôm aware of) after that. That, I think is where the game falls short. After the 30‚Äôs the levels become the same and blend together. I think that this game could very much benefit from adding more to the higher levels. This would allow new players to have the same semi-challenging environment while giving the more experienced players newer challenges and more to overcome."
"13554",1123605369,"This game is simple in terms of controls, but is challenging and rewarding. I played this with some friends, and we competed for a high score."

There's no contact email and the card says there are no replacement codes, so o guess I'm just bones now? Decent program when it works, but garbage back-end.

"13593",1124221308,"A good game, but not a great game.  Many HOP's are the same scene used over again, a sign of a lazy crew.  Music did not always fit the mood of the scene.  The Bells were a nice touch, but several were hidden behind other objects, and so tiny any player with a few years in their plate would need a magnifying glass to get them all.  One was hidden at the upper corner nearly behind the ""X"".  The plot was a little thin, and lagged in a few places.  However, even with all of these little negatives, I give it a 3+ (4), because it has rapid transfer from scene to scene, and a nice hop to the needed location."

"13651",1126101226,"While I am glad many have found this app helpful, I don‚Äôt feel like the timing and nature of the messages is intuitive to what I‚Äôm thinking, feeling, or needing at that moment.  For example, one message read ‚ÄúThe song you are hearing right now has been sent by God‚Äù- well, I was in a restroom stall with absolutely no music playing anywhere at the time. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, when I go to the app to read the message sent by AAM, I can continually scroll through unlimited messages, and not just the one that was sent to me at that hour.  I really wanted to like this app, but it feels inauthentic, and the fact that I can scroll through unlimited messages that are supposed to be meted out to me at the right times by a higher power tells me something here is deeply flawed.  My recommendation: skip this app and save your hard earned money."

I‚Äôm confused arnt I only supposed to get one message if I select one message daily? If I keep hitting the arrow I keep getting new messages do I just have to not hit the arrow again? Or is there a way to make it so only one message comes up at a time. Theres no more explanation as to how the app works in the description so I thought id ask here.  Thanks"

"13655",1126212440,"I have bought this game for $3 and I believe it was well worth the price and lived up to expectations fully. However I can‚Äôt feel like there was a lot of potential lost here. The simplicity of this game is what makes it initially love able to play but it gets boring real quick. The way to beat every level is the same. No matter what you‚Äôre up against it takes to brain power to figure out how to properly deal with it, but I must express how empty this game feels with its lack of enemy/unit variety. There are two summonable soldiers and the enemy can use them as well, as far as I can tell your ‚Äúwar tree‚Äù summons the different types randomly. That‚Äôs the one aspect of this game that is appealing and a pleasure to play with. It is for that reason that I take away a star because this game is so simple and yet so much potential is lost because of a lack of variety in anything. New units, perhaps new trees that summon specific units or you choose what your war tree produces when you plant it, would bring this game to life and an open up a new variety of strategies that the player would have to utilize to potentially deal with the new challenges that more unit variety would bring. Given this game is so simple and the A I are direct, it is obvious playing this game adding a new unit would take minimal effort and vastly improve the quality of gameplay and replay ability especially when you factor in the procedural generation this game could easily have."

"13663",1126394027,"I‚Äôve been playing this game for almost a year now. It was fun for a while, but slowly became annoying. First of all, I hate how taking your turn costs money. Like, I know it‚Äôs supposed to be a strategy game, but seriously? I mean, are you kidding? I‚Äôve gone bankrupt in 4 turns. AFTER buying. No lie. Make the per turn cost 20 dollars, OR DON‚ÄôT HAVE ONE. Your own earnings are too little, and the small amount you get from the praise and stuff  is pathetic. You spend all of it when it comes to the conspiracies anyway. Second of all, as I said in the title, the decision making results make 0 sense. Say you prevent the mafia from taking over businesses. Why should the common man, opposition, and oligarchies be mad? They are the ones who it affects. This makes the game nigh unplayable. Or why should stricter security screenings make the police and army mad. Occasionally the ups and downs are random. It‚Äôs kind of annoying how no faction can stay neutral. Why should the mafia, army, opposition and oligarchies care if I give the cops more donuts? You have to do what one faction wants, and I get that‚Äôs the point, but make it logical. Why would the police be mad about me cracking down on crime? Why would the police be happy i let the Mafia steal their cars? It‚Äôs so annoying to think you made a good decision, only to find out the faction you wanted to benefit seemed to like something being against them. And the conspiracies are worse. Sometimes you need to pick between two decisions that would be considered conspiracies against you, and the one that costs money is the one that makes the crowd happy. Like what? Me raising an army general‚Äôs salary because he was incompetent makes everyone happy, but firing him doesn‚Äôt? It‚Äôs so stupid, and as I said, YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE OF THE COST PER TURN. All in all, if the developer made the decisions more logical, and made the cost per turn a LOT less, then I would play it, and love it because the concept is wonderful."
"13664",1126394027,"There is a bug where I cannot leave the treasury screen and I have to restart all the progress I‚Äôve made please fix"
"13665",1126394027,"There is an error that when i enter it stays only in the money room"
"13666",1126403961,"The kids love this game, but the sound stopped working on it while other apps still worked. I discovered that the mute was set in the screen when you swipe up from the bottom of the iPad. I turned off the mute, and the app works just fine."
"13667",1126403961,"The sound doesn't work. Hard to play the games without instruction. Waste of money."

"13672",1126517945,"Dear Developers, I myself am starting to learn to programming and I can tell that your pretty good at what you do. You definitely listen to your fans and their ideas so just wanna say, good job, you make great games, and thank you for listening to my and many other peoples reviews!  #GreatGames! #5‚≠êÔ∏è's! #LoveYourGames! #EducationalAndFun! #ThanksForListening! #‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è   -probably/hopefully everyone in the comments:) (At least meüòÖ) You deserve it!

"13673",1126517945,"This game is fantastic! It is perfect for kids who want to learn about space. And the activities are so fun! It even gives you a look at the size and weight of the planets.üåèüåõ And, you get to make your own rocket ship! The best part is that you get to look inside the planets."

"13678",1126563858,"Would like to see the game updated for today‚Äôs ios and what not. Um really wish that when you enter a floor and when you die you can start at that floor instead of doing the previous floor first before getting to the floor you were on. Kinda redundant to do that since the floor is a checkpoint since when you continue even at the boss stage you must start again at the beginning of the floor.   Also would like to see is a progress meter so we can know how long til the end"
"13679",1126563858,"Loving this game and I already put a few people on this game"
"13680",1126563858,"My new favorite game! One suggestion: you should DODGE the shuriken instead of blocking them. You would need to press the opposite direction to dodge instead of block. This would throw a curve in your muscle memory and reflexes while playing."
"13681",1126585243,"üòÅ fun addicted and helps pass time"
"13682",1126585243,"It won‚Äôt open on my iPhone 6S Plus am upset! Fix please."

"13688",1126723825,"I love the gameplay it's probably the best game I've played in a while"
"13689",1126723825,"Really, if you like twitch games, it‚Äôs just about best of class. For everyone complaining about ads, I have a solution: pay to unlock. Don‚Äôt be stingy with greatness, it‚Äôs only a dollar or two."
"13690",1126769121,"I love this game but filling the gas takes way to long. I was waiting for like over 2 mins so I have to restart the game."

"13695",1126845799,"Love this synth. Just wish the volume was a bit higher. It tends to run lower volume than my other moog synth apps."
"13696",1126845803,"No matter what you do the audio clips and crackles"
"13697",1126845803,"Audio crackles no matter what you do. Electro-Harmonix, please give this app the patch fix it deserves. This app is the only way I will likely ever be able to use the iconic Mini-Synthesizer in my lifetime. Please help us out with a solution!"
"13698",1126845803,"I really want to like this app, but there are some audio engine issues on my iPhone 6s - lots of high frequency crackles on all of the presets make it unusable for anything serious, and unpleasant for anything playful."
"13699",1126932090,"Seems to try and load a virus or ad every time I even try and open the app. Avoid at all costs!"
"13700",1126932090,"It's a nice fun way to get your brain and hands working"
"13701",1126932090,"Uncreative and overly hard."
"13702",1126935885,"I played the first two games when they came out for free, and when then I waited hoping the third to be free as well, but oh well I love playing them because they're a choose your own adventure stories almost"
"13703",1126935885,"I went over the four apps in my review of the first book, I‚Äôll just add a few things. This is even more complex, tricky and fun than the previous work. Having the rewind feature disabled is a questionable choice. I understand it is frustrating. I would have given the choice to the player, between perhaps a beginner/weakling mode where rewinding is still possible and the full adventure as it is now. Or by giving the player the incentive to give up the rewinding. Or by giving a limited number of rewinds, etc. In the game books, after all, whether the rules forbade it or not, you coud always go back to the previous chapter or to the previous intersection. If you put that reservation aside, the app is again one of the best games out there and the whole series deserves high praise and success."
"13704",1126935885,"I agree with another reviewer, make it an option to not have, but don‚Äôt make this great series of games into a frustrating ordeal. Please, please bring the rewind function back for this game!"
"13705",1127108818,"I think that we should be able to buy fifa points through the companion app. And the bugs should be fixed"

"13714",1127726827,"We purchased this game and made sure our volume is working, reinstalled it and there is no sound..."
"13715",1127726827,"My son is in the spectrum. And he does this game like it‚Äôs second nature. Great. Love it"
"13716",1127726827,"My little girl loves this game. She was so happy to have new levels. Keep up the good work. Only thing I‚Äôd change is the music lol it puts me to sleep but she likes it."
"13717",1127910488,"Here is another free app that I like. When I compare the pictures it takes to the ones taken with the camera app that comes with iOS, the ones taken with this app seem better exposed and color balance. The disadvantage is, it requires a lot of processing so on my old iPhone 5s, it took a while but on my SE and iPhone 7, it takes significantly less time."
"13718",1127910488,"sometimes it makes sound when i shot"
"13719",1127910488,"only gets 4 out 5 for 2 reasons - one it crashes frequently on ios 12.1 and the uploader only lets you choose from your local photo library to enhance a previously taken photo"
"13720",1127930385,"If you use it right then it will turn out great."
"13721",1127930385,"I changed mobile carriers and had to upgrade my phone in order to switch. Went from Samsung 7 to Apple Xr (just due to sale and cost) and this Verizon app made it very easy to transfer photos and contacts. What didn‚Äôt transfer were my Android apps‚Äîsome had Apple versions but my actual (paid) Android apps didn‚Äôt transfer. Will unfortunately have to research what to do about those on my own."
"13722",1127930385,"I have used this app two times now. It has made transferring phones extremely accessible and easy without having to call Verizon or go to the store like I have had to do in the past. The app works quickly, smoothly, and the directions are simple to follow."
"13723",1127933116,"This game makes me feel like a DJ"
"13724",1127933116,"Hoping the levels will become more challenging!"
"13725",1127933116,"The game is a bit challenging and has a lurking curve but it‚Äôs also a good puzzle experience and makes beautiful shapes"
"13726",1128070374,"Neat little game. I would pay to not have to watch the ads (which are for games that look very stupid) after dying just to get back to the home screen. This is a real black eye on an otherwise promising game. Makes me not want to play it."
"13727",1128070374,"I really like this game. It‚Äôs super simple and yet super fun! I would definitely recommend."
"13728",1128070374,"I love this game. I love that it's free. I play Dungeons and Dragons- Like the pen and paper version- and this reminds me so much of it. I recommend this to anyone who loves dungeon crawlers!"
"13729",1128311260,"This app is okay, but I was looking for something more. I‚Äôm interested in making room and body sprays but this app didn‚Äôt have those recipes. I may find a use for this app in the future though."
"13730",1128311260,"I downloaded this today but it does not have the features I need. How can I get a refund?"
"13731",1128311260,"It‚Äôs my go to app for all essential oil. I use it all the time. The recipes are wonderful and have made many of them. I use this app when looking for an oil as it is easier to use them looking it up on YL website. When I receive my ER order I go in and update my inventory right away. Helps me keep track of my oils."
"13732",1128326130,"I've finished a few other Kairo games and this one was a let down. I think I'm about halfway through and the game has stopped doing anything new. I don't think I'll finish it."
"13733",1128326130,"It's a great game. The only problem was the last update. It wiped my save I'm upset but I'm not going to write a one star review on something that might not have been the devs fault. Other than that it's a four star game but -1 star for wiped save"
"13734",1128326130,"worst Karo game ever"
"13735",1128623591,"I found Dr Oz stress plan but can‚Äôt use it what am I doing wrong?"
"13736",1128623591,"Like the new design! Easier to read and find content"
"13737",1128623591,"Your nervous system is divided into two sections; The autonomic, which is responsible for uncontrollable movements. While your somatic is the viceversa of the autonomic.  Your brain cannot fix anything if you do not put in effort to sustain your life."
"13738",1128801236,"I‚Äôve beaten this game twice, yet I still come back and download it again. This game is a blast and the creators should be proud of this game. Five stars."
"13739",1128801236,"For some reason, it will not allow me to pay to remove ads. I find this extremely annoying. It also seems purposeful, since there is a button in the game for that function. I‚Äôve been playing for a while, but I just can‚Äôt take the ads anymore. So, see...Nitrome, you could have made some more money from me, but now I‚Äôm just going to delete the game."
"13740",1128801236,"This is a really good game, but there could be more levels. Or a way you can make your own levels and such."
"13741",1128839212,"Love this game"
"13742",1128839212,"Fun game.  I can spend hours playing this.  So many different things going on you don‚Äôt get bored."
"13743",1128839212,"When playing this & the other 2 Forest Rescue games they freeze up, is there anyway I can get updates for them so this doesn‚Äôt happen?"
"13744",1128855720,"I have always loved this game but when you try to buy in app purchases you never get the item that you pay for. You don‚Äôt get ANYTHING! I bought five gold cards that cost $4.99 and I got nothing. Oh Bibi needs to fix this. And there are way to many ads. Otherwise I think it‚Äôs a great game."
"13745",1128855720,"Good"
"13746",1128855720,"I‚Äôm having fun with this game but ever since the first tutorial race I can‚Äôt do any more? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs intentional but I want to race."
"13747",1128940693,"I love the game it‚Äôs one that is just easy and fun but I think there is A lot of potential for this game like multiplayer or other game modes. So developers please keep this game going."
"13748",1128940693,"Good graphics, fun gameplay, cool concept."
"13749",1128940693,"I have only gripes about this game after attempting to enjoy it several times. 1. There's no real tutorial for piloting the lander. 2. If you fly the lander away from the shuttle, you will‚Äîfor no apparent reason‚Äîreverse course and slam back into the shuttle, destroying the lander. 3. There's a never-ending stream of dialogue that takes up part of the screen that can't be skipped and is too slow to focus on. I tried to read it, but it's not engaging, entertaining, or informative. 4. The gameplay is extremely repetitive and frustratingly difficult, even on the easiest setting. 5. You're always working against a timer, which can build tension if used correctly, but the time limit is too short for new players to get used to the mechanics and have proper time to explore the various objects and enemies found on the asteroids.  Developers, you can still fix this game. Start with 10 minutes on the timer, gradually decreasing that as the player makes progress. Also start with as much of a tutorial for piloting the lander and dealing with the asteroid gravity as the one for controlling the astronaut (the only fun part so far). Let players skip from one message to the next one. Explain some of the pick-ups on the asteroids.  I keep finding this bubble thing, but can't seem to use it for anything. Good luck."
"13750",1129050711,"Why is it someone can rob you 18 times bomb you 23 times and you can‚Äôt get them back. It seems pretty unfair to me. Only thing to do is delete them or the game."
"13751",1129050711,"I am completely hooked on this game! I absolutely love it! I spend more money on this game than I do my own self! It‚Äôs worth it though! You get to have a lot of fun and meet so many wonderful people. Give it a try you will become addicted as well! I also want to say I finished my last island and I think the game developers should not let you get bombed or money stolen! I feel as if you have to wait for the next island to come out and you are finished with the game that your island should be protected as well as your money! I think it is unfair that you move on automatically to the next island when you are done but when you finish the game you have to wait until the next island comes out in a week or so and you have to keep checking on it to make sure that you are not being bombed. I think the game developers need to change that!!"
"13752",1129050711,"I love the game graphics are cool and the game is entertaining"
"13753",1129234419,"I just got this game and looking at the views no one complained about the adds! As happy as could be, I open the app. I beat the first level, Add. Try the second level but use a hint, Add. Beat that level, Add. Like I said, I just got this app, I may or may not get the no add extension pack. But for those who can‚Äôt and have to watch adds, do NOT download. I repeat, do NOT download!!!!  (P.S, the game it self is fun, but not with constant adds.)"
"13754",1129234419,"I get an ad after every single level, and after every single hint. It‚Äôs not even worth the $2 to get rid of them. Just make the app cost that much if you‚Äôre gonna be that big of a greedy douche"
"13755",1129234419,"I like the game, but I can hardly play any of it. Every time I restart a level, or move on to the next, there‚Äôs a 30 second add waiting for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong that is how these people get money, so I‚Äôm ok with a few adds here and there, but this is just ridiculous. The worst part is I feel like they do this on purpose. They knew how obnoxious the adds were, so they made it so you can PAY to turn them off. Now that makes sense, but it basically forces you to buy it because the game isn‚Äôt any fun unless you pay to turn off the adds."
"13756",1129404572,"Can Big Fish do ANYTHING without witchcraft? The little symbols throughout most of their games are clearly evil and wrong for anyone."
"13757",1129404572,"Short game, short review.  Other reviewers have mentioned the color, story plot, and collectibles, etc.  I felt the plot was a little thin, but interesting.  My biggest complaint was the minuscule length of the game, and the bonus game was like a small mid-West town:  Blink and you miss it!  PS-I never review a game until I have completed it, but thanks to those who quickly and thoroughly review new games!  I never buy a game without reading at least 3 solid reviews, and Big Fish only keeps new games at a reasonable price for 3 days."
"13758",1129404572,"Some of the BF games of late have been a little too creepy for me. While I don't always want to be a princess, I don't want to be a homicide detective either. This game has a nice balance of suspense and eeriness without venturing into true horror.  You've most likely already read the reviews about the storyline and the land of Emoless--so I'll get right to the game itself.  Fundamentals are good. Voice overs, cutscenes, graphics, labeled inventory, teleporting map, collectibles, etc. are hard to argue with.  Good against evil main plot is fun, too.  Minigames are fun and diverse, albeit pretty easy.  I didn't play this until after the sale was over, but given the short length, the lack of originality in some of the puzzles, and ease of puzzles, I don't think it is worth the full fare. If it were discounted again, I would recommend it, but I can't do the same at full price.  Good wishes to all.  üçÇüçÇ"

"13768",1129966892,"It's a good game and has enough room to level up with out spending a lot, or you can and it isn't too expensive. It has a lot of potential, but it doesn't seem like the developer is investing a lot into the server or in marketing, which would make this game one of the top games to play free. They could make some serious money and have a great platform, it's just not being run correctly to capitalize on what they have."

"13778",1130374815,"I got this for Christmas. The first time it worked like a charm! But, after a second use, it got glitchy.  1: the camera turns white and glitches like hell 2: disconnects every few minutes 3: always unresponsive  4: terrible sound 5: doesn‚Äôt record videos and the microphone doesn‚Äôt send audio. 6: you have to be kidding by ‚Äúspy bot‚Äù. It is SUPER LOUD. this was a massive disappointment. I‚Äôm hoping to get the MeBo 2.0.  If that won‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll warn other about this piece of trash"
"13779",1130374815,"It's a bad app .I never ever recommend getting this app.It is terrible.After a while the app doesn't work.After that it is just a plastic toy.I think that I would rather get a app that works. I hate this app.The only good thing was that it worked for a while and it was fun for a while. Thank you for looking at this review."
"13780",1130398188,"When I use this app on GarageBand, for some reason it keeps quitting. If you fix this bug again, then I will give it five stars. I like the synths though."
"13781",1130398188,"I got this app shortly after it came out.i have all their other synths and was so excited to get.im running ios8.4 but the app will not open past the brief page that displays then nothing. I contacted apple twice for refund and contacted the developer a couple times. After the initial contact they gave me a suggestion to try nut still no change. I really wanted it to work but now I'm ignored which puts me back. I have many apps over past 8 years without this problem. I don't know what to do and lost over $10 and not happy. Beware this app and poor service."
"13782",1130398188,"I own too many synth apps that are so so. This one does not disappoint in terms of sound or interface. So good"
"13783",1130498044,"The problem I had with my MacBook was probably super simple but nevertheless, this app is great since it‚Äôs very convenient! Apple really knows their audience, huh?   I rarely write reviews (though I feel like I should start doing so), but the service deserved one! Awesome customer service; I didn‚Äôt feel like a bother at all and it was actually a very pleasant exchange even though I‚Äôve been on edge because of the problem I had with my MacBook. The solution I was given was helpful and it worked!"
"13784",1130498044,"When I chat with an Apple employee, things are usually resolved quick and easy. The thing I noticed today, was that when I tried to email the chat transcript, it says it‚Äôs unable to email it."
"13785",1130498044,"These people at apple support are helpless.  Google knew better than apple people. Haha"
"13786",1130542083,"6 networks listed on JFK, none of them works. Useless..."
"13787",1130542083,"Useless and useless"
"13788",1130542083,"Each time I do a search, the app says that it can not connect to your servers.  Internet is working via cellphone fine.  Please refund my $1.99  Thank you..."
"13789",1130610367,"I love this game it is all about staregy  and I love Lorax hope y‚Äôall get back together thoüíîüòçü§ûüèª and this is now my fav app so yah üòÇ."
"13790",1130610367,"Great üëçüèæ it great But butt but but uncoordinated with hands and don‚Äôt turn"

"13794",1130630397,"The are so adds when ever I click on one single thing"
"13795",1130723425,"Best app I've ever used"
"13796",1130723425,"Noice"
"13797",1130723425,"Great game"
"13798",1130829481,"It‚Äôs so good you should really get it"
"13799",1130829481,"Very dope app!"
"13800",1130829481,"Honestly this mod is so good and easy!!"
"13801",1130901077,"Ok this game is just wow. I love that there‚Äôs no levels no upgrades no any off that it‚Äôs simply just download and race but I do have one suggestion. I wish there was a reply mode were you could watch the race from different camera angles but the game is amazing and keep up the good work."
"13802",1130901077,"I love this game so much. It‚Äôs graphics, its gameplay completely throws F1 Mobile Racing into the ground, and its an incredible game! Theres just one problem.  If this game ever gets updated, make sure that there should be a option for iCloud backups from device to device. My iPhone on season mode was on the Brazil race, (20th race on the season) and i never went on F1 for about a week. A week goes by and I go to do the Brazil Grand Prix, but it restarted everything, season, race setups, and race weekends! I was very outraged by it, so I thought I could load the save from my iPad, that was on the Canadian GP, and it didnt work. This is a 5 star worth game, but I‚Äôm not putting 5 stars till this get added."
"13803",1130901077,"It is awesome, it is the best racing game on mobile. So you should get it."
"13804",1131203560,"This app is an amazing app because it helps you learn more and helps you understand what things mean"
"13805",1131203560,"Can you PLEASE make it so you can delete old accounts. I didn‚Äôt like my old account so I tried to make a new one with the same email address and it didn‚Äôt let me because it was already in use. PLEASE fix this. This is such a good game other than that. If you fix it I will definitely fix my review. Thank You!"
"13806",1131203560,"Overall this app is amazing, you can play games, riddles and quizzes! ALTHOUGH this app is a bit confusing and I really hated how they didn‚Äôt give me enough time to figure out the answer for the questions, but still great."
"13807",1131232060,"After reading all the mixed reviews, I was afraid I wasn't going to fully enjoy this game. But so far, I'm loving it; the music is so good, the aesthetic and art of the weapons and sounds - pretty cool.  This would help, there should be an indicator as to when your weapon's ammunition is at max, that way people won't waste ammo pick ups while not knowing they are at max already.  Good game so far - keep up the improvements!  Omg the music is sooo gooood!! üòÄ"
"13808",1131232060,"Although this game is described to be a rogue-like, I was disappointed that many of the elements like permadeath, steep difficulty increase, traps, and unique items do not appear. I enjoyed the awesome music, pixel art, and thematic mashups from other games. At the moment this is more like a strategic clicker than a rogue-like game."
"13809",1131232060,"Finally a simple rpg that doesn't overwhelm you with overly done crafting mechanics and just focuses on easy to pick up hard to master strategy/inventory managing fun combat. Art and sound is fun and perfect for this game."
"13810",1131251130,"We love it! I like the non-verbal directions. The app is ideal for my students who have trouble with oral directions in English."

"13813",1131342792,"At the moment I am pretty upset, but I am hopeful for a resolution to the issue.  Aside from that I am pretty happy with the service , exception being that the area I am in has been really slow my first work week.   I enjoy being able to see new places in my community that I had no idea existed, and met some very nice people.    Delivery pickups are fairly quick and easy to navigate in the App and Delivery has been pretty simple as well.   I just wished that the App would integrate with my AV display in my vehicle, so that I can mirror the app features on the larger screen, and not have to keep picking up my phone to see what is going on and interact with the app, with the touch screen.  It would also allow me to see new messages and orders easier.   I wish that the Uber Eats support system would be handled and contacted separate from the Ride Share support folks.  It is apparently an issue when the ride share support group has no idea of the policies that govern the operations of the Uber Eats driver; which has caused some issues between myself and Uber Ride share Drivers Support crew.   One tried to suspend my account because I disagreed with him on territory policy, and claimed that Uber didn‚Äôt operate in my area.  Funny how I was able to work in my area for the last work week.  Duh!   Now with that being said, I figure that for the first week of my work, with Uber Eats has been really fun and enjoyable; in spite of the issues that just came up.    I am hopeful that a productive resolution will be worked out, as I would not want to be pushed into consideration of going elsewhere.  But we shall see what the outcome will be."
"13814",1131342792,"I‚Äôve dedicated 2.5 years of my life driving for uber and it is so unpredictable. I live in a BUSY city (Denver) and lately I‚Äôve been waiting multiple hours for a single ride!!! Thank God for lyft. I have driven over 4,600 trips on uber alone and have managed to have an overall 4.97 driver rating (which is easily in the top of the charts) and my thanks for being a good driver is waiting hours for a single request even when it‚Äôs surging in downtown Denver? There is no incentive for having a high rating so what‚Äôs the point of driving safe and going the extra mile to smile and help people with their luggage when drivers  with much lower ratings are getting rides while I‚Äôm stuck fiddling my thumb waiting. Absolutely BS!!!!! Getting frustrated and uber is going to lose a good driver because I can‚Äôt deal with this much longer!!!! It‚Äôs ridiculous!!!"
"13815",1131342792,"I‚Äôm wasn‚Äôt sure to do it but I‚Äôm really happy for what I been done in those 2 past days!! I‚Äôm really thinking about to do Uber drive beside the delivery!!! That‚Äôs how exciting I am!"
"13816",1131344092,"Great music, but this game is just a copy of color switch"
"13817",1131344092,"Who can play this game for hours at once?!! If I have attained a certain level... I should be able to go to a meeting and pick back up where I left off!"
"13818",1131344092,"But not when they pop up IN THE MIDDLE OF GAMEPLAY. I don't know if this is intentional, or a bug, but its happened to me more then several times. One time I was about to beat my highscore and was interrupted by an AD. The game just stopped in the middle of gameplay and started playing an ad."
"13819",1131388981,"Just downloaded the game And nothing works. Very upset. Makers please help me fix it"
"13820",1131388981,"Have played 5 games and two of them have just stopped working."
"13821",1131388981,"The game just crashes. Don‚Äôt waste you time. It makes me not want to buy the card game. If they can‚Äôt respect their customer enough to create a working product why should I spend my money on any more of their products?"
"13822",1131422575,"I have been looking for a hard game to play and this is the one I think so far"
"13823",1131422575,"Fun!! Hard to control"
"13824",1131422575,"Fun! Hard to control sometimes...finger gets in the way!  Otherwise - I enjoy it very much."
"13825",1131590898,"Would like my money back. Seriously disappointing, from the controls to the lack of original level selection. Just bad."
"13826",1131590898,"Too easy....to be fair I have a ton of experience with LUMINES... the controls are a little wonky at first but I have over 8 hours logged on the same match on endless and have never come close to the match ending... the skins never really get difficult enough..even with the more  narrow field this game is no challenge for an experienced player, not bad if you need to kill 5-10 minutes here and there."

"13841",1132336222,"played for 10-15 seconds. restarted 3 times.  starts out way too difficult for me. not interested in taking 15-30 minutes before i can enjoy it. others might. it seems well designed though. ad obnoxious level as per other reviews,  confirmed"
"13842",1132336222,"It's a hard game to play, that's not a large problem though. There are too many ads which makes everything so laggy. We all hate ads but it's even worse when there are 10Xs more ads than there should be and the ads make it lag!"

Except that I you like the review you can love the review even that‚Äôs what I want. Guess me and I will lick your body and the fairytales were cool except for vanellope. Like my review and fairytale story. Don‚Äôt worry if you break something. We can rebuild it together!"
"13847",1132517788,"I paid for this app and thought it would be great. Unfortunately my daughter showed me that half of the features don't even work. No soundtracks, I can't flip characters, and more. I've tried restarting and reinstalling and still nothing. Also don't expect support from the company, their website has no way of helping you and the App Store link for support takes you to an error page. Clearly, they don't care."
"13848",1132517788,"I wanted to buy this app but I couldn't understand why this app has only 13 reviews. The free version was good as well except there was only one fairytale theme. That's why I bought this app so I can get all the fairytale themes! And it does have more fairytale themes. It's fun! It's a lot better than Toca Boca apps. Safe fun and kid friendly! It's so fun to mix fairytales together and you can even put together scenes and save it and edit them later! So convenient! Lot better than Frozen Story Theater! Keep up the good work!"
"13849",1132537738,"Game has overpriced itself in the market. Very few low cost options to gain strength and status. The game used to have great options from spending anything from .99 cents and up now to get the major rewards they want $250.00 and up still play but don‚Äôt pay. I‚Äôm vip 10 which means I‚Äôve spent over $1000.00 and was happy with my previous play and spending but that is no longer the case"
"13850",1132537738,"Gameplay is relatively fun, but the acting is left of the horrible. It‚Äôs hard to get past it for me, but maybe some people won‚Äôt mind how silly it is."
"13851",1132537738,"Great, Great gameüëç"
"13852",1132539563,"Draw a straight line through rapidly swirling shapes‚Äîrequires extremely quick reflexes.  Only 4 stars because it so soon got too difficult for me to do."
"13853",1132539563,"Finding where to draw your line is the fun part of the game, but it's pretty frustrating when you have such a small window in which to draw it. If you're not twitchy enough to get it right, you are rewarded by having to wait for the sequence to line up again. Not a puzzle, not interesting for long, not fun."
"13854",1132539563,"Good!!"
"13855",1132542642,"I love when they make sounds I like the purple cat ,cause it‚Äôs my favorite Eric Carle stories are so cool even the hungry caterpillar I love the music in this app send story toys apps are so cool"
"13856",1132542642,"My son loves this app, but for some reason the sound does not work.  I have tried everything and I am very tech savvy. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it. Please help!"
"13857",1132542642,"My grandson loves the book, and this app is a great extension for him to play with. We love recording our own animal sounds, and sometimes record us saying the names of the animals, instead. At first the sound wasn‚Äôt working, but I emailed support, and someone responded promptly, the next day, with the exact suggestion I needed to make the sound work (by turning off the mute switch!)."
"13858",1132630378,"I love artüíû This game is too smallüôÅ But it‚Äôs awesome ü§ó"
"13859",1132630378,"AMP is a great intro for young kids to the basic concepts of drawing by using different shapes. I‚Äôm a graphic designer and was keen for my son to get an early start as an artist, this game uses a story game format to really engage kids while improving their motor skills. His favorite part is drawing the outhouse and the doggie. Another great game from Minilab studios!"
"13860",1132630378,"Me being older than the age it's made for and still liking it is amazing. Or I'm just weird. XD But I love the focus on shapes! The art work is really cute and it has a tiny plot! I was able to get this free bc it was the free app of the week (which tells you it purty Gud) idk how much it actually is but I think it should be around erm 99 cents"
"13861",1132754743,"Run jump with the most likeable character, killer time."
"13862",1132754743,"The characters are adorable! I love the little win animations. It's also a really innovative tap based gameplay mechanic. My only critique is that it stars off easy and stays easy. I never really felt challenged. Something about the spinning animals is mesmerizing thoug... I couldn't put it down."
"13863",1132754743,"I love this game, it's really easy to get into and it's super addictive! I don't really think there's nothing quite like this, the graphics are really fun and it's really enjoyable to play. Totally recommend it"
"13864",1132762804,"Awesome news service very professional"
"13865",1132762804,"Five stars"
"13866",1132762804,"La aplicaci√≥n deber√≠a tener el traductor en espa√±ol y otros idiomas"
"13867",1132817034,"It refreshes that's all that matters now if every one post on here the moment you catch a Pokemon ppl will have time to drive walk to location. Other apps simply post findings and then don't refresh. Spawns don't stay the same for non commen to rare Pokemon. This is first one I found that refreshes or at least time stamps each find so I know it's good. Going to get some Pokemon ""peace"""
"13868",1132817034,"How is this supposed to help me find pokemons ?"
"13869",1132817034,"It is clear to me that a majority of those leaving reviews for this app do not understand that this isn't a radar that shows you right when a pokemon spawns or where one is at all times, it is a crowdsourced app that shows previous spawn points for pokemon that are inputted by other users. Contrary to everyone's beliefs, this app does exactly as it is supposed to. The only REAL problem with the app as well as with the multitude of other apps exactly like this one is that because users input the data, it may or may not be true. Some people put in real and helpful information, while unfortunately, others don't. I wouldn't recommend downloading the app just due to that fact."
"13870",1132842255,"This game is horrible. There is no control you just press a button it bump the ball. Waste of a dollar."
"13871",1132842255,"Terrible game. You can't even move the players around and you just have to press some buttons.. Don't waste your money on it."
"13872",1132842255,"Terrible game !!! Unfortunately lose money buying this game ! Crap app ! I want my money back!"
"13873",1132915398,"This might not be a game but it is artistic and awesome, 3 Dollars will spend,. It only problem it has is a little short but from what I saw it has a excellent atmosphere and beautiful scenery to match it detailed levels. Each level has its own story to tell in a very unique way, that I never seen before.  Perfect master piece I recommend to everyone who enjoys a small but interesting experience, you can‚Äôt go wrong with this."
"13874",1132915398,"Bizarre and beautiful, plus the sound design is superb.  As stated, this is not a game in any sense of the word.  This is interactive art that will transport if the individual interacting with it allows it to do so.  Best played in the dark with headphones on.  Herbal stimulation not necessary but is certainly complimentary.  üòè"
"13875",1132915398,"Love the style, mood , and surrealism of this place. Enjoyed very much, hope there will be a sequel some day"
"13876",1132992868,"I like the idea of gamification, if you use this app, more stuff is unlocked?  I've slept to it twice, I see 5ish scenes, can make it rain, on my tent, with birds singing.  How much use is required to unlock more features?  Do I have to actively be using it to earn points?  Or using it as background noise generator?  Sleep aid?  Please let me know Franz, or another experienced flow-er....  thanks."
"13877",1132992868,"It was so nice"
"13878",1132992868,"I use this app for reading when I need a bit of calming white noise, and for sleeping when I‚Äôm sharing a room with someone who snores.  The rain sounds are perfectly clear, and the ability to customize and adjust the sound levels of rain, stream, and birdsong adds a lot to the experience."
"13879",1133173046,"Fun game.  But get anywhere you really need to spend money on the unit upgrade packs or the enemy will easily overpower you.  Waiting for shards and equipment upgrades is very slow unless you purchase them."
"13880",1133173046,"I have been playing this game for about 20 days, and I'd definitely say it's a great game. However, tonight I was trying to playing this game, it said 'user credentials do not match' and I just could not log in. I looked for support, but there was no such issues. It is driving me mad!!!"
"13881",1133173046,"Since upgrade on 9/16/2019 I can no longer play app. It now displays an authentication failure error, which won‚Äôt allow me to bypass.  Since I didn‚Äôt signup when I started using this app, I suspect this is a bug.  Hope it‚Äôs fixed soon."
"13882",1133241575,"The other reviewer's noted that it felt a little short and it did. But I liked the game. I like that it didn't have any super creepy dark spooky music in the background. And it would be cool if we could go back and find the collectibles we missed. I missed one!"
"13883",1133241575,"Love these types of games"
"13884",1133241575,"This game was so boring I didn't finish it.  No glitches, just a thrown together dud.  I enjoy fairy tales, dragons etc... but this was just a bunch of uninteresting cut scenes punctuated by supposedly hidden object scenes (the objects weren't hidden unless you were visually impaired) and some ridiculously repetitive mini games.  Throwing in a bunch of admittedly adorable critters does not make a poor game any more engaging."
"13885",1133510322,"I am not allowed to pay for games and I love this game"
"13886",1133510322,"DANCE you forgot dance and yes dance is a sport"
"13887",1133510322,"Ok so my children were super excited to play but then when we found out that you have to pay for sports and that made them upset so I would highly recommend that you make the game actually free because my kids love it just they are sad that you have to pay for other sports."
"13888",1133737578,"Great, great game. Seamless gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, compelling visuals, thoughtful subject matter. Buy now!!!!!!!!"
"13889",1133737578,"Just wow. I can‚Äôt really put into words the message this game imparted on me. The interaction between the two ‚Äúbeings‚Äù says it all without a word being said. One cannot fly without the other, if one falls the other comes back, the interaction between the two was brilliant. Just absolutely breathtaking and beautiful. I cried. That‚Äôs all that really needs to be said."
"13890",1133737578,"I‚Äôve been wanting to try this game for a long time and I finally got it. I really liked the in game settings and the music that goes well with the plot. The last chapter of the game is what really got me. It‚Äôs kind of a sad game but also relax at the same time. The only thing that I wish for is for you guys to develop more chapters and make some new updates in the game so that we are not just stuck with the same contents, this could help others be interested too. Thank you."
"13891",1133744473,"The game is amazing, but I wish it supported more complication styles and was optimized for the series 4 apple watch"
"13892",1133744473,"Great game very fun my only complaint is that I don't know how to change gamemode on Apple watch"
"13893",1133744473,"I don't know how to change the game mode and it's boring"
"13894",1133749572,"The game itself is a good arcade game. Nothing special, very simple, with nice background music. The problem is that after playing it for a while, there is no more variety. I have maxed out all the possible color schemes for my game piece, so I'm just accumulating useless points. Additionally, the game map itself is just three or four of the same structures infinitely repeated. It's very repetitive, and it's getting boring. As is the case with all of these free arcade games, the ads are very intrusive and have even destroyed my score by popping up during the game! All in all, good game, but these glaring issues make it too boring to play after a while."
"13895",1133749572,"It‚Äôs a good game but adds keep on popping up mid game when I play and it‚Äôs just really frustrating can you plz fix that?"
"13896",1133749572,"I LOVE this game! The aesthetic of it is very nice and chill, it's a very relaxing game. Only flaw I feel is that there should be an option to lower or increase control sensitivity. At times the controls feel quite heavy and can mess up the player's timing."
"13897",1133883216,"It‚Äôs a great game. Still trying to get past any level after the normal difficulty of the real world level. There are no guides or hints or walkthroughs to help out, but I‚Äôll keep trying. Good job developers!"
"13898",1133883216,"Definitely fun to play around with! Recommend this game if you‚Äôre into games like Plague Inc.  Review 2: The developers should also make another game where you try to freeze the planet and not burn it. Fantastic!"
"13899",1133883216,"I love the game, but I‚Äôm wondering if you can add the following features: - if music/effects are off, play external music at normal volume. Right now it plays at a lightly muted volume if I‚Äôm in game. - disable tutorials if I‚Äôve played a specific campaign - make it easier to level up! I know this goes against the IAP scheme in this game, but it would be nice to have a more fruitful unlock system."
"13900",1133896041,"I really like this game. Especially for children. But it would be better if you could multiple click it. It would be easier to click the duckies üôÉ"

"13902",1133896041,"This game looks cool at first but then just get boring. All you have to do is tap the ducks and explode  them before they explode. You can also start chain reactions from exploding the ducks. Within the 10 mins of playing the game I got bored of this. If they added more things like power ups or even and arcade mode this game would be so much better."
"13903",1133898987,"This is a copycat of Crossy road,but more fun."
"13904",1133898987,"OMG I can't believe I downloaded the pictures on the App Store for this game they're not real that's not what you do and jumping over obstacles that is stupid this game is horrible and you guys need to fix it up I can't believe I downloaded the pictures on the App Store for this game they're not real that's not what you do and jumping over obstacles that's a stupid this game is horrible and you guys need to fix it up I'm not trying to be rude I'm not trying to be rude. it makes me want to cry and I never been so disappointed at a game You guys need to really do what it says on the pictures on the App Store bye for now."

"13908",1133990005,NA
"13909",1134086133,"Honestly, I was a bit skeptical of the app when I heard about it...but it's surprisingly addictive, and it has spread throughout my friend group very quickly.   The interface is smooth, the product works seamlessly with my iPhone, and it makes playing Pokemon Go tons of fun. I'd give it a shot if you're on the fence."
"13910",1134086133,"The devs of this app don't monitor the locations and photos. I saw a picture of a dead person as one of the Pokemon locations."
"13911",1134086133,"Love Pokemon go, love this app!"
"13912",1134126831,"Good Science App with Lots of Activities.  My only suggestion is for additional information or some sort of links to learn more about the given activities would be nice."
"13913",1134126831,"I‚Äôm starting to get into engineering in high school and loved how many simulations there are,  but these are way to basic. It gives you an introduction but you only have 5 min worth of material from each simulation. Example: the Build an Atom only let‚Äôs use 10 protons. You only get to learn about 10 atoms???"
"13914",1134126831,"My kids like to ‚Äúplay‚Äù PhET, and I like to watch them exploring and discovering science and math ideas with these simulations! Definitely a go-to choice for our family when we are traveling ... and I love that it runs without needing a connection."

"13918",1134511982,"Please remove this game or fix it, it keeps switching to safari and last time to pornographic images!!"
"13919",1134511982,"I like this tangram like game a lot, and almost was willing to put up with the ad redirects (it opens up a browser spontaneously mid game, even when you‚Äôre not close to tapping the ad target), ugh even when it happened 2-3 times a game. But most recently it‚Äôs been crashing mid game and not saving the game with is frustrating. That was the last straw."
"13920",1134511982,"I really like this game, but I have deleted and redownloaded it twice already. It seems to have some type of bug where it stops in the middle of the game, opens safari, then says ‚Äúunable to load page‚Äù and if you try to go back to the game it keeps doing it over and over until it eventually freezes and you lose whatever game you were playing and have to start over. I would love it if you could fix this glitch."
"13921",1134516647,"I love the game but less ads would be great!!!"
"13922",1134516647,"Dear Developer, Please make it to wear there is not so many adds there is one every time I finish a level ‚òπÔ∏èüò† please take them away!!!!! Other than that I like the game."
"13923",1134516647,"Ok I don‚Äôt mind ads BUT not the long ones! Apple I know you can put ads other ways! Everyone listen. Before you start the game they have long ads that they put on, I don‚Äôt enjoy a game if I have to each a long ad every level, I‚Äôm standing my ground! So I will not be playing this game unless they do something with those long ads! NO MONEY here!its been at least a month and still they put the long ads no they don‚Äôt want you to enjoy a game. You would think they would listen to the buyers! Deleting this for good! Apple u can do better!!!"
"13924",1134640800,"The game opens, I hit start and nothing. The screen goes black. Major problems"
"13925",1134640800,"I'm enjoying this game very much.  Good story line, nice graphics, excellent mini games. Best of all is NO evil, witchery, murders, thank you."
"13926",1134640800,"This is the worst episode of Echoes of the Pasr game I have ever played!"
"13927",1134805859,"I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect after reading the reviews but I really liked this game. It was pretty hard for me at first figuring out what to do but I really liked it once I got the hang of the clues. After you finish the game, make sure you play it again (2nd round) because it has new challenges. I just bought the Isoland 2 and can‚Äôt wait to work through that. Have fun!"
"13928",1134805859,"Each hint requires 1 dollar or watch a 30 sec ad to unlock in a paid game, and there are well over 50 hints. Other paid puzzle adventure games has a time based system to unlock the hints, such as the room, giving players the time to try to solve on their own but also gives players the necessary hints when they are stuck for free. I do not understand why the hint system in this game is behind a pay wall or an ad wall, when clearly there is a better solution available in nearly every game in this category. This just seems to be a cash grab, especially in a game that is not free to purchase."
"13929",1134805859,"It‚Äôs not easy if u don‚Äôt like thinking or find it difficult to solve puzzles this is not the game for u"
"13930",1134835650,"This game is pretty good I hope they make a third one"
"13931",1134835650,"I hope it can support change language to Chinese Thanks"
"13932",1134835650,".99$ seems like it's really cheap, and it is. The game is great and worth that price, however once you get in the game there's and option to buy a 'fortune ticket' for about ten bucks.  Doing so allows for certain options that you were previously lacking, allowing for more hands free grinding. Personally, I bought it, feels like the game needed it, hence the 4 star rating.  For 11 bucks, this game deserves about that.  Strategy has potential to be really deep, and it scratches a bit of that ogre battle 64 itch. Give it a go, it's worth it.  Also, the ticket is a one time thing. No micro transaction pay to win crap at time of writing, which is both admirable and rare in a phone game."
"13933",1134895689,"It‚Äôs good"
"13934",1134895689,"Very epic"
"13935",1134895689,"They add new ships here and there, but by and large this game is just more of the same thing over and over. Same enemies, same weapons, same everything. Overall the game is profoundly lacking in originality or really any kind of exciting content whatsoever. You‚Äôre better off playing almost any other app game. Phoenix 2 is not worth playing."
"13936",1135031533,"On at couple of levels at least, there are objects that block that camera's view at essential turns that are made often for restarts. This makes it a matter of timing, which is fine, but if the timing is off from the music, holding that timing in your head can get annoying.   To the developer, just go through and find these areas where objects are obscuring the the turns and we'll be golden.  To the consumer, the game is an interesting idea built around the idea that you not only will fall, but you have to sometimes to move forward. Nice little sentiment there, but there are some frustrating aspects (like I mentioned above) that seem more like design flaws than challenges. Can I get past these ""flaws"" of course, with practice. But I'd rather overcome challenges that feel like their part of the game, not a design oversight.   Give it a whirl while it's free. If not free, maybe browse a bit further to see if another game steals your interest."
"13937",1135031533,"I'm a sucker for puzzle games and I was really excited for this one. The game looks beautiful and has a calming soundtrack, but becomes frustrating very quickly. You never know which direction your character is going to turn. There are white coins on the map not sure if you're suppose to collect them or not but many lead to death. Some maps have switches that open new paths, and the second you click a switch you fall off the map. By the time you reach the end of a level it feels like more of a chore, rather than feeling a sense of accomplishment.  I do enjoy challenging puzzle games , but with poor level design and random controls I can't find enjoyment in this.  Update to 1 star I have never paid for an app and still get ads. Really annoying, most apps you pay for will remove the ads."
"13938",1135031533,"This review is middling-to-fair that, while this is more effective than meditation apps for mindfulness, the ads are too distracting sometimes to play.  I'm a perfectionist when it comes to most games. I will restart levels for the smallest of mistakes. Because most games seem to have a taunting set-up, 'this EASY level took you THIRTY tries??'  This game stands calmly and gently opposed to that. Mistakes are welcome, encouraged, and rewarded. The glowing cubes to collect often are along the wrong path. The option of skipping a level is only there as a reminder that, it's okay if you're frustrated, you can try again later.  The level design is exactly how this succeeds in what meditation apps can't for me. There is something unknown out there. You can't see the whole level. You have to engage and explore and, even if you anticipate something, you can easily see how you do or don't ""succeed in completing"" whatever task you were attempting.  I know that the developers probably can't control exactly what kind of ads they have, but the game would be much better if they didn't flash. It's fair and understandable that they're there, which is why I rated a 4 rather than say a 3. (I was recommended this on an article of pricey but currently free apps. The ads being there surprised me as the app prices tended to be $3-5.)"
"13939",1135126803,"THIS GAME BURRITO BISON IS HELLA FUNNI AND IS JUST A GOOD GAME KINDA LIKE JETPACK JOYRIDE BUT WAY MORE FUN THE PI√ëATAS ARE SO FUNNY AND THE ADS ARE EXITABLE ANYTIME AND NO POP UPS WHICH ARE AMAZING THIS GANE GOES SKITZZZZZ"
"13940",1135126803,"It is so much fun and I play it every day"
"13941",1135126803,"Good game but it is addictive also make it so when you break the wall have a check point"

"13944",1135127134,"Entertaining, fun, great story. Keeps you on your toes."
"13945",1135213693,"I've played this game for a while now, and I like it to a point. I get that it's supposed to be challenging, but this game glitches all the time for me because I don't think there's been one update since I've actually downloaded this game, so whenever it glitches it makes the time I'm playing unfair which annoys me. So there are issues that need to be fixed so playing it is actually enjoyable."
"13946",1135213693,"I really would like the game if it let you jump all the time and was actually possible to pass certain parts. Also the game does lag a bit"
"13947",1135213693,"I kinda like this game, but I kinda don't. The highest score I can achieve is 259 and I got lucky. Once you get so far, it stops you. I believe the path you take sets up the rest of the game, got it? But, it's also random, from that path. One easy, one hard. Good luck!"
"13948",1135354652,"For the tickets I get that you want people to get on every once and a while but still I hate when I‚Äôm in the car for half an hour and I can‚Äôt even play a mission"

"13952",1135372103,"This is the first time I review a game.. I really enjoy playing this game. But until when I cleared all the first 70 stages (total 75) with gold medals, I found out that I still need a huge amount of coins (above 20k) to unlock the final car.. which makes me feel kinda sad to the game.. I can't play the last 5 mission just because of this.. hopefully you can fix this 'bug' as soon as possible :)"
"13953",1135372103,"It's a great game but it has some kinks in there, but overall it's pretty awesome and there is also SOME glitches! It was better than I though"
"13954",1135441810,"Whenever I do a trick the drone does not let me have any control and plumbers to the ground, I cant even throttle up to make it stop flying down. Also on all of the drones the way you control the throttle is weird and the first time you use each drone it gives you no throttle controls."
"13955",1135441810,"This is a great little app for practicing. Just wish it had more maps and things to maneuver around"
"13956",1135441810,"This app may be unrealistic, but it teaches you how to handle a drone. I‚Äôm kinda better at flying a camera drone than flying a drone without a camera.The problem is that I cannot or buy a real sky viper because my Mom won‚Äôt let me afford one, yet a real video drone sounds fun to me. And any time I need help flying my LUMI drone, I can use the app"

It‚Äôs just so amazing and I‚Äôm going to buy your new app. And I totally recommend this to everyone. I hope you make more pack for this in the future and I hope you make more games like this."

All in all, love the sounds and the ability to add layers of melody....Push the app a little more and open the export option and I‚Äôll give 5 stars happily and sing its praises.

"13985",1135867247,"This is a game of chance, and a very basic on at that. The design is nice, but there is little depth. The description suggests it helps teach fruits from around the world and 'forms'. When really all you do is spin a wheel and collect fruit. Beyond matching colors to the four fruits on the trees, there is no education going on. It only says the names of the fruits once, and that is the first time you play.  My son and I played 7 or 8 rounds of this. We only finished gathering the fruit before Theo stole them on the very first attempt. We planted our 3 seeds, then spent the remaining rounds losing our fruit to Theo.  Perhaps the actual board game, with its multiplayer mode, is more fun and involves some actual thinking. I had planned on buying it for my son soon, but I now doubt I will."

The storyline was logical and engaging. The puzzles were varied in type and difficulty with many new twists on traditional formats. The bonus chapter wrapped up the story instead of presenting a lame prequel or unrelated use of beta version scenes and puzzles. Well done! I hope the next one is as good!"

Its gameplay is actually better than Kingdom Rush (the whole series), The catch is the pixel art is ugly. It‚Äôs messed up my studying for almost 2 weeks. The length of the game is ridiculously long. Fun Fun Fun, Evil Evil Evil lol"
"14016",1136678843,"For us weirdos who prefer to play a game that is optimized for the device were using. I love this game just as much as the new one, thanks for the update and a great game."
"14017",1136744871,"Best game ever"
"14018",1136744871,"This game is not worth it‚Äôs price. It is kind of fun but just not worth it. It also seems like sometimes someone gets alerted when you do nothing, causing the police and partygoers to attack, sometimes making you start over a level that you almost finished. Overall, this game is not very engaging and not very fun. It is definitely not worth the price of $6.99."
"14019",1136744871,"I enjoy this game a lot. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs challenging, and it‚Äôs a great thing to do in your free time. But there seem to be some glitches or something with the unlockable characters. Specifically, I have met the requirements to unlock both Katie and the ninja several times without unlocking them. I have had the cops chase me around 5 times before giving up, and I have played 3 games now where not a single body was detected. I‚Äôm feeling very frustrated because I have met the requirements to unlock these characters and yet they aren‚Äôt unlocked. It seems like more people than just me are having this issue. Fixing it would make the game much more enjoyable."

"14021",1136936929,"Love this game, but I have a suggestion. I hope it‚Äôs possible. If you developers know the movie Avatar, then please read. I want you guys to make an Ultimate Ikran Simulator. Those big dragon things. So how it could work is the ikran choices to unlock are all different colors. Like purple, green, blue, etc... The setting could be the legendary floating islands, and the rainforest that you see in the movie. Every once in a while, the Navi people can show up and the ikrans can try to avoid them, or maybe kill them. The ikrans can be predators, and they can eat several other avatar creatures that live in the forest. I hope that you guys can make this. Respond to this when you made the app, or if you cannot make this. I suggest to get permission from the Avatar movie creators if you ever make this game. I‚Äôm counting on you guys because you make the best ever animal simulator apps. Thanks, and good luck! üòâüôè"
"14022",1136936929,"(If you like this, I suggest listening to a song called Tails One). Ash impatiently waited for the right moment. The herd needed to scatter. She slowly walked the perimeter of the prey circle. Ash then sat behind a bush, again, waiting. She dug her claws into the sand. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù She whispered. Most of the zebras were asleep, but still others were guarding them. It had to be almost dawn by now. A sudden sound caught Ash‚Äôs attention, and she twitched her ears, hoping to get a clearer sound. Ash looked over to where the giant moon was shining, half of it unseen below the ground. It reflected off of Ash‚Äôs curious eyes as she gasped. Ash saw another wild animal. A silhouette of one anyway. She turned away from the zebras completely. Her stomach rumbled as she took a guilty gaze back at her meal. She hadn‚Äôt eaten in forever though. The silhouette stopped running, and stared straight at Ash. She turned away from it, stalking the zebras once more. Perfect! One of the children had wandered off too far, and everyone (including the child) was asleep. It was too risky to go after an adult right now. Ash zoomed over to it, very gently picking it up. The child didn‚Äôt wake up. Good, she thought. She silently ran to her den with the child in her mouth. The sun began to crest over the Savanna land. The child woke up, drowsily looking up at Ash. It‚Äôs eyes opened wide, and it tried to scream and run, but Ash clamped her jaws around its neck. She bit down. Hard. Immediately, the child went limp. Ash delightfully gobbled it down. She curled up, hoping for some rest. A sudden thought nudged at her. Who was that last night? She squeezed her eye and repositioned, but she sat up, frustrated. A cheetah ran up to her. ‚ÄúFang!‚Äù She shouted, happy to see her brother again. He looked terribly upset. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Ash asked, full of concern. ‚ÄúMother is dead.‚Äù He said sadly. Ash let it sink in, then threw herself at the stone wall, causing her shoulder to bleed. ‚ÄúWHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS!!!?‚Äù She screamed, listening to her echoing cries. A hiss from outside the den sounded. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù Fang asked. Ash nodded, not caring at the moment. An alligator walked in, hissing more. Ash gasped. Her and Fang growled back. Pain sliced through Ash‚Äôs leg. She hissed in a breath, looking behind at it. Another alligator snapped its jaws at her and tried to bite her leg again. ‚ÄúFang, there‚Äôs another one!‚Äù Ash exclaimed. Fang attacked the first alligator. In three seconds, Fang was dead. Ash looked with wide eyes for a long time. The alligators tried to kill Ash too, but she raced out of her den, now homeless and alone. She ran out faster than she ever had. Tears blurred her vision repeatedly. The cheetah silhouette walked up to her and Ash tripped, her vision still hazy and blurry. The cheetah looked at her. ‚ÄúYou ok?‚Äù He asked. Ash nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Blur.‚Äù He said as he helped Ash up. That‚Äôs where it all began. Not long later, they became mates. Ash looked in the distance at her new home, smiling happily at Blur and their cub, who was sleeping in between them. There was a cheetah. One Ash could‚Äôve sworn she saw before. She stood up. ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù She asked in disbelief. Ash raced towards her, feeling exhilarated to run. They almost got to each other when the ground split and shook. ‚ÄúWhat the-? What‚Äôs going on!?‚Äù Ash shouted to Blur. Blur picked up their cub, Dash, and ran over to her. A large gap opened in the earth, and Ash watched her mother and her family hang on to the edge, Dash squealing for help. Ash couldn‚Äôt save anyone. She was frozen. For the first time in the world, Ash‚Äôs fur turned black. She ran over to save them both with her newly found super-speed...  The world turned black. Ash saw nothing but darkness. It was confusing, then she saw why. Ash was not supposed to exist. Now that her existence had become irrelevant, the world had to swallow her up, starting with her family. That‚Äôs why Fang died. That‚Äôs why she was going to die. Her superpowers made sure of that. Wait- her superpowers!!! Ash ran and ran and ran until her paws hurt. She was running up the earth, but she didn‚Äôt know if she had time to save anyone this time. She almost made it to the top, and the earth closed up on her, just like that. She was moving so fast, though, that she was simply phasing through the earth. Ash would soon fall into space. She closed her eyes. Though her life seemed to be speeding by in her memories, she took everything for granted. Ash opened her eyes, and she was on the ground. What just happened? Ash looked around. It was the Savanna. Blur walked up to her. ‚ÄúAsh!‚Äù He said excitedly, ‚ÄúWe can time travel!‚Äù  TO BE CONTINUED."

"14104",1139753965,"I was so excited to see this was getting re-done, but even though it's different it's just as hard as the first version to advance, if not more difficult.  I'm stuck in chapter 2 because it's requiring me to upgrade my hero, which I can only do by beating puzzles (which i can't do right now), getting free pieces from the tavern (once a day), or purchasing gems. I have tried to purchase four different packages and I got charged for all of them but didn't receive anything I paid for. So basically the game is impossible AND will rip you off. Very disappointed."
"14105",1139753965,"You've just changed the rules by changing cost and effect of abilities!!!! Zero stars. You've lost me. Ciao baby !!!!!"
"14106",1139753965,"This game is awesome. It's really interesting and keeps you wanting to discover other chaptersüòÄüòÄ"
"14107",1140023495,"The app is amazing. The VR videos are entertaining and there is a vast variety of them to choose from. My only complaint is that I have to take my phone out of the VR headset every time I want to watch a video. I think it would be cool if there was something like the VRVideoWorld app that allowed us to use the app entirely in VR and control what we want to watch by looking at the options."
"14108",1140023495,"You can do the exact same thing with YouTube. If you know what you‚Äôre doing, YouTube has magnificent videos with far fewer steps"

"14111",1140040414,"The makeup looks are pretty. The only thing I would complain about is not being to edit a photo from photo library. And probably no auto save"
"14112",1140040414,"Every time it makes my face thinner!  Ugh!  My face is already too thin; it needs to be rounder and fuller, if anything.  Other than that, it does easily apply a variety of makeup looks."

"14114",1140186382,"Game is good"
"14115",1140186382,"I love this app I could play it all day some games are hard but I still win them. The one problem is that there is to much adds and the wrist part is sometimes there all the same which is really annoying."
"14116",1140266903,"I‚Äôm totally hooked and can‚Äôt stop playing. I wish you made more levels"
"14117",1140266903,"I am abroad now. No one takes over my phone. My mom used to take over my phone. Really miss her."

"14119",1140351199,"This solitaire game literally has it all!! You can play live against others worldwide in the tournament section, play the games in the Daily section, and play single games by yourself. So it literally has everything in one wonderful solitaire app!! I‚Äôve downloaded a bunch of solitaire apps in the past and this is by far the best one I have ever had and I play every day!! Highly recommend this game!! üíï"
"14120",1140351199,"Love this app. Has everything I like about playing solitaire, so many options. I‚Äôm hooked!"
"14121",1140351199,"a great fun game! Please keep or insert a choice for left-handers to play this game, okay? Thanks!"
"14122",1140396820,"The game is all about timing when to disappear and when to re-appear. My high score is 27 and I played for like 5 minutes already. The game is not confusing at all."
"14123",1140396820,"I see a lot of negative reviews due to no instructions, the controls are extremely simple and I figured them out right a way. However the game is quite repetitive and vanishing is not instantaneous."
"14124",1140396820,"Unclear on what to do."

"14129",1140419709,"Whenever you complete a manga, there's a screen that gives you exp and states how much plot points you earn, but sadly the plot points bar doesn't update at all, so you don't get the value stated"
"14130",1140419709,"I started with Game Dev Story like you probably did, and I've played through almost every Kairosoft game like you might have. If you're a fan of Game Dev Story and/or Anime Studio Story you should scoop this one up for sure!"
"14131",1140451547,"Fun app that prolly deserves more ‚Äústars‚Äù but some of the tutorials do not work. Sent an email to developer with no response."
"14132",1140451547,"Crazy, this app really works great! Never expected to have so much fun with a golf app. Had it for a week now and not yet even scratched the surface of all the features this app has. Love it!"
"14133",1140451547,"I don‚Äôt write reviews but need to share my experience with this app. It is absolutely phenomenal! Hs a ton of different features and has blown all of my expectations away. If you play golf then Shot Tracer is a must have app!"
"14134",1140495295,"I have enjoyed the game so far, but unfortunately a bug causes the screen to be cut off on the right side and bottom. I can‚Äôt find a fix anywhere other than someone mentioning the iphone XR has this issue. I doubt this will ever get fixed but if it does that‚Äôd be cool because this game is adorable and I‚Äôd like to give it a real chance."

"14138",1140513212,"Sometimes it feels like the other characters are ganging up on you. I had the game freeze up once...had to leave for about a day. A little more explanation of the different types of games is needed.  (Classic vs. Story)"
"14139",1140513212,"I like fun quick board games.  This is a fun quick board game.  I do not regret purchasing this game and you won‚Äôt either."
"14140",1140680115,"It‚Äôs fun I love the fast past but it lags the Character ahead the pad and it makes the challenges and runs harder."
"14141",1140680115,"Could I give this game no stars??? The ads are horrible! The stop you right when you're building up speed and then not to mention that those stupid Sweet Water ads don't EVER go away. You have to exit the app and restart to play again. On top of that the game is just bad in general. Sorry üòî"
"14142",1140680115,"It‚Äôs over all pretty great, it‚Äôs simple and addicting. My only gripe with it is that I don‚Äôt think they know what the mute button is supposed to do. If I‚Äôm bored I‚Äôll listen to a podcast in the background and play these type of games but it‚Äôs hard to do that with this one when the mute button doesn‚Äôt do anything. A small oversight that‚Äôs just annoying more than anything"
"14143",1141037183,"Good visuals, fun experience, but glad I didn't eaten by the unicorn and bear."

"14149",1141096674,"I love the simplicity of the app. I also love the backstory to John and the risks he took to pay to have an app built for his idea and then go out and spread the word. That's an admirable quality, especially from a 77 yr old man. 99% of people half his age could never take an idea from start to finish like this. Well done, sir."
"14150",1141096674,"Nice straight forward app. Love the history behind it!"

"14152",1141118819,"I was happy to find out this game had a sequel. I had made all superstars on the first game. However, there are some things that could be improved upon. This game is much harder than the first, almost unreasonably. Also, they took away the orange sparks you get when you hole out."
"14153",1141118819,"I have been playing this game for very long. Today I joined a multi player game with my friends, and all of a sudden, I was not doing well. This can‚Äôt be a problem with my skill, I‚Äôm too good. This game is broken. Please fix it."

"14157",1141154420,"It's fun except for the fact that my iPad glitches and causes it to fall. It isn't that addicting to me ig."
"14158",1141304181,"Just a good fun game"
"14159",1141304181,"Quite fun"
"14160",1141304181,"Cool"
"14161",1141358828,"The game play is fun compelling and competitive   Two complaints:  1: it seems like I spend more time watching adds to open loot I‚Äôve already won, even after buying the whole season pack it seems weird I still have to watch adds  2: I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to flag another players name as inappropriate"
"14162",1141358828,"No ads, no prompts to buy stuff, no wait time. It keeps on challenging with new levels and difficulty. I have only played the campaign so far, but I‚Äôm loving it. Highly recommended."
"14163",1141358828,"I have had it ‚Äúinstalling‚Äù for a WEEK."
"14164",1141643627,"The screen goes completely black making the app completely unusable. And yes, I deleted the app then downloaded it again. Does the same thing on my iPhone and iPad."
"14165",1141643627,"App not rendering on iPhone X.  I‚Äôm using the latest iOS and app version.  Spinner just spins."
"14166",1141643627,"I love whataburger and their app concept but I get so annoyed when I order carryout through the app and arrive to the store to find out my order never sent. Big issue that needs to be resolved."
"14167",1141738848,"Another good one from this dev.  Plays well, no glitches, has a manual save, and there are two endings.  Minus a star because this one seems to have more full page video ads than dev's other games.  They display each time you save or un-pause the game :("

"14170",1141762073,"Only got a few puzzles in & I could not figure out the answer.  The hint sucked & in order to see the solution, you have to spend money. Bottom line...I deleted the app. I love brain teasers, but this one is not for me"
"14171",1141762073,"Good game"
"14172",1141762073,"Did it for the coins"
"14173",1141842849,"First of all the arrow keys are too close together. And when you crash your not hitting anything. Last but not least your when you press forward it sometimes breaks your car. And on the taxi level it is very hard to pass one of the levels."

"14175",1141842849,"How did you attach the car to the tow truck"
"14176",1141876504,"This game is so much fun can you tell me the updates"
"14177",1141876504,"Good game overall. Only downside is that as you progress through the game, it ultimately crashes and will not allow the game to restart or reboot. The only cure I have seen is to repeatedly uninstall and then reinstall. Time consuming and annoying. And be sure to log in and save your progress through FB or another means. Otherwise you will lose all progress when you have to reboot."

"14181",1142016085,"Firstly, if you are colorblind (or even partially, like me) be warned that several of the puzzles depend on color matching to solve. But that not why I gave it such a low rating, I don‚Äôt expect the world to cater to me.  I rated the game so low because several of the puzzles just flat don‚Äôt make sense. Even after resorting to watching the walkthrough for a couple of them,I was left scratching my head and thinking ‚Äúok, but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense...‚Äù  The story is definitely... unique. I will give it that. All around, for the price I don‚Äôt feel like I wasted my money. However, I would not recommend it to a friend. If you really like puzzles and need to kill a few hours and the price is under $2.00, eh, just don‚Äôt say you weren‚Äôt warned."
"14182",1142223652,"Terrible graphics on iPad. Using Unity personal edition - not for commercial use."
"14183",1142223652,"Gorgeous game, lovely to play, way too short!"
"14184",1142223652,"Enjoyed this little gem..short, easy, but clever and unique.  Ads are not intrusive, gameplay is smooth, has autosave.  Hope to see more from this dev..thank you!!"
"14185",1142228312,"This game was SO AWESOME üòéI have played with my mom and I have the other games to they are so fun!! I wish it could be better!!üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
"14186",1142228312,"I thought I was rating another game and gave this game 5 stars."
"14187",1142228312,"Sorry, have to change my review after discovering this atrocity...but they are dropping this project/game for good when I already paid full price and they PROMISED new content (in the form of ATLEAST one more level update; it even says in-game 'factory level coming soon!')...but now they say they have 'other projects' they are working on?? Excuse me?? So the fans that finance your game company deserve to get screwed over...and this game obviously did well financially as it was either premium pay with no ads, or free play with ads and the leaderboards show over half a million players! You mean to tell me you didn't make enough money to at least finish what you promised?? Shady business move and everyone should rate this game 1 star and boycott future games from a developer that could abandon you at any moment without warning.  Apple - you need to take direct action against devs pulling this unethical nonsense. This game should be pulled immediately so no other unsuspecting VICTIM pays full price based on a lie for an incomplete game. IOS games are finally being treated with respect with great games coming out; then you get devs like this who give ios AND the App Store a BAD NAME. This honestly feels illegal, and I have no quarrels about bringing it to the attention of the agencies who regulate this sort of thing."
"14188",1142261822,"But one of my teacher‚Äôs assistants, Ms. Beth hates zoos. It will break her heart when I show her the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù animals behind fences and glass in the game. It better then putting them behind bars üòâ. We have a zoo in my city. They‚Äôre going to add lions and giraffes (YAEEEEEHHH!)."
"14189",1142261822,"I help my preschool grandson with this and he loves it.  Some reading skills are required, so Nana has to be present.  His favorites are matching animal sounds with pictures, coloring stripes or spots on animals, as well as pressing the recurring popcorn box to make more popcorn.  The entire sequence keeps his full attention.  Well worth the purchase!"
"14190",1142261822,"I love how it takes kids to the zoo without going anywhere! Last week we took a long road Trip and the first thing my daughters yelled was Grandpa! Grandma!"
"14191",1142334232,"I love the ""live updates"", but wow, this is the most notification SPAM I've ever seen.  I love NHL and NFL notifications, but I could care less about NBA, PGA, or anything else. I turn off those alerts daily, after I get ""home run alert"", or anytime a golfer blows his $&@! nose.  Please fix this.  Love the app, for what I like it for, but someday, I will unistall it because I can't silence the excessive notifications that I could care less about."
"14192",1142334232,"I know the app overall deserves more than a 1-star rating. However, the PGA leaderboard is so useless it is beyond frustrating. Whenever it auto refreshes, it reloads the whole leaderboard at the top. It literally makes me angry trying to use it. Unfortunately, the Draftkings app links directly into to it as well."
"14193",1142334232,"I think you need to stop activating alerts from sports I'm not interested in. I turn off all alerts other than Nba/NFL and after so much time, I'm suddenly getting alerts for PGA and MLB. Cut it out."
"14194",1142345991,"Played all day can't get pass level 5! Too hard, not fun anymore. Will give up!"
"14195",1142345991,"FUUUUUUN"
"14196",1142345991,"I am a person who has no problem buying in-app purchases, but when my money is stolen I will be contacting apple. If this isn't fixed soon."
"14197",1142348885,"absolutely loved this one!"
"14198",1142348885,"Thanx for the heads-up, Izzyoc (and Dracyy) and for telling us about upcoming games. I just wanted to let everybody know that I really handed BigFish their heads on a platter, for the whole Puppet Show debacle. I accepted NO EXCUSES and NO GENERALIZED ANSWERS! I threatened them, basically. So Puppet Show is no longer available. For those of you who bought it, ERS is working to fix it and then will bring it out when it is working properly. They tried and brought out another version but it did not fix the problem, and obviously BigFish doesn't seem to be on their case to fix it! So don't worry about it for now! On to Phantasmat. I was concerned about playing it because the subject matter (murdering family and using their remains, such as bones and ashes, in their artistic endeavors) is truly gruesome and macabre! This game is not for children! When I played it, it was such a fantastic game that I felt the same way as both Dracyy and Izzyoc. The storyline held my interest. There are 3 difficulty settings, although there is no option to customize the settings. It was a decently long game and had a bonus adventure. The graphics were eerily gorgeous and very crisp and clear. The cut-scenes were chilling and quite frightening! At each location you collect a rocking horse and at some you collect a morphing object, and there is an indicator which tells you when you have them. The morphing collectibles allow you to access portfolios of the Ward family. There were many locations and loading WAS instantaneous (for a change) between locations! There is an in-game marked (dependent on settings) teleport map to use. You learn the story via notes, and objectives were regularly updated. Inventory is labeled and interactive and there are complex items to assemble. The HO scenes had variation, and if you preferred not to play the scene you could play match-3 instead. I actually enjoyed the puzzles in this game; there were some new ones and they weren't only boring rotational junk! My actual rating is 4.5 stars, and I deducted half a star due to lack of a cohesive journal. The game ran smoothly and I did not encounter any glitches. This game was extremely clever and I enjoyed it immensely. I even bravely fed the mouse and thought that it was kind of cute (EIPIX did not torture me too much!) Of course I will deny EVER saying a mouse was cute, lol! Lynxie sends lots of ‚ù§Ô∏èüíãüòò to the intrepid, fabulous and hard-working Dream Team Elite! Keep up the great work, and please also keep pestering BigFish to get Puppet Show updated. The more we annoy them, the more pressure they will have to do it! I cannot do it alone, although I really have tried! Please Dracyy, KimTwilight, Izzyoc, Opinion, Sunshine Susie, Deana M and Catalina, keep sending nasty emails to BigFish. A lot of people bought the game and it is unplayable! What will it take for ERS to finally update it?"
"14199",1142348885,"It's downright evil. Sad. Depressing."
"14200",1142366464,"Don‚Äôt buy it I hate it i got it cuz I love spongebob I thought he was my bf but I got the game and it sucked so bad theres nothing to do don‚Äôt buy it it‚Äôs a scam"
"14201",1142366464,"I thought this game was that you get to be in a spongebob Minecraft world but it was not and I think it is the worse please make the game better and don‚Äôt buy the game!!!!!!!!!"
"14202",1142366464,"This cheep knock off is not even a mod! You fling spongebob and his friends to the right. In my book that just spelled out B O R I N G !"
"14203",1142385805,"Good game. It reminds me of NiGHTS, and Yoshi's Island. Nice idea, cool gameplay. Challenging but fun. My biggest gripes are the abundance of ads, and the child. Let me explain. This game is like Yoshi's island in that if you're damaged, a ""child"" that is riding you gets thrown off, with a ten second timer to retrieve it. This would be fine, if the child was not constantly thrown ABOVE the screen, where you can't reach it. Once you go above-screen, however, it will throw you downwards, meaning you have even less of a chance. Another issue, though less pronounced, is that your power up will deactivate and immediately leave you exposed to the enemies were about to run into. At least there could be a few safety frames before being fed to the dogs?  Edit: Controls really aren't a problem. Hold the screen, you spin in one direction. Let go, spin in the other. Tap over and over, you'll go straight. It's simple unless you have such a bad sense of timing that you overshoot where you need to go. I have had very little problem with controls.  TL;DR, Many little glitches woven into a good idea. This if a complicated recommend, but if you're interested in playing the game, knock yourself out."
"14204",1142385805,"Controls are bad. Game wasn't that good to begin with but I like it a bit. I would expect more from padoga west. Cuz these are the developers of sonic mania here!"
"14205",1142385805,"Though it's not my favorite kind of game (the controls are a bit complicated‚Äînot my favorite), the picture/look of it, the color quality and the graphics are BEAUTIFUL! Great job!! I will definitely look for more of these amazing quality graphics games!"
"14206",1142578941,"Been playing this game for a couple of years now. Really fun and mindless entertainment. However, level 711 only gives you 2 moves! What‚Äôs up with that?? There‚Äôs no way to beat this level unless you buy a lot of moves. So I guess this is the end of the game for me..."
"14207",1142578941,"Level 711 allows only two moves?  Impossible with out buying a bunch of extra moves."
"14208",1142578941,"Love this Game omg stress free game"
"14209",1142657936,"Name is Spoofr but spoof it does not! Trail mapper would be more apt. It does NOT spoof your location so do not buy it for that."
"14210",1142657936,"Have to download a program on your computer and that process can take over an hour. Than you get nothing but error messages once you try to use it. Waste of money. Just emailed them for a full refund."
"14211",1142657936,"I just bought this app cause the pictures make it look easy then when you try to use it you discover a 15 set set up. Most of the sets involve setting up another app you have to get to make this one work. To top it all off I can't even find and English version of the app for iPhone which was what I bought this app for... So basicly I spent money to just delete this app and look for another... Thank you for that!!"
"14212",1142717730,"I loved the first two Cadenza games - great animation and music, and fun puzzles - but this one didn't do it for me. As others have mentioned, much too short. I only got a couple of hours of play out of the game and the bonus. Second, I didn't care for the mini-puzzles - either very same old, same old (shove the tiles around to make a picture), or too arcade-style for my taste, with an emphasis on fast reflexes more than being able to figure it out. Great voice acting and animation, but I'm really disappointed in the lack of imagination with this one."
"14213",1142717730,"Been playing these games for a while now and while many have a plot that is disjointed and have you running back and forth from screen 6 to screen 2 and back again, this one flows beautifully with a plot that makes you feel like you are part of the game. Good for all levels, mostly family friendly, as in no demons and such, but you do have to sucker punch someone and threaten with a gun.  No overt violence, and in the end, love wins. The music was not too ""jazzy"" (not a big fan), some mystery type music is thrown in, and a couple side things you can do while you're playing. Length of game is also good. A thoroughly enjoyable time!"

I wish there was a way to adjust how much of the filter you want to put on one picture. I was also kind of disappointed with the lack of other filters they had and the ability to adjust those. Was it worth $2 not really!"

"14224",1143258387,"The ads kill the game, it could be a decent little game but the ads make it terrible! I will never buy OT download anything from an ad ever! Removed them please. And no I will not pay to remove ads the game is not that good"
"14225",1143258387,"Difficult and not fun"
"14226",1143258387,"About once a minute, full screen ads that mimic other games appear, and can't be dismissed for several seconds. My kids got very frustrated at accidentally getting sent to the App Store over and over. Deleted immediately."
"14227",1143689829,"I can‚Äôt even complete a face and the app closes and anything I have done is gone. $.99?? For what?? It‚Äôs garbage"
"14228",1143689829,"Half of these faces and eyes etc don‚Äôt even look like me I try and try to adjust and I just can‚Äôt get right so I deleted it."
"14229",1143689829,"1)Does not let you make a copy, so if you get an emoji looking like someone just right but just want to change a feature (i.e holiday hat, etc) you have to create the emoji from scratch; 2) Developer does not answer emails; 3) App not updated in over a year"
"14230",1144018570,"Even after a year of a review this developer has not tried to fix the problem with the ads issue. Do not download if you don‚Äôt wanna have to watch a ad every 3 seconds."
"14231",1144018570,"Would be fun if I wasn‚Äôt watching an ad before I even got to play it once. Literally every time you fail you have to watch an extremely long ad."
"14232",1144018570,"I downloaded the game and pressed the screen to play like it said. It went straight to an ad. Not worth it for a second."
"14233",1144154105,"Beautiful but ridiculously frustrating and tedious. Touching any part of pretty much anything besides the level gate kills your character. Made it to level 2 and decided it wasn't worth the time."
"14234",1144154105,"This game is an undersea challenge in which you control your jellyfish character through dangerous caverns to reach keys that unlock higher levels, while collecting gems along the way. The game has potential to be an enjoyable little title, but has several issues hindering its success.  First, the intro to the game is a non-interactive animation.  You're visually shown what to do in the game, where instead you should be prompted to try the controls, and get a feel for the gameplay.  Once the animation is done, you're thrown into the first level with tap left/right instructions, and left to explore the level.  Normally, this type of introduction could work, but the one-life/start-over gameplay leads to frustration.  The level design suffers from what has been described in other reviews: the beginning stages are particularly difficult, taking numerous attempts to complete what should be simple, easy goals to build player confidence.  After your character (repeatedly) braves spiky walls to reach the level goal, you're presented with a key contained in smooth-looking semicircular ring, which you might expect to be a haven after all the effort required to reach that point.  But no, touch any part of the ring and it's start over (again).  It could make sense to add this level of difficulty at higher levels and introduce an additional challenge, but including this behavior in the first levels is a recipe for game deletion for all but the most dedicated players.  Enabling the character to take up three hits before having to start over would at least allow some planning to complete the level.  In terms of style, the game sports well-designed visuals, and the cute jellyfish character responds with the appropriate physics behavior.  The dubstep soundtrack isn't bad, but seems out of place given the undersea setting and the floating, undulating movement of your jellyfish.  Speaking of the character, you will unlock different jellyfish as you progress, but it's not clear whether the characters have any significantly different abilities, or are just style upgrades.  As it stands, Slip Away Mystify is fairly daunting out the gate and will likely appeal only to those seeking high difficulty challenges. Hopefully the developers can rethink the gameplay and level progression, but in its current state, it's difficult to recommend."
"14235",1144154105,"Too difficult. Fun for the first few levels. No check points so prepare to restart levels constantly. Not worth the money at all."
"14236",1144164707,"There isn‚Äôt any enemy variety and there should be some team abilities like in miitopia that I thought was a awesome detail.And there should be a WAR MACHINES like the bilista,catipalt,cannon,goloms,and lastly the legend told even to day the demon of the sky a dragon. Oh and more heroes and villains.Plus being able to buy or earn different weapons and armors for buffs and the armor would make your heroes/villains have more verity and to look cool.For example the swords would have strangeths and weakenesses.Like smaller swords would swing faster but do less damage or DPS,and heavier swords would do lots of damage but would take longer to swing.And if your lucky you can get weapons that have spells that could freeze enemies,or burn,splash damage,+5%gem chance,and if your wizard is a high enough level he could confuse enemies to attack there own team. Well this has been a fine dandy time but I have no more complaints for this game and add caricature interactions and friendship levels witch would effect your game play! Good bye all I‚Äôm out!!! Peace!"
"14237",1144164707,"The game is okay but I would like some more conversations. The game is addictive but it just keeps repeating over and over all the time when you prestige."
"14238",1144164707,"I‚Äôve played this game for quite a while after it launches, but then quit for a little bit.  It is a lot of fun and had a solid progression system, but after a few prestige resets it started getting too repetitive.  I have recently started playing some more on a regular basis and it is still pretty fun and a good idle time waster.  I also really enjoy the silly banter the characters talk to each other.   If you like idle progression games, give this a try."
"14239",1144247611,"Might be a decent game if it wasn‚Äôt for so many freaking ads. But as it is now, it wears thin super quickly. Uninstalled."
"14240",1144247611,"It was a fun game until it stoped working"
"14241",1144247611,"I've been waiting for a game like this M.A.G.A üá∫üá∏"
"14242",1144422536,"THIS GAME IS STILL AMAZING!!!! But it needs an update to get the ads to work for coins- and for the cloud to work...   AND IN THE UPDATE -IT WOULD REALLY HELP TO SEE THE ACHIEVEMENT LIST Like ‚ÄúHold three rubber duckies at once and get a prize‚Äù- AND MAYBE EXPAND THAT LIST- Ski safari made a MINT and an INFINITELY playable set of games doing just that- so I can replay to get achievements and use those to level up my stuff...  PLEASE CONSIDER AN UPDATE- I know you have the newer dolphin version- And That‚Äôs GREAT TOO- But this one can STAND ON ITS OWN as a Really Great Game... I WANT TO KEEP THEM BOTH- Please Consider..."
"14243",1144422536,"Great game but resets progress due to glitch"
"14244",1144422536,"Loved the first game on the windows phone and I want to love this one. But it‚Äôs frustrating when you get to a check point, watch an ad to progress and the game freezes. You have to force quit the app and it messes up the flow of the game. I would pay for no ads in this game."
"14245",1144446958,"Booo!! üëé"
"14246",1144446958,"Don't bother with this game. Period. ...You want to know why I say that? Fine. I was expecting nearly everything to be locked already, but this ""game"" shattered my expectations. For example, when dressing up the girls, it surprised me that the pants section is locked, so no matter what option you pick for the top, your character looks silly. This game needs more content unlocked by default to even make it a good demo. But it seems that this company just cares about milking as much money from parents as possible, so I expect it to stay exactly as is right now."
"14247",1144446958,"It was very bad I didn‚Äôt like it barley anything was open so u gat to fix this game I like roblox better than this"
"14248",1144458512,"I have had this app for over a year I believe. I would like to edit an event and the buttons aren‚Äôt working for EDIT, the X for exit, or the box with the arrow in the lower right corner for sharing. I have changed my screen protector, and even put a new one one. This is the only app that I‚Äôm having this issue with, with these options. This has been an issue for about 2 weeks. Please fix!!!"
"14249",1144458512,"I love this app and the simplicity of it but I wish when you edit an event you can customize the location so the date take its account the time zones. I‚Äôm leaving from Montana to New York and there‚Äôs a two hour time difference.

"14260",1145275343,"Yet another update that doesn't fix the game. The game won't even open!!! I paid $10 for this back when it worked. Then after an update it just refused to do anything. I want a refund!"
"14261",1145275343,"I won‚Äôt pay another $10 to buy this game because I switched to iPhone. I would appreciate if I could just play with the content I got when I bought the game but alas, all my hard work is locked behind a paywall."
"14262",1145275343,"I wrote a review complaining bc I paid $10 and didn‚Äôt get the updates for it but I‚Äôm re-writing this because just go click purchase again and instead of buying it again, click ‚Äúrestore purchase‚Äù and then you get your updates."

"14280",1145528262,"Over all, it is a great game. Their are some minor problems, but it after all is a funny thing to do."
"14281",1145541321,"OMG THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD. Like omg the puzzles in the beginning are fun and super simple but as the boards get bigerr they get much harder. I bet u cannot beat 7 boards on 5x5 for 30 seconds. This game is soooo much better than the original Flow Free. Flow Free Hexes is much better with its sleek design of the hexagonal board. And when I play it at night when my mom and dad think I‚Äôm sleeping the dark astatic is soo nice on the eyes and makes it nice and easy to play. My favorite part of the game is the adds that come up when I play. ‚ÄúCAN YOU BEET THIS GAME?!?!?!?!?!?‚Äù Adds are sooooooo funny and make me die every time Best game on the App Store!!!! I recommend to anyone who has played any of the other three in the series!!!!!!"

"14285",1145602670,"This game is an eye candy... As simple as it is, looks just amazing in the Apple TV! Now, the gameplay is a little confusing, even though the controllers are very responsive, the game itself is a little simple and repetitive... Played it for a few minutes, but didnt get hooked."
"14286",1145602670,"This game is crazy yet highly enticing one. Opening the app felt weird and hypnotizing due to the sound effect and black and weird background. The gameplay however is really addictive, balancing as many people as you can . You really have to concentrate to proceed further in this game as the challenges are interesting and also difficult. The balancing meter holds key the proceed further, concentrate on your balancing meter."

"14292",1145823552,"Really engaging game with brilliant AI. HOWEVER, that AI is way too slow. There's one piece where you need to play in a four player versus game. Waiting for the others to ""take their turns"" is just as annoying as waiting for humans to play. It takes so long, my iPad tries to sleep while I wait, even with the speed set to turbo. Three times I've played before bed and fallen asleep waiting for that particular board to play out. Other than that, it's truly a great, challenging game that's worth the money."

"14296",1145920150,"There were two levels in particular that took me literal weeks to figure out. 99 and the other was 72 or 49 or something idk they were SO hard. But so rewarding. Definitely play this game if you‚Äôre into flow, unblock me, Black, snappers, etc."
"14297",1145920150,"There is no trial of the game so you have to buy to play. Once you pass the tutorial there is no help or advise on how to play good luck getting past level 5.

"14298",1145920150,"As soon as I get almost solved, the app freezes. Has happened on the same puzzle three times. I really do not want to do that puzzle yet again. I will wait a bit for an update and if it isn‚Äôt fixed, I will uninstall,  I guess. It is a shame, but it is pointless to keep having it freeze two moves from completion."
"14299",1146128499,"I absolutely love this game EXCEPT, when I go to use endless mode the screen immediately goes black and goes back to the home screen! Is this game not compatible with iPhone XR or something? Anyway I love this game."

"14304",1146138135,"Awesome puzzles"
"14305",1146177222,"Really enjoy figuring out the puzzles. The sound and graphics are indeed soothing. The only problem is that when playing on the iPhone it can be quite difficult to turn the arrows"
"14306",1146177222,"Flud presents challenging puzzles with polished design and animation. Its grid-clearing concept bears some similarities with games like Mr. Square, Fold, and Blip Blup, but features its own unique mechanics.   The puzzles are well-crafted and satisfying to solve, striking a good balance between logical deduction and lateral thinking. The animations provide some nice eye-candy, but they're just slow enough to become an annoyance during play, as the UI stays completely unresponsive until after all the blocks have finished doing their dance. This means waiting several seconds every time you make or undo a move, which quickly grows tiresome as the levels become difficult.   The tiny navigation buttons can be hard to press on smaller devices. I've experienced occasional minor glitches, both with the graphics and placing arrows, but nothing that critically hindered play. The app does seem to use more CPU than necessary, battery drain has been an issue on my device.   However, all of these faults are overshadowed by the quality of the puzzles. Overall, Flud is a fun, challenging puzzler that could benefit from a few under-the-hood refinements to improve the user experience."
"14307",1146177222,"Is there seriously no way to turn off the SUPER annoying sound effects? Idk if I'll even get a chance to find out if I like the game as it bugs me so much. Not amused..."
"14308",1146274176,"I think this game is okay. It's not better than Pok√©mon go but it's an alternative to those who can't get Pok√©mon go. Those who are saying this is horrible, well why don't you try making a video game yourself and see if you could do better!"
"14309",1146274176,"stop this game"

"14317",1146543227,"Like a lot of people, I assumed that Procreate was the go-to drawing and painting app to use with my Apple pencil. But I really, really hate the way that Procreate handles its pencil brushes (feels totally unnatural to the point where its more frustrating to work with than anything).   This app is infinitely better. Pencils feel like pencils, and when you tilt your pencil to do some shading work, it actually responds the way you'd expect it to (unlike Procreate).   So glad I found this one."
"14318",1146543227,"I love this app it‚Äôs so good and plus it‚Äôs for free."
"14319",1146543227,"I've been using this app for several years, first on Android and now IOS. I purchased the premium for both and was very happy with what I had. The app got better with every update and I've recommended it to several friends and family. The only problem I've had so far, and recently, (that is of any significance) is that now I can't access the quick tool bar where the paintbrush and eraser, etc, access points are located. What happened was, I recently bought an iPhone XR and I accidentally moved the bar to underneath the slide up panel. It's only half on the screen and no longer accessible...I've tried to move it but the panel is fully covering it. Also, the undo and redo buttons are small and I had a difficult time attempting to use them, I kept tapping marks on my canvas. I hope this gets resolved soon, because unfortunately I'm no longer able to use the program without extreme limitations. Otherwise, this app is amazing and I definitely recommend you download it!"
"14320",1146552070,"So, I downloaded the game since it looked fun.  I spent 1-2 months on my main save getting to league 7 and buying 8 dogs. And guess what happened? The game deleted the save!  My iPad's storage is full, but that is no reason that the game deleted my save.  I hope the developers read this, because if this game keeps deleting saves like that, then its going to fail.  Can't wait to see this game die in a year or two. Maybe sooner."
"14321",1146552070,"Dog Sled Saga is a great game. It has good quality, and I really think you should get it. Only thing, the game freezes sometimes and I have to go back to the main page of my iPad and restart the game. Also, maybe some more dog breeds? Maybe Chiwawa, Pug, etc. Otherwise great game!!!!! Thx"
"14322",1146552070,"Supposedly, if you're children state they are too old for Dog Sled Saga then they are too old for your ""Fortnite church rules"".   While I don't like Fortnite for different reasons, hating Fortnite because it has ""weapons and violence"" in it is a lame way to think. Fortnite is the best and most appropriate ""shooting-game"" if anything. I'm also confused how they have access to Nerf guns if you dislike that too, unless that's already been ""banned"". There are many things a million times more disturbing than Fortnite. Give your poor kids a break and stop trying to act ""hollier than thou"" when in reality you sound like a total nut job and control-freak. Disgusting. üò¨"
"14323",1146601414,"Since it‚Äôs no longer run by OWN this game is ridiculous. The special games don‚Äôt add. Get an error message that I need to connect to the internet. Well, I am. I haven‚Äôt played the last several special games series for this reason.  I‚Äôve quit playing and will delete it. Maybe retry in a couple years."
"14324",1146601414,"Love this game but am sorry they have chosen to not continue releasing any more new levels.   Feel it is a unique game among so many that all feel and play the same.  Wish they would change decision to not continue releasing new levels."
"14325",1146601414,"Great game, but I‚Äôve finished level 25 over and over and it won‚Äôt let me advance to the next path. The ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù button is no help at all"

"14330",1146828763,"I have been playing this game for a while, and it is very fun. Just one problem... I have gotten to the point of having only the balls cheese, dirt, basket and eye left. But I had the suspicion that the game was repeating my purchases.  In other words, I received balls I already had. So I saved up about 2000 gems, enough to buy 20 balls, and NONE of the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù purchases landed on the four balls I didn‚Äôt have.  Soooo this should probably be fixed: it‚Äôs a problem..."

"14335",1146991999,"I know this app is rated for babies and toddlers. I'd say that's pretty accurate. For patient children, it would be good too. Not so much for my active 7 year old grandson. While he loves music, the time it takes to get the items to respond is too long for him. I purchased it hoping it would be a good program for him. Not so much. This program should not startle young children. It does play classical music while things slowly move on the screen. The listener controls the action by touching certain items. I did not no which ones to touch, so it is good for exploration."
"14336",1146991999,"My daughter is in love with this app. She can sit for a very long time, playing her favorites over and over. My husband and I are both classical musicians and we love the quality of the recordings and the chosen pieces. Thumbs up!"

"14347",1147297267,"I've played this game off and on for a couple years, but in this version, the graphics are so herky jerky that I get an instant headache from trying to play. It's an iPad Pro, so it's not a lack of horsepower."
"14348",1147297267,"Original don‚Äôt starve supports gamepad but this does not. I bought it because who woulda thought a newer game would abandon a key feature"
"14349",1147297267,"Don‚Äôt Starve is a great game, and even this DLC is virtually the same as the computer or console versions. However, this DLC only offers one game play mode, when you die, game over, begin again. Considering how long it take to move from island to island I personally feel this penalties is too harsh and prevents me from getting into the game.  Don‚Äôt starve app has a no sweat mode, why not this one?  Also I‚Äôd appreciate being able to use my Bluetooth controller, I can on Don‚Äôt Starve, but not here."
"14350",1147331964,"If you‚Äôve played XCOM2, this game is essentially that, minus the story. It even allows you to customize specifics of your campaign, so you can decide ‚Äòhow you want it to be difficult or easy.‚Äô This is good though, especially for mobile.  Its all mostly geared toward info collection and stealth. Hostile encounters are absolute: all shots hit, no one gets a health bar. This forces you carefully set the terms of each encounter ahead of it actually happening (ambushes, hacking, dones, etc.).  Perhaps, my one gripe is its light on info, especially when hacking targets. Its possible to hack something that looks hostile (red), but it doesn't appear to do anything if its not hacked, and doesn‚Äôt do anything after its hacked."
"14351",1147331964,"Failing and starting over has been designed into this game, just like Faster Than Light. I call that limited marketing vision. Otherwise, I love this game. It‚Äôs just that after about the 5th restart, it‚Äôs no longer fun. Just tedious. They‚Äôre leaving money on the table with this kind of game design, in my opinion, as not everybody considers countless restarts as enjoyable, especially the paying real money for the pleasure. Plus I don‚Äôt care for Desktop ports that are not ‚Äòreally‚Äô adopted for iOS. Using the mouse pointer Desktop icons, which are always too small, etc."
"14352",1147331964,"I really love the game. I just wish the game was iphone compatible. Some big strategy titles (such as Rome Total War and Civilizations) recently brought iphone support. Please consider the same. I would even pay again to have this game on my iphone."
"14353",1147424561,"This game is really fun but you guys should make the enemy players faster. Other than that I love it!!!"
"14354",1147424561,"I hate it when whenever I‚Äôm trying to download it it always stops and I have to delete everything just but I am adding game I don‚Äôt really like it"
"14355",1147424561,"This game has cool skins in all, but they don‚Äôt do anything while you are playing. Plus, the players aren‚Äôt even fast. SUPER ANNOYING!It is also really hard to aim to another receiver.If you just download this, delete it!Please fix this!!!"
"14356",1147432809,"Tempo control is tough on this because you only have one way... the apps way. Please add link or external tempo control! The more I use gadget and this synth I realize that korg needs to get on the audio unit bandwagon because I hate how taxing gadget can get when you really stack things up. They need to implement track freezing in that too! It would be great wouldn‚Äôt it. ü§™ As far as my review for this synth goes, it‚Äôs got awesome arpeggios and oscillators, but all the cool stuff is in the apps presets that sadly don‚Äôt get included in the gadget presets. Pick up an arpeggiator app like StepPolyArp or Rozeta sequencer suite and Aum until midi clock in is supported!"
"14357",1147432809,"Great sounding synth with sequencer for live use, but it‚Äôs not AUv3, which would allow me to record Midi into my favorite iOS Daw. It‚Äôs InterApp Audio though. Love the sequencer, great for lead sounds."
"14358",1147432809,"I play the bass so I‚Äôve got an ear for a really good sounding bass ‚Ä¶this particular device gives me a lot to choose from ‚Ä¶as far as different tones and I don‚Äôt get calluses on my fingers I love it ha ha ha ha I just love it"
"14359",1147452760,"I love all Easy Tech Titles thoroughly and this is one of my favorites. The ability to bring generals through different eras is spectacular and I love the concept. The difficulty does get ridiculous (I‚Äôm in the Discovery Age), but the game is fun nonetheless. Thank you Easy tech for adding support for the latest IOS devices. I was pleasantly surprised to see the full screen be used."
"14360",1147452760,"I love this game so much and I‚Äôm now playing it everyday but I‚Äôm stuck on the 1ST Joan of Arc level. It‚Äôs basically impossible since the English archer men with generals do 1000 dmg. Even if I use the George Washington guy I bought it‚Äôs still impossible to win for me."
"14361",1147452760,"My only problems are that some of the games take forever to be honest I don‚Äôt think I finished a conquest just because they take forever. I would play this game a lot more if all the conquests will unlocked at the beginning of the game. Just like a lot of your games you have to complete the hole campaign just to do the conquests but in my opinion it‚Äôs still a fun game."
"14362",1147863312,"Tried to run game 4 times on iPhone 6 - app would close. What a game-huh?"

"14371",1148046351,"Crashes often, but what I found unacceptable is they don't include Pluto in our solar system and I'll be darned if I will allow my kids to be taught wrong information.  Neptune is not the furthest planet in our solar system."
"14372",1148046351,"I've deleted and downloaded this app three times to see if it would fix itself, but it doesn't. It crashes every time you push a button to learn more about a planet. Our iPad is even running iOS 9.3.3 and the specs say you only need iOS 8 or later. I will be asking for my money back."
"14373",1148046351,"I downloaded this game for my 6yr old son.  App downloads fine, but crashes EVERYTIME it opens and renders app useless.  Very frustrating for a 6 yr old.  Don't waste your time or money!"
"14374",1148047801,"I played (and continue to play) Siralim 1 and had a blast with it; one of the things I really appreciated was that it's one of the few in-depth games my old iPad can run without any problems. Needless to say I was psyched about this game, especially because it looks like they fleshed out the spellcasting system a lot (creatures can cast spells now with indvidual stats, and you don't have to worry about running out of charges on your best scroll and having to search for more scrolls once that happens) and made character class have more of an impact-- not to mention the various quirky gods (the god of anger who always cusses at you might be my favorite so far, though it's a close call between him and the creepy/flirty spider goddess of poison). However, one problem: the game has a very annoying tendency to crash when someone (either me or my opponent) casts a spell in combat. I'm still giving it 3 stars because it looks like they tried to take some measures to fix it, with options letting the game run more smoothly on lower-quality devices, and it's nice that they're showing consideration for players like me who don't have the newest devices; also, it seems like it would be a lot of fun if it didn't do that every time. Maybe add an option kind of like Turbo Mode but that only disables spell graphics or something, not all combat information? I don't know. Looking forward to playing this when they get the bugs ironed out."
"14375",1148047801,"I love this game a lot, had 100+ hours on my main save before I took a break for a while. Now that I‚Äôm finally getting back into it, I can‚Äôt remember what it was I was working on with my builds and such since I didn‚Äôt bother to record my plans anywhere...  It‚Äôs super fun to plow through levels while earning more reputation with the various Gods, at least, though I also don‚Äôt remember who I really needed to rank up and what items or materials I really needed to get to unlock further bonus features and such. :P  All I know is that I can slaughter the enemies in Daily Realms and everything no problem, but with the sigils, it tends to be the exact opposite, lol. And the last Task in my current set for the fortune teller requires me to beat a level 5+ Primal sigils... (I had to check the library to remember what Tasks were and a bunch of other stuff, so I‚Äôm thankful that‚Äôs there, maybe I need to read more of that to figure out more strategies and stuff, or just start putting more time into one of my NG+ saves with some of the ‚Äúcheats‚Äù active to help me out a bit more, lol.)"
"14376",1148047801,"Such an awesome game. I rarely find a game I can put that much time in to... I put about the same amount of time in to the first one. Can't wait for siralim 3 for iOS!!!"
"14377",1148053146,"This game is so cool I love the graphics and the controls are spot on. It‚Äôs also a real challenge which is rare to find in an adventure game. It‚Äôs like Mario and Undertale combined!"
"14378",1148053146,"iPhone X controls are too close to the edge of the screen"
"14379",1148053146,"When I started playing this it was fun at first but after awhile sometimes I have to take rage quits."
"14380",1148119410,"After playing Taylor‚Äôs three adventures this one is kind of a let down. The main character is quite unlikable and it doesn‚Äôt always follow your choices so it seems like the story is taking you where it wants instead of you choosing the path. The story is interesting but since the character annoys the heck out of you, you find yourself ignoring it."
"14381",1148119410,"The story twists and turns in many unexpected ways and is what makes this such a great app. I would definitely recommend this app. The millions of paths can be reviled with a simple click of a button."
"14382",1148119410,"I love these games but now that I have the series 4 Apple Watch this doesn‚Äôt even work it just says launch app on iPhone to start I‚Äôve tried deleting and redownloading but nothing‚Äôs working please fix I just paid for this. And these games are amazing"
"14383",1148138918,"Truly original storyline. A little rough to follow I have to be honest. I have played thousands of these games so finding an original storyline gets big props even if it is a little strange and tough to follow at times. This game at least sticks out of the pack and I will remember it. I do like that, so I would recommend it on that fact alone."
"14384",1148138918,"Unlike most of the games, this one is worth the cost.  Challenging mini games, long enough to feel like it is worth the cost."
"14385",1148138918,"Hi, Izzyoc! I wish I had seen your review but today our XFinity was down for 5 hours so TV was out of the question! I have nothing else new to play so I guess for the price I'll try it. By the way, do you have any idea when some of the games you listed will be released for iPad? I can't wait for a new Expedition; it's one of my favorites. Thank you so much for all of your input! I actually liked this game a lot more than I thought! First of all, you could customize the settings. Orneon actually gives us a journal, a feature sorely lacking by other developers. The game was lengthy, with a bonus adventure. The storyline wasn't overly complicated, or even really unusual. Still I liked it because I had no trouble following it. Objectives were regularly updated.The graphics were incredibly colorful and gorgeous, and the cut-scenes were electrifying, especially when you use the magic lamp and enter the time portal. Loading was instantaneous between locations and and there was a marked, if so customized, teleport map to transport you. There was no map in the bonus adventure, but I don't know why that was the case. Inventory was labeled and interactive. There was a lot to do at each location. You also had a neat device to use to dispel evil magic. Collectibles included flowers and morphing objects. The HO scenes had variation and some were more like puzzles. The puzzles/mini-games were diverse: there was some boring rotational stuff, some games of skill, some coding puzzles, but at least there were many puzzles and there was something for everyone. I was very happy not to deal with any major rodents! Thank you, Dracyy! I deducted a star for the following reasons: I found that some of the puzzles were very hard to manipulate, although the game ran smoothly otherwise. I didn't like the hint system because it was a spoiler. Lastly, with such magnificent graphics, we were not given any gorgeous wallpapers in the extras section, and I would have loved them! This was still a good game and I would definitely enjoy another sequel. I would like to say Happy Thanksgiving to the entire DTE and the other gamers/reviewers as well!

"14386",1148177808,"When i got the app i couldnt watch it and when i tried joining fans everything went gray.i would have picked 1 star but i didn‚Äôt feel like it so i put 2 stars"
"14387",1148177808,"This is a really good idea, but I would like to see all or at least most of the games on the fox sports go app, specifically NFL, MLB, and NHL. If you can include that, I would gladly rate it a 5 star. Please make this update fox sports!!!!"
"14388",1148177808,"The app overall is wonderful. It works well with and without a cardboard headset. However there needs to be a bigger variety in sports and more current games. A way to show more interesting topics is by allowing us to choose our teams that we want to watch. If these all happen I‚Äôd without a doubt give this an instant five stars"

"14397",1148321705,"Played this game years back first on ps2,then on the Xbox 360, been my favorite game ever since. Nothing has ever even compared to bully. Now I‚Äôm able to play my favorite game on the go on the phone! Never thought I‚Äôd see the day were our technology has advanced so much that we can now play console games on our phones. I remember thinking this years back that I wish I could play bully always on the go, and now here we are and we can! Thanks rockstar for making such an awesome game available on the mobile format!!! 5 Stars!!!"

"14400",1148362520,"It looks like they went back and sharpened all the graphics. The gameplay is even smoother and the added ability to post to Facebook is awesome. I love this game! Ya gotta hide it!"
"14401",1148364175,"This app is a HUGE life saver for my Business! I use it daily...UP UNTIL THE LAST 11 days. Our prices have changed for our products BUT the app hasn't updated. SUPER disappointing"
"14402",1148364175,"Great app overall but the zipcodes for 93065 is incorrect. I pay $1.99 per month for zipcodes and I found few wrong ones already. Also, Can you add $45 kit to new consultant category, similar to what you have for new PC. Thanks so much!!"
"14403",1148364175,"This is the worst app I‚Äôve ever used. When touching the options, I have to tap about 1/2 inch above the actual tab I need. Today, I cannot even select a state and it keeps asking me to purchase the zip code for an extra 20.00. I‚Äôd like a full refund on this app. I‚Äôve tried the support tab and I get redirected to Facebook."
"14404",1148587239,"I give this one star because I cannot play the game anymore.  I go into the app and it automatically freezes and doesn‚Äôt unfreeze. I use yo give this app 5 stars neutrality this changed my mind. The school bus doesn‚Äôt even come Anymore . Can you guys fix my problems?"
"14405",1148587239,"Awesome!"
"14406",1148587239,"I love playing My Town Preschool because it is so so much fun.I LOVE IT."
"14407",1148979232,"This app will display ads that will sow in appropriate images. Clicking on the ads will lead your child to a click bait rabbit hole filled with deeper and deeper debauchery.   Great job developers!"
"14408",1148979232,"It‚Äôs amazing to see when a developer and his/her team makes an adorable, challenging, non-cliche game.  There‚Äôs plenty of games that copy the original, but you guys, just made something completely new! I don‚Äôt see anyone copying you guys!  You all serve good challenges! (Lets hope in World A I pass lvl. 8 :3) All you characters are adorable, and the physics are pretty lit!  The best part?  You all keep things nice and simple, it‚Äôs not too dull, neither is it too complex.  It‚Äôs like you made the perfect porridge for Goldilocks! (Lets call her Saorilocks!)  I enjoy playing this game, and will always play.  You have my thumbs up if I were decide you to be game of the year!"

"14413",1149338810,"Some clearly wrong answers and you need to know most conventions.  A lot of conventions are great for experienced players/partnerships.  But if you're that, you don't need the app."
"14414",1149338810,"I agree that this is a good way to learn, but there are errors in the quizzes , and the answer does depend on unknown systems occasionally. Good to do the quizzes with a partner. That way both of you understand the lesson."

"14418",1149476118,"The game is refusing to give me a hint beyond telling me which room to be in, after escaping the locked cell in the jail. I have exhausted what I know to do there, so I am wondering if there is a bug? Loved it up to this point."

In addition, Domini Games plans on porting new games to iOS in the upcoming year. Sign up for their newsletter! This game was adorable and colorful. It was a cute, sentimental story.

"14424",1149500619,"The app asks you to rate the game. If you choose 3 or less stars it does nothing. 4 or more and it sends you to the App Store. I thought Apple banned this practice. Consider rating the game 1 star until they change this unethical review fixing practice."

"14492",1152607698,"Like the other game I liked . Frustrating and addictive."
"14493",1152607698,"For the first few levels, I thought this was a great game, totally worth the $.99 in app purchase to get rid of ads. But then, the developer made several typical mistakes that made me drastically lower my rating and eventually delete the game.  First after maybe 20 minutes of easy levels suddenly becomes impossible. It could get much too hard, and playing the same level, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again it‚Äôs tedious, not fun. And then it gets even worse, as even if you played over and over that many times they‚Äôre just not solvable. Soon I discovered why this was‚Ä¶  I tried tapping on the next level, since there was a level that I clearly was never going to get past even if I replayed it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again 1 million times, and I was told I had to watch three videos to get to play the next level. Well, having paid money for the game, I object to having to watch videos, especially several of them in a row, but in this case I said OK.  Well, here the developer got greedy, because I watched a video after video after video, way more than 3, and it wouldn‚Äôt ever let me play that next level. After watching seven videos I gave up and deleted the app. Giving 2 stars instead of one because I did have about 15 minutes of fun playing it. Too bad the developer blew it... this could‚Äôve been really great, five star game."
"14494",1152611696,"Colors are very true."
"14495",1152611696,"love it"
"14496",1152611696,"Very little amount of wallpapers and there are free apps that do the same thing as this paid app."
"14497",1152657123,"This app has so much potential to be great but it is constantly glitching and is very hard to navigate. I personally think there are better period trackers out there. I have to delete this app and redownload it about every 2 months because it stops working."
"14498",1152657123,"I had read reviews about all the bugs and glitches, but gave the app a chance anyway. It was great at first, but eventually, just like other reviews stated, it stopped working. I can‚Äôt log any symptoms and it does not predict my cycle accurately. Not even close. The only thing I can do with it now is mark the start and end date of my period, but I can also do that on any regular calendar. Not sure what I paid for if it doesn‚Äôt even work. Disappointed."
"14499",1152657123,"It annoys me that I paid for this app yet it continually tracks my period wrong. My cycle is almost exactly 4 weeks on the dot every month. All of a sudden it shows my cycle as being 3 weeks long. Extremely unhelpful when trying to track ovulation or anything really."

"14502",1153025759,"Cool"
"14503",1153028211,"These demon rise games beat almost every other tbs game. Freemium, one time, and one time with in app purchases.  If you min/max you will have to raise the difficulty as your party gets incredibly strong once you‚Äôve got ability point generation and damage for auto attackers.   But the story is ok. The champions are great and you know what you‚Äôre getting.  You‚Äôll get about 10 hours out of this if you grind, which is not necessary for normal difficulty. But it‚Äôs a good 10 hours with replay ability. It‚Äôs not FF tactics but there‚Äôs only one game in the App Store that is, that‚Äôs more expensive and most of us have already owned it twice.  Highly recommend and will keep looking for Demons Rise 3 or other titles. I know there‚Äôs a new one and I didn‚Äôt fancy the way it looked, but having playing this again I‚Äôm going to take another look"
"14504",1153028211,"I enjoy this game so very much! Great time consumer! As every other customer/reviewer, I have just a few requests. Only two though! One: would you mind making the maps just a bit bigger because with that many heroes and enemies on screen it can get kind of tight. Two: could you maybe add just a few more character to help finish off some of the heroes collections I already have, if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt mind that is. At least on giant female character would be cool like some elephant lady god or something cool idk, and one smaller deadly character like a red cap or an imp or deadly gnome or something. Other than that keep up the awesome work because I love it when devs update regularly so keep it up! Oh and thank you!  UPDATE: okay I finally thought of something, can y‚Äôall add a Banshee, a powerful poltergeist, evil butcher (with like a huge cleaver), musketeer black dwarf with a spawnable cannon. Thanks and keep up the good work!"
"14505",1153028211,"There is potential for something amazing in this game but I don‚Äôt know if the devs are ever going to pursue it. The mechanics are good but the maps are small. It would be great to see some open maps with options. Also wish they would‚Äôve changed some things from the first game. They switched the characters and optimized some interface but it‚Äôs almost exactly the same. Not even sure why there is a ‚Äúworld map‚Äù when you can‚Äôt do anything four read about a place that you will never visit in game. I hope there is an update for it and we get to play more campaigns."
"14506",1153109870,"I wanted to give it a four or even five for the great idea sadly it is almost solely in what I assume to be chinese. Pity really I can not understand almost everything and to recommend it would be a mistake if I can read what a flower is all in all it‚Äôs not a bad app (I think) just lost through translation I guess add more languages will be the real growth here"
"14507",1153109870,"easy to use,very practicle when in spring every blossom seems so fresh and needs to beintroduced, just one suggestion: how come there's no sharing button on the result page? it would be much more convenient!"
"14508",1153109870,"0/10 Would Not Download Again"
"14509",1153136025,"I love this game! It's hard buy addicting! I highly recommend this! If your board or something it's perfect but make sure you have a lot of time on your hands because when you start you won't stop!"
"14510",1153136025,"The gameplay of this app is fairly decent, HOWEVER, every single time you fall off the side, you have to either watch a video, or pay actual money for coins in order to continue the game! After one or two times of doing that, and you'll be doing exactly what I did...DELETING!!!"
"14511",1153136025,"Pros:  This app has gorgeous graphics and music, plus simple controls (one touch and timing based). Can't stress graphics enough.  Cons:  Prize wheel only gives blue scarfs (despite the fact that supposedly all scarfs can be won). Also, when a new scarf is bought (for plenty of in-game coins), it's usable, but when switched to another scarf it's not available. Another thing: quality of screenshots from the ""share"" section is crap (and in the latest version, screenshots can only be shared to facebook or twitter).  Honestly, as soon as these problems are fixed the game will be pretty much perfect. Unfortunately, I can't give 5 stars because  of these cons."
"14512",1153449735,"I love this game so much. It‚Äôs relaxing and helps relieve my anxiety. It brings my mood up and is such a wonderful game. It would be cool if after you‚Äôre all maxed out you can make like a little farm and decorate it with items you earn in a mini game or something!"
"14513",1153449735,"I love this game soooo much. I rarely write reviews for games so if y‚Äôall got me this far, you should be impressed. I regret writing one review, but this one I‚Äôm proud of right now! I wish you could make it where you can make different games so you can keep playing one you‚Äôve completed, and start a new one with different pigs with different personalities! I love this game though! Keep up the good work! Btw, this game is so stinking cute! üêñ üê∑ üêΩ ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"14514",1153449735,"Never my life have I become so attached to a pig. This is a great game and it‚Äôs super cute they also don‚Äôt have any micro transactions so that‚Äôs a huge plus tho there are ads but there not too bad !! So please adopt this pig <3"

"14518",1153694100,"At first I was reluctant to buy the game but I was drawn to the graphics because of the similar super Mario world art direction. But What i really like about the game is the hunt for items which Require a little bit of strategy but all together its fun, not too long and enjoyable."
"14519",1153694100,"It was very puzzling at first, but once I got the hang of it, I real enjoyed the game. The only negative thing was that it didn‚Äôt need to be 2.99"
"14520",1153694100,"I enjoyed ‚ÄúTraps n‚Äô Gemstones‚Äù but this one is too hard and unforgiving for me. It‚Äôs classic Mario-like platformer including the tedious go back to start when you die. It‚Äôs just too tedious to be fun. I wish there was an easy mode."
"14521",1153883316,"Great relaxing game"

"14525",1153896723,"The main characters are just the ice climbers"
"14526",1153896723,"I thought the idea was clever and good. Until I went to the cat challenge and I‚Äôm currently stuck on level 7! Platforms In this level get way too small and it gets increasingly unfair. And if you screw up too many times? AD! Boring. Not a good way to kill time. I think the art design and the design of the characters are good. But the controls are AWFUL! Ultimately, I will not be touching this game for a while."

"14530",1154282030,"I really like Cosmo. He‚Äôs pretty cool. A few things I didn‚Äôt know before we bought him   He has to be connected to a smart device or he will not work at all. That means he does not go off and do things on his own like the commercials showed or at least alluded to.   He can‚Äôt hear you. No mics.  He has a hard time seeing without bright lights or the sun.   How come you can have an explore feature for him. He will only go near his blocks but won‚Äôt venture much further than that.   I know you have a second version coming out but I think you can add some features to Cosmo to try to emulate some of the new features that Vector will have.  Keeps disconnecting and now no support."

None of the in-app icons function when tapped. I would buy this app outright (NOT on a monthly fee obligation) but it won't let me do anything. Any help out there?"

We were taking a road trip to see her grandparents and she was so excited to get this new app to play on the way.

After the tutorial, you‚Äôre given a time frame( which is around 3mins or so) on your first mission to complete the said objectives. Racing against the clock in an ARPG? Not sure about others, but I‚Äôm not a fan. If however, the clock was used for recording which specified and how many objectives could get completed in an allotted amount of time( as such in other ARPGs like Kritika), the game would improve significantly. Other then all that I see what others reviews say about gameplay, the gameplay is nothing to argue about. Thx ;)"

"14582",1156258040,"This is a very good game and I wish I could play all the episodes and the graphics are amazing it makes the game more realistic and just overall fun to play I hope people give this a good review because this is the best telltale series"
"14583",1156258040,"Overall the app is okay I do think it‚Äôs sluggish and not too fast and can be glitchy and buggy but I love the plot line definitely had me wanting to play more it could just use better graphics and I would continue playing this game if it was free or at least had the option to watch ads to get more episodes or something so i can keep playing without having to pay I would definitely use this app more"
"14584",1156447726,"This game is cute and adorable. But the ADDS OH MY GOSH!! When it says I can redo the contest I usually didn‚Äôt watch the add. BUT THEN IT GIVES ME A ADD ANYWAY WITH NO AWARD!!!ü§¨ And before I even started I got a add! The adds ruin it. And I deleted the game because of it, if not a lot of adds existed I would be fine. But they ruin it.... ü•∫üò°üò°üò°"
"14585",1156447726,"First of all I really recommend this game it is so fun to play and I don't even care if I have to buy stuff. I'm not going to buy stuff. But it doesn't matter. I love it!! Coco I love your games and I recommend on doing a game on motor sickles (that girls compete with boys on a race on motor sickles) Bye!"
"14586",1156447726,"I really like this game beacause I love to bake"
"14587",1156704617,"This game is definitely fun and a quick play. It‚Äôs a good pick up game that you can enjoy but it is limited. Obviously the developer wants you to buy the upgrades and spend money but it is a little bit ridiculous. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying a few dollars for a full game with all the modes unlocked but the developer clearly doesn‚Äôt want to do this. They want to drain the consumer and that makes the consumer spend no money within the app. Seriously make an affordable 2-3 dollar option to unlock every mode and people will invest!"
"14588",1156704617,"It's free and it's fun"
"14589",1156704617,"It crashes sometimes but that really rare ..it doesn't lag or nothing it's hella fun ... u don't need to use the internet or wifi to play üòÇ get the game it's fun. plus why not?"
"14590",1156856246,"This game is pretty cool. Its very hard once you get to the 10,000 meter line. Although the game is very fun, it can be kind of laggy. If you want to play it on the VR set, do these. ‚Ä¢ Get an iPhone ‚Ä¢ Get a Virtual Reality/ VR set ‚Ä¢ Download the App ‚Ä¢ Slide the slot from the VR set and put your phone in it. ‚Ä¢ Slide it back in and put on the set on your head ‚Ä¢ Play a very fun game You can turn/shift your head to turn the bike so that it will avoid the cars - Main Objective- : Try not to touch the cars and avoid them   The more meters you go, the more money you get This is a very fun game and I suggest you try it out!! :)"
"14591",1156856246,"Simple and fun. Thanks!"
"14592",1156856246,"Very fun"
"14593",1156875272,"It‚Äôs in English and if works."
"14594",1156875272,"A few issues with the app.  1. You need to be literate in Japanese to sign up for a new account.  2. It asks for a Japanese zip code but you can use any random valid zip in Japan  3. Changing password doesn‚Äôt result in re-authentication.  Face ID continues to work between password change.  Not sure what‚Äôs going on....  4. It appears to store your password in plain text.  It shows your password in plain text when you perform a password change.  To confirm...  5. Password reset requires you to essentially re-supply all the info you provided during sign up.   The UI is an ugly form back for 90s....  6. Password reset requires a manual verification by some person.  It‚Äôs not fully automated.    Overall, ok once it works but the app is a nightmare to setup and troubleshoot."
"14595",1156875272,"I could not sign up because I have no zip code in Japan."
"14596",1156906605,"This is insane. Don't download"
"14597",1156906605,"This game is so fun and good me and my sister love playing this game!! üíñü¶Ñ"
"14598",1156906605,"This is ridiculous they literally force ads DURING a game. Within my first game I saw two forced video ads...it pauses the game to show ads. I've never deleted an app so fast"
"14599",1157479274,"It should be explained better in game"
"14600",1157479274,"Clunky and full of ads. Poor controls and no tutorial or instructions. Zero stars."
"14601",1157479274,"Great game, but the tanks prefer the term ""beefy"" to the term chunky, as chunky is a degrading term referring to anything from bad turkey to a bowel movement, which coincidentally may have been the bad turkey. I am not mad, just disappointed that you are not taking the inanimate objects' feelings into account as their god and creator. Great game regardless."
"14602",1157494807,"Lovely activity app. Gives sharing adults some quality time with kids and lots of vocubulary building opportunities. I would definately reccommend this to ESL teachers."
"14603",1157494807,"It just crashed twice in a row. The game seemed interactive enough--picking parts for a robot and coloring a bear for example, but then the crashing started."
"14604",1157494807,"When you sweep up the shop, sometimes it's impossible to get in those areas"
"14605",1157626465,"Fun, but where is the uncensored version??"
"14606",1157626465,"The game is very fun to play but it would be nice to play the uncensored version of the game."
"14607",1157626465,"It's a fun game but censorship as dulled it quite a bit."
"14608",1157626939,"Fun game however when it went back to the main screen and tried to press the play button the screen would pause , and keep going back to the home screen on my cell. When I would open the screens that are open it shows that an add popped up on the game , but there wasn't when I clicked on the play button. The game though my child loves."
"14609",1157626939,"Yes"

"14617",1158667565,"I did not like itü§¨ü§¨üëøüñ§üíî"
"14618",1158667565,"It‚Äôs not the best game in the world. I don‚Äôt like doing it. It‚Äôs not addicting at all. I could just do it in real life at home.üòíüòíüòíüòíüòí"
"14619",1158667565,"Honestly I don‚Äôt like the game but I gave it two ‚≠êÔ∏è because it‚Äôs more fun if you flip the bottle in real life the game it‚Äôs just a one tap then ‚úÖ done if the game would be upgraded I suggest that you let the game not only bottle but lots of games in 1game  and thanks üôè"

"14625",1159035153,"I love this game and yah but I don‚Äôt like how the huge pineapple takes like 7 to 8 hours to get another one but also idk this is just a fun game"
"14626",1159072426,"The game is very fun to play and relaxing at times but there are some minor bugs that take a while to fix and even now I still don‚Äôt know how I managed to get them to stop"
"14627",1159072426,"This is a good game I just have a couple problems with it. My fist problem with it is that it is a HUGE battery drainer. I cannot tell you how many times I‚Äôve played this game, and then have my phone die because of the game. (I personally think it‚Äôs because of the background. If there was a low power mode for the game, I would have that thing on 24/7. This really does turn me off from playing the game. Another problem I have with the game is that you either have to be actively playing the game or close the app completely. The game takes no time to start and loud. I just find it inconvenient to close the app for the train to move. I personally like to keep them open so I can get to them later quickly. But this is not possible with this game. Another con about having to be active or closed is that if you do leave the app open but are not actively playing, the train does not move. This happens way to often and is very frustrating to me. If I were to be nitpicking, I could also say that the lights in factories and depots don‚Äôt match (as in the lights just flout and have no source) but this is not problem in any way gameplay wise. Other than these few (semi big) flaws, the game is great and as a random stranger to you, I do recommend you play this game."
"14628",1159072426,"Just get it"
"14629",1159218681,"Overall I like the app but it has some functionality problems. On iPhone SE running iOS 11.3, the app does not line up in the screen. The 30 second skip function goes the opposite direction or to random times in the podcast. I can‚Äôt listen to live shows. When I press play on a podcast, nothing happens. When I reopen the app the resume a podcast, it starts over. Etc. etc. Would be great to get an update to fix all of this."
"14630",1159218681,"Awesome works as it should but when I try to skip through with the button it just goes to random parts of the podcast"
"14631",1159218681,"Heard from a friend how awesome the podcast is, so I downloaded the app after paying for it. And it just will not load anything an after a few seconds it will shut off, an go back to my home screen."
"14632",1159273771,"This game keeps crashing. Why????"
"14633",1159273771,"My game is not working I have the car the first car all level and now I have to buy a truck I have the money but when I try to unlock it doesn‚Äôt so what‚Äôs the matter with this game"
"14634",1159273771,"This game is unplayable and is trash"
"14635",1159290179,"The game would be really fun to play , if you could actually move. I shouldn‚Äôt have to press and swipe so hard I nearly break the screen just to jump up to a high level or wall vault."
"14636",1159290179,"What‚Äôs the actual difference between vector 2 and vector 2 premium version"
"14637",1159290179,"The first game was great. I finished every level with 3 stars but when the second game came out i was hyped so i bought the premium version and its a waste of money the first one was so much better this game is just terrible."
"14638",1159410526,"I‚Äôm really disappointed that there are not snake and cupcake emojis."
"14639",1159410526,"I purchased this a while back on my iPhone 6 plus when I got the iPhone 8 plus it never restored to my new phone how can I get them back"
"14640",1159410526,"Can you make a emoji app for Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and LeBron James"
"14641",1159611436,"My kids love it I can get stuff done without them üêú bugging me it's just really helps"
"14642",1159611436,"I couldn't have expected this game to be so enjoyable, but it keeps getting more challenging and more interesting with each slight increase in difficulty and new trap. I keep coming back to it time and again, something very few iOS games manage to pull off."
"14643",1159611436,"Wow, so much fun and so very simple. At each new kill type you have to relearn the best way to use it. Game stops at level 100 though. Please add more levels."
"14644",1160056295,"Lol"

"14648",1160380201,"This game is so amazing. I love this game so much you don‚Äôt even know , I‚Äôm so addicted I‚Äôm on level #68,446 . ITS SUCH A GOOD GAME , and I do the shape thingy in atleast 5 seconds , I don‚Äôt know I feel like this game teaches me a lot lol :))"
"14649",1160380201,"The only downside I have to this app is that it doesn‚Äôt save your progress. I got this app and played 40 some levels and it crashed and when I went back into it I was at level one and could not go back to the level I was at. And now every time I close the app and go back into it my progress restarts without the option for me to go back to where I was"
"14650",1160495350,"This game is a lot of fun. The hints are better than in some games because they are more direct"
"14651",1160495350,"Not one of my favorites"
"14652",1160495350,"Awesome game!! Good hos, puzzles, character interactions, storyline, etc."
"14653",1160574357,"This is actually a great one! simpler system, but requires more techniques to play well. The simulated rules of a store are much more real. I played most of their games and love this one too."
"14654",1160574357,"You get 5 stars every game for the sole fact of being a company who hasn't abandoned a full game for money.  Pay to win has killed the gaming world, yet you stick to your roots.  Bravo Kairosoft"
"14655",1160574357,"I love this company‚Äôs ideas so much and I was looking forward to this game so badly, but they missed the mark completely. The tutorial poorly explains the game and there‚Äôs little to no control over what happens. Everything from sales to finding items is random and it doesn‚Äôt completely make sense to me I‚Äôm super sad because I love economy/shop based games. Huge disappointment üòî"
"14656",1160688144,"This game is awesome for babies but please give a better reason for an ambulance, and that girl who fell off of it I‚Äôm sure she wouldn‚Äôt have to go to the hospital, but otherwise this game is great and I really enjoyed it!"

Me and my sister hope you can make everything free. Me and Mackanize‚Äôs birthday are on the same exact day and people can‚Äôt tell which twin is which cuz we wear the same outfits all the time.

"14658",1160688144,"I love how you got all your stuff together"
"14659",1160690385,"So I bought the ad free in-app purchase but still get those pesky banners at the bottom. What‚Äôs more the banners COVER UP THE MENU at the bottom so I can‚Äôt play the game at all.  $2.99 wasted."
"14660",1160690385,"None Ads plz"
"14661",1160690385,"I love it it has wizards anime lol"
"14662",1160723843,"The game is great but you need to reduce the ads to play after every 4 th board not after every one thx"
"14663",1160723843,"Love the Game.  iPhone X support PLEASE"
"14664",1160723843,"Great game"
"14665",1160731868,"This is what mobile games should be."
"14666",1160731868,"The stained glass art is unique and stunning. Excellent story line."
"14667",1160731868,"Wow! First day the game is available, and I can't even play it! The screen is blank, and then kicks me out. My iPad meets all the requirements. I deleted it, and downloaded again -- to no avail. They charge $2.99 for a game that doesn't even work! Way to go Mangatar! Real score zero stars, but Apple makes you give one. Fix it!"
"14668",1160751111,"I like to listen to beat matched music all the time."
"14669",1160751111,"Simple, sweet, user, friendly."
"14670",1160751111,"Great app. But make it the same for all devices. For example when you set up cue points on the iPad then you go on the MacBook there in different slots.  Also you can‚Äôt name the cue points on the iPad."
"14671",1161122860,"Here is another great game from Game Stew. Keep up the great work Devs!"
"14672",1161122860,"Fun"
"14673",1161122860,"First of all i love Game Stew, and i really hope someone read this. The power ups arent really power up, the magnet just send your ball to a random location and when it sticks to you time still passes, also power ups bounce the ball back, i already lost a level because the ball bounced away from the enemy in a magnet thing. In some levels the enemy is one-two blocks away, making it almost impossible to properly control your guy. But its should be fun! It looks fun! Maybe an option to disable the magnet would make the game better? Please consider that. With love, a fan"
"14674",1161175470,"Two screens and two objects all the buttons disappear and don‚Äôt come back. On top of language issue."
"14675",1161175470,"In many of these games, knowing Japanese might make it easier, but the puzzles do not require it or you can use shape recognition to figure them out. In this game, the last puzzle is impossible if you can‚Äôt read the Japanese text (or, as another reviewer stated, know the convention this game designer uses)."
"14676",1161175470,"Need to have English instructions."
"14677",1161194581,"I don‚Äôt like it because it goes to fast for you to move the block"
"14678",1161194581,"b r u h Tell me why?"
"14679",1161194581,"It is the way that I want it to go it won‚Äôt let me go the way that it wasn‚Äôt that I wanted to gopooop"
"14680",1161231636,"Fairly simple. I enjoy most of these games. What I didn‚Äôt get was the note with 4 circles. Don‚Äôt think I ever used it and was able to escape without it. Overall though Sato‚Äôs games keep me entertained."
"14681",1161231636,"I know some people have complained that the puzzles in ‚ÄúSigns‚Äù are too simplistic, and even redundant. I‚Äôm of the opinion that Sato‚Äôs puzzles are nicely integrated into the theme of each escape game, flow logically from step to step, and provide varying degrees of difficulty.  But beyond that, I play Sato‚Äôs Games - both the easier and more difficult - because of their beautiful, crisp graphics and zen-like groove.  ‚ÄúIllumination‚Äù was my only let down in that regard, and otherwise - just joy."
"14682",1161231636,"Delightful!"
"14683",1161267000,"That's it, that's all there is? More levels please! Great Game!"
"14684",1161267000,"It's a really really great game that a challenge of your brain, I love this game so much!"
"14685",1161267000,"The only complaint I have is that it drained my battery and made my phone uncomfortably warm.  So no long sessions playing this game.  Otherwise, it was a great puzzle game.  One of my favorites!   More levels, please!"
"14686",1161323425,"This game forces you to watch advertisements just to learn new concepts and you have to finish the level the EXACT way they want you to, otherwise it will not let you proceed."
"14687",1161323425,"If the tutorial was better at explaining the movement of the blocks this would have been more entertaining. There's a difference between a worthwhile puzzle game and cumbersome game."
"14688",1161323425,"Apparently they decided that what the world needed was a less fun version of something we already have.  ""crappy-ripoff-Tetris"" or whatever they called it. I don't remember the name cause I already deleted it."
"14689",1161444237,"This is a great add on to the elf experience. The game is fun for kids and adults and comes with additional activities making it well worth the 99cent price tag!"
"14690",1161444237,"Our family loves playing this game and appreciate the family values it teaches. Definite recommendation for the Christmas season."
"14691",1161444237,"I'm really disappointed that I have to pay for the app after I payed good money for the book & dog. My kids had to have this app once they saw it on the box.  I was going to buy reindeer for other my other child- but now they can Share the dog. Since I would than have to pay for the reindeer app too!  Disappointed Momma here."
"14692",1161496947,"BAD"
"14693",1161496947,"Ummmmmmmmm, relook at the title!!!! LOL"
"14694",1161496947,"Awful game"
"14695",1161538212,"Love this!  Sherm for President!"
"14696",1161538212,"Who doesn't want to text with Sherman's emoji?! This latest release is so cool with holiday and holiday emojis.   The designs are cool and the user interfaces are awesome. Lastly, the keyboard works very very well."
"14697",1161538212,"Downloaded the app, but unsure about allowing full access when it says it could see everything I have ever typed (including cr dit card number). Eek!!"
"14698",1161626399,"Right after I run from a wild Micromon it crashes"
"14699",1161626399,"as soon as i start the app it just closes the app it doesn‚Äôt let me start the game‚ùóÔ∏èim playing on a iphone 8 i dont know if it has anything to do with that"
"14700",1161626399,"So I love this game and the developers and I recently decided I wanted to try out the arena to get some diamonds to get a pet without paying money. Only I try and log on to the area and it never loads no matter if I‚Äôm on WiFi or not it will not load to let me play in the arena. I really want to give this game a better rating but with the arena being hyped up so much and not being able to play it I can‚Äôt. Hopefully the developers fix this issue."
"14701",1161656633,"I can‚Äôt get past lvl I keep ding so I deleted the game"
"14702",1161656633,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"14703",1161656633,"It‚Äôs really fun"
"14704",1161717622,"its a good game overall but i think that you should be able to pick:freehand writing or dotted lines.but it really is a good game."
"14705",1161717622,"I like Big Numbers but it needs an update. I have some ideas for an update. Maybe you could be able to send your friends materials. or use materials to speed up when you get a new tree .or when you‚Äôre making something. And maybe they could be a few more Islands."
"14706",1161717622,"Please put the game back to normal because it will ask you to  get 57295 coins for the orb I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs the right  Number SO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!"
"14707",1161739347,"Love it ! Fun to play."
"14708",1161739347,"I'm new at this game. I'll have to see."
"14709",1161739347,"Great fun"
"14710",1161746000,"Does not do anything it says, cannot make the extra helps work, bad game all around! Needs to be fixed or removed altogether!"
"14711",1161746000,"I really had fun with this game at first. Now I have been stuck on Level 75 for days! Very frustrating."
"14712",1161746000,"Didn't like the controls to shoot the bug....would rather it be like other ""bubble"" shooting games. Beat one level and uninstalled. I'll try another one."
"14713",1161836152,"Fantastic game. Love it!!"
"14714",1161836152,"This game is fun and challenging!! 5 stars!"
"14715",1161836152,"WOWWIE WOWWIE"
"14716",1162087330,"I CANT EVEN GET FREAKING 3!!! I got so mad that I threw my phone across the room and completely cracked the screen. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT A CRACKED PHONE SCREEN!!!!!"
"14717",1162087330,"I'm addicted and can't stop playing but I'm absolutely outraged at THIS GAME!!!! I like it you should get it."
"14718",1162087330,"Too many ads for this app, banner ads pop up ads everything."
"14719",1162255664,"They made like a total of 5 updates and ditched the game, it‚Äôs sad it was a great game."
"14720",1162255664,"I ‚ù§Ô∏è this game, BUT DA BLOOD DOE! Make the blood a little bit less graphic. I‚Äôm deleting if you don‚Äôt turn down the blood. (Just kidding)"
"14721",1162255664,"This game hasn‚Äôt been updated in 2 years, what‚Äôs up with that. I love this game and play it almost everyday but I need new content"
"14722",1162783385,"The detail in the writing of this choice game is absolutely enthralling. I replayed this story multiple times and depending on how i stated my genius and my instrument I had melodies running around in my Own head! Try it and you will be wrapped in this story. Totally unique and unlike any other choice story I've read ever! Nicely done. üòÅ"
"14723",1162783385,"The choices don't seem to matter save perhaps at the end. The romance with the Countess was unsatisfying, and most of the characters were forgettable, indeed when they popped up later they were I unremembered.  Effort went into the story, the premise had promise, but it was kind of mediocre in execution. The writer has potential, keep writing, just involve the reader more in what is going on."
"14724",1162783385,"Absolutely adored the story and characters. The game is also great for its replayability."
"14725",1162794046,"The game does not actually give you any real choices and you do not feel the eight of any choices you make. Ultimately you are forced to work alongside the revolution no matter what. The options for romance is so benign that there really isn‚Äôt any. No matter what choice you make the story goes on regardless and you with it.   It gives lots of names with no effort to actual have dialog with them. So your left with a strange informality with dozens of characters with as much character depth as a kiddy pool. Ultimately really disappointed and not worth the 6 bucks."
"14726",1162794046,"It's tragic that a game with such a good story and unique setting is ruined by awful stat designed.   Seriously, for most of the choices in the game you have to guess which stat correlates with it, and the stats themselves are just confusing sometimes. Some choices I can't even tell which one is reaction or vigor, or which one correlates with finesse and not vigor. It honestly ruins the game when I make every single decision incorrectly because I don't even understand what stats are being used.  Besides this, this game is great."
"14727",1162794046,"I really like the story and found it easy to get attached to the characters, very well written. Some of the mechanics didn't really make sense and sometimes it was hard to properly envision the setting, but all-in-all it was a great game."
"14728",1162838832,"Could not stop playing this game. So in depth and addicting, I highly recommend it"
"14729",1162838832,"I appreciate the intricacies and length of the game. The fact that one has to really think about their choices isn't found in a lot of COG apps. Not sure if I like the mechanic where the stats of the advisors affect which suggestion they'll give you; kinda messes with the way I view their character. Also a bit disappointed in the romantic gameplay; I wish there was more to it."
"14730",1162838832,"Worth the money! It's a bit pricey, but this is my favorite Choice Of game. There are so many storylines to explore, and the ending will definitely get you wanting to play again!"
"14731",1163313156,"I loved this game and all the others by this author and would absolutely love a third one. I definitely recommend this and the first one if you like sci-fi games"
"14732",1163313156,"First off, the biggest pro that I see in this game is how the story evolves. The first book focuses more on consistency, with developing the main goals of your character and making consistent choices paramount to succeed. However, the second book, while still making sure you keep consistency, offers you some more flexibility given the politicking scheming side of it. Overall, despite it being a little confusing at times, I find it best to take it at face value. If I don‚Äôt understand what is being explained, I either read it over or simply look at the choices and see which stat the choices utilizes best. This way, I can take it at ‚Äúface value‚Äù and just determine which choice coincides with my stat if the explaining gets too confusing. That said, I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone. Very well done."
"14733",1163313156,"A fantastic follow up from the Versus story. I cannot wait for the next addition!"
"14734",1163404732,"Do not download this app! It‚Äôs a SCAM to track your info. YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN WARNED!!! You want to use legit Jordan emoji‚Äôs and messaging? Download the footlocker app it has a Jordan emoji feature . You‚Äôre welcome."
"14735",1163404732,"Needs full access to phone that tracks and saves all you doü§î"
"14736",1163404732,"I use my phone to shop online so therefore ive used my cards multipul times on here.  I do not feel the need to share that information with any developer for any reason. So as much as i would love to use this jordan app, issa no from me."
"14737",1163470174,"The game was fun in general  .. had a great 3 hours trying to finish it :P  Would love to see more but would be better if they're a little bit longer"
"14738",1163470174,"Totally challenging but delightfully fun!!!"
"14739",1163470174,"Very nice game, beautiful graphics. Clever puzzles, though some were hard to figure out. A nice game for passing the time."
"14740",1163621234,"This is so confusing help me pls"
"14741",1163621234,"Awesome game 10 out of 10 great for time consuming ps Love to skins their so awesome Pls add more item and more skins I have collected all others items and skin plz make more"
"14742",1163621234,"The 360 flips and 720 flips should count for extra. You don't even have to ""flip"" anything for points. You get a flip each time you contact pan"
"14743",1163684161,"Each level is challenging. The flip mechanic is very well done and atmosphere is top notch."
"14744",1163684161,NA
"14745",1163684161,NA
"14746",1163777816,"Simple fun game to try to beat my pace each time."
"14747",1163777816,"I love playing"
"14748",1163777816,"Nice and interesting game"
"14749",1163925890,"This is like the most funniest game app ever fun for the whole family and friends"
"14750",1163925890,"Mad that only a few are free! but fun to play with groups"
"14751",1163925890,"Very fun to play"
"14752",1163993025,"Another good one from this Dev.  Clever, two endings, has a save.  No language issues even though clues are in Japanese on the English version..!!  Minus a star for that, and for full screen pop-up video ads.  The banner ad is sufficient, thanks!"
"14753",1163993025,NA
"14754",1163993025,NA
"14755",1164013670,"I really like this game. It‚Äôs addictive!"
"14756",1164013670,"Since I installed this game I haven't played any of my other games. Thank you for this game."
"14757",1164013670,"The game is a lot of fun but it has some glitches. Twice the game froze and one time I had to delete the game re-download and start from the beginning. Other than that it is a fun game."
"14758",1164046790,"Favorite game I own I wish there was more epics. Epic battle simulator 2 is horrible though every thing looks weird and its so so hard to play on the only thing it did right was adding more epics"
"14759",1164046790,"I get that running ads is how you make money but it takes away from from game when instead of seeing the victory screen after working hard to beat a level you get an ad. And it‚Äôs the same ad you seen over and over again. Game deleted."
"14760",1164046790,"Add tanks.Add laser gunners.Add people riding dragons.Add Ocean monsters to the epic‚Äôs."
"14761",1164147984,"Intriguing game with heartbreakingly poetic story."
"14762",1164147984,"I had absolutely no problem with freezing. My complaint....hence only 4 stars.....is that this fantastic game is WAY too short.  I don't have a lot of time for game-playing so I was extremely surprised when the storyline ended abruptly after playing about 4 hours total.  Seems like the creators were in a hurry to get it running without realizing how quickly it would be completed by even an average player like me.  I do hope the makers will consider making another great one like this but will make sure it takes a while to finish it."
"14763",1164147984,"This game looks like a lot of fun, and I'm sure it would be, but unfortunately it's designed to freeze part of the way through the first story.  I've restarted it, deleted and reinstalled it, but it's just too buggy and poorly made to function.  I think they should consider making this app free, so people aren't ripped off when it doesn't work."
"14764",1164376202,"This app is good not the best and even when u pay for the upgrade they still ask u to rate it all the time. Fix this problem."
"14765",1164376202,"Cute emojis but not worth the fee."
"14766",1164376202,"Payed for upgrade adds went away but no new emojis then offer another 17 and cant get to them love some of emoji my lover and I have fun would like what upgrade said no adds and lots more emojis buck up"
"14767",1164423068,"It‚Äôs stylish and smart. I was excited about it being optimized for iPhone X, but disappointed when I saw that the notch covered parts of the photo frame. I know we‚Äôre supposed to ‚Äúembrace the notch‚Äù and this is just personal preference, but I‚Äôd prefer data like images and photos to not be partially invisible with the notch. Otherwise, I believe this is a well executed app."
"14768",1164423068,"Needs a setting to TURN OFF automatic saving to Camera Roll and just make it a standalone app with pictures saved to itself."
"14769",1164423068,"Filters are great... If you can figure out how to export them! The user interface is a mess and its hard to find your way around this app. I bought all three from this developer in one go based on a recommendation from a website and frankly I wish I hadn't. Really bad user experience and its unclear how to get around the app. I've literally tapped and swiped my way around this thing to no avail. Messy and really needs to be better thought out. If you want to take photos quickly with nice filters and be on with your day, this is NOT the app to do it."
"14770",1164424437,"Clean sound effects and awesome game response to tapping things!  Love it üòç"
"14771",1164424437,"Every time a ad pops up it kicks me out of the game"
"14772",1164424437,"Âï¶Âï¶Âï¶"
"14773",1164439637,"WHAT THE POOPER SCOOPER THIS IS AWESOME"
"14774",1164439637,"Terrible game it is just terrible I highly do not suggest it is a waste of your time !"
"14775",1164439637,"Its a very good game even tho its pay to play"
"14776",1164468822,"Anything have a heartbeat I put my phone on my hand it picked up a heartbeat also my floor have a heartbeat ü§£ü§£ü§£ not worth the time removing app asap"
"14777",1164468822,"I‚Äôve tried this app twice, falling through with all the directions carefully and I still had no luck hearing my baby..."
"14778",1164468822,"This app is such a scam üòÇüòÇ it literally played a heartbeat before I even touched it to my stomach."
"14779",1164484325,"I just bought it for freaking $2 and all it gives you is pictures that you can look up online DONT GET THIS APP"
"14780",1164484325,"Dont trust instagram or what instagram said this app is a waste of money and is just a money grabber it only makes you a background"
"14781",1164484325,"A piece of crap"
"14782",1164492728,"If you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs easy to get into, with building complexity that keeps you engaged, this game will work. You get to use your spatial thinking and needing to turn the cube makes each puzzle more complex than you might think. I just finished the game and I enjoyed the time, I spent puzzling it out."
"14783",1164492728,"Fun game in the spirit of Rubik‚Äôs Cube"
"14784",1164492728,"This game is super fun so easy to pick it up but so hard to put it down i recommend this game to people who love a brain teaser and start to do something of good food fun this is why i rated this game 5/5 and it truly deserves this also taking the aesthetics into consideration, the graphics are just amazing and i truly love to play this game."
"14785",1164512642,"I love the squirrel! He is funny and cute! One time I made him fly over the road and I was laughing so much when I did that!"
"14786",1164512642,"You get to do the ice Ford and have a Lot of fun and decorate for the holidays!"
"14787",1164512642,"Love these apps! Keep up the good work."
"14788",1164801111,"Fantastic App. I have heart problems that pulse keeps on going up and down. Either very low pulse or a extremely high pulse w/A-fib. Gives a accurate description of what my heart was doing. Just it could tell me why. Let‚Äôs me know if I‚Äôm sleeping right. Too little or hoping that it‚Äôs enough. It‚Äôll even tell you if you‚Äôre achieving a good deep sleep and if it was long enough. I highly recommend this App. Also if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right, you can adjust to your sleep style"
"14789",1164801111,"I keep getting ‚Äúsystem error‚Äù and inaccurate results and ‚Äúno data from watch‚Äù when I‚Äôve been wearing it all night, keep it charged and follow the instructions. Buggy as heck. I tried to use lights off feature and it ended up just not recording the entire night at all.   Another review compared this app to the Fitbit sleep tracking and I agree. It‚Äôs pretty silly that the Apple Watch can‚Äôt be just as capable, considering how much they cost compare to Fitbit."
"14790",1164801111,"Really useful app. Just need to remember to keep my Apple Watch charged and to wear it at night. This app isn‚Äôt perfect, and I use it along side of Pillow, set to manually track my sleep, but I often forget to push the button with it being late and me being sleepy- enter AutoSleep! This app has really helped to fill in the gaps in my sleep tracking. The visuals are powerfully informative, and there are more features than I even know of. The documentation and the help is informative and does not leave me frustrated and scratching my head. If you feel overwhelmed with a feature, worry not, the most important features are intuitive, but the advanced features get pretty technical and intense.  I highly recommend this app, and many of my friends that I‚Äôve sung the praises to already were using it on a daily (nightly?) basis."
"14791",1165109912,"Thank you developers for providing a stress free game. The story was entertaining. The progress/grind was balanced well. And the app performed as well as my money spent upon purchasing the title. In other words thank you for keeping your word unlike other developers who expect payment but produce junk that doesn‚Äôt work. I look forward to purchasing other material from your studio."

"14800",1165482016,"I have such a feeling of release when I use this app. It's so important to talk to God and the Angels and this app facilitates this for me."
"14801",1165482016,"I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase to buy ""Let Go Let God!"" I think this app is wonderful!! For instance, I can talk into my phone about whoever, whenever, and never have a worry of doubt that it may get back to that someone or ever thinking about somebody else's feelings, or spoil a secret about so n so!! I like this app because at any given moment of the day, I can stop, pull out my phone and REALLY talk to God. I know, I talk to God throughout the day, everyday! This app has helped me to heal, let go, forgive but, most of all....grow! It's another tool for my tool box!  I live you Doreen V. Shannon C. Waterford, MI"
"14802",1165482016,"Idk what I thought I was going to get with this app but just having a recorder to talk into is NOT what I wanted...maybe some type of prayer or affirmation or quote after would be nice...I deleted the app since; waste of money in my opinion..."

"14805",1165525994,"I had hundreds of old photos to scan in multiple albums. This app made it so easy, I didn‚Äôt even  have to take the photos out of the albums. The process was incredibly quick. Now I have hundreds of photos safely stored and easily shared with my family."

"14813",1166398861,"All four are similar enjoyable texting based dating sims. It‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs strictly heterosexual relationships, but if that‚Äôs your thing, this ‚Äúcheating simulator‚Äù is a fun little take on dating games. If the others were to be released in actual English, I would play those as well."

"14816",1166596707,"It‚Äôs fun to play in the car when I don‚Äôt have anything to do"
"14817",1166596707,"I love this game but it‚Äôs always the same thing over and over so people it needs some new stuff. And I don‚Äôt have the full version so there is not that much stuff"
"14818",1166863768,"Fun game but lags horribly on the later tournaments making it almost unplayable and definitely unwinnable."
"14819",1166863768,"The control is terrible, there‚Äôs nothing between ‚Äúall-out kick it as hard as you can‚Äù and ‚Äúgive it a tiny tap‚Äù.  And the ability to grow your stats is very limited, so you can‚Äôt even invest time getting better before the campaign ends and you have to start over."
"14820",1166863768,"Too repetitive and no clear instructions or guide as what things do, despite claiming otherwise on all accounts"
"14821",1166974799,"I Believed in Santa and the Easter bunny and tooth fairy until now what are you gonna do when a kid like me goes through the App Store and sees this I burst into tears when I saw this you just crushed my childhood dreams"
"14822",1166974799,"I‚Äôve never left a review before but this app is brilliant! Made awesome pictures!"
"14823",1166974799,"Even after downloading the most recent version, this would not load on Easter. This is extremely disappointing as my kids have grown accustomed to ‚Äúcatching‚Äù the Easter Bunny in action."
"14824",1168399577,"Don't purchase this app it's not free and you have to put your phone number!!!!"
"14825",1168399577,"Love the design also the content of the app. It makes it much easier to follow the program, knowing how to execute every move to make the most of our fitness session and also not hurt ourselves.

"14827",1168567265,"Without having to hop on an extra controller, this is probably the most finished VR game out there. I finished the game quite quickly though, hope the devs continue to expand the story further and break the suspense."
"14828",1168567265,"This one of the most fun games I‚Äôve played on my Google Cardboard. For a horror game, it is surprisingly easy on the eyes. But I do miss more scares than in other games out there, and with having to constantly move and turn around, some aggressive zombies would make things interesting."
"14829",1168567265,"The gameplay is really good for a VR game, and I liked going till the end, finally managing to end that last wave of zombie ambush. Still, the game could be much better in terms of more gameplay. The current ending leaves much to the imagination and a few mission sets outside the hospital ought to do it."
"14830",1168645184,"My daughter loves this app... it‚Äôs the first thing on her mind when she wakes up. She loves dogs but we can‚Äôt have one at home and this does the trick, at least until we manage to make some space for a real one. We paid a $3 dollar one time fee and honestly is nothing when you see your kid so entertained with a smile on her face at all times."
"14831",1168645184,"I didn‚Äôt purchase this app.  Will delete the app."
"14832",1168645184,"Cute and my daughter loves all sago mini apps and paid for a few, but i did noticed they dont talk. Would be better if the characters talk. Will help kids with communication"
"14833",1169530248,"Too many ads. Goodbye"
"14834",1169530248,"One -- it's the fewest stars i can give in a review. This could be a mildly fun game,  but instead it's commercial trash.  Hadnt fully discovered the rules of game play by my second when it downloaded and launched a full screen 30 second video ad.  No warning, no cancel button. I'm taken aback.  What kind of scum comes up with this sort of ploy? This challenge the entire Apple Store and the dependent products.  Leave this one in the play store trashcan...."
"14835",1169530248,"SO many :30 ads right out of the gate - and after EVERY mini game - made it impossible to immerse, let alone get a feel for gameplay. This FTP model only works for some things, and rarely at that. Just charge a small price from the beginning. I would've likely given this very nice idea at least a chance."
"14836",1169545955,"Add boys"
"14837",1169545955,"I‚Äôve had this game since 8th grade till now and I love it but you guys need to update it more often there‚Äôs a lot of bugs, one of them is the game taking me to my home screen or the game just crashing. You should add maps and more characters if you can ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

"14875",1171814682,"There are too many ads and whenever I say I don‚Äôt want to watch an ad for extra life, it gives me an ad anyway and it‚Äôs really frustrating. I think that you should have a skin customize station in the game so you can mix some of the skins and create new ones! I also don‚Äôt like when you are trying to do a challenge and an ad pops up on the side of the screen, when you are turning and you accidentally click on the ad, it pauses the game and then when you click out of it you die. I think it‚Äôs a good game but too many ads that‚Äôs why only 3 stars:("

Every phone number in the game is four digits instead of seven or ten. It‚Äôs just the beginning of a series of immersion breaking choices. I can suspend disbelief for a bit, but eventually the lack of real world anything just doesn‚Äôt work for me."

"14919",1175953961,"I‚Äôve noted the same as previous reviewer‚Äòs. Many times things that you jump or collect are not added to your total while other times it is. It seems random and hard to reproduce. Most recently it was jumping over party tables and collecting confetti piles. For example, the goal will be 15 of one of those items and I kept manual account only to find I have very few or even zero at the end of the run when I was supposed to have cleared the task. Very frustrating for a paid game. If they fix the bugs, I‚Äôd recommend it. If not, look elsewhere."

I‚Äôve tried downloading them again and I‚Äôm using the same Apple ID that I bought them with. It‚Äôs really frustrating."
"14936",1176492470,"I just started playing, and I got tons of ads in just the first 10 minutes I played. I also don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt start at the beginning of how they met, and instead started at the wedding. And my last question was why I couldn‚Äôt choose who she married. ‚òπÔ∏è I guess it‚Äôs a good game if there wasn‚Äôt so many ads and everything was unlocked without buying or watching videos to get more options."
"14937",1176492470,"Why why why are there so many adds?!? Every time you go out of something, there‚Äôs the same adds over and over again. I can‚Äôt buy the adds free thing, so please narrow it down! And respond...please."
"14938",1176875793,"Yyttyyyf"
"14939",1176875793,"Will be deleting as soon as I hit the pay for play wall."
"14940",1176875793,"No reason for so many interruptions with the ads!"
"14941",1176877177,"Ok game till the ads take over!"
"14942",1176877177,"I'm having fun with the game"
"14943",1176877177,"Good game!"
"14944",1177414604,"Merry Happy Christmas indeed!  The arcade minigames on this one had me a bit kerflummoxed, but otherwise a nice little time-passer, with the wit and charm of all Jammsworks escapes. A holiday treat."
"14945",1177414604,"Although you can tell the English translation isn‚Äôt the best, the game is very fun. It‚Äôs not too complicated but makes you think and pay attention. The bonus gingerbread man game at the end put a smile on my face."
"14946",1177414604,"Fun, festive game that is great to relax and play. Some of the riddles did have me stumped for a bit! I really enjoyed it."
"14947",1177806007,"I purchased this app mainly for the health alerts. Myself and my daughters seem to be very sensitive to space weather, especially being pounded by cosmic radiation yesterday, and no alert was given. Lately I haven‚Äôt been getting any health alerts at all, so I hope that will change in the future. All I am getting lately is blot echo and earthquake alerts."
"14948",1177806007,"The old app was great! The New App also includes the combined Spaceweathernews.com feed which we use to monitor for extreme electrical plasma events in our local terrestrial, solar Neibor hood and beyond. We use the app to predict plasma events that affect our patients and our equipment for better patient care. Solar and terrestrial plasma events affect biology and equipment. This app keeps us on top of these events as close to live as it gets. Thank you Ben and crew Al Nunez DVM, CVA, CSO"
"14949",1177806007,"but when I try I get a message that says I‚Äôm already subscribed, so I can‚Äôt ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è have loved this app...would love to love it more with all the added stuff available with pro. Rating low due to my frustration here. Would love to change that rating if I can get a solution."
"14950",1178082935,"Good"
"14951",1178082935,"This is such a fun fun game."
"14952",1178082935,"I is always a little hard to tell were exactly your going to land so maybe there could be some kid of update"
"14953",1178454060,"The game itself is fine but for the camera person/ filmed there is only one girl and multiple boys"
"14954",1178454060,"Not bad, difficult but it's still fun and addictive to play!"
"14955",1178454060,"I didn't like the way the character is to be navigated. It like the makers did it that way to increase the amount of adds they can make money off of. I uninstalled the game. Too difficult."
"14956",1178454068,"This game is fun for a while but like all games, gets boring to play. I like the game and I believe that anyone would like the game, I recommend this app üòä"
"14957",1178454068,"This game is great! It‚Äôs basically just a random game to play when your bored, or need to pass time! I love getting new bottles to flip and I‚Äôve had this app for a VERY long time. Not on the same device but a few years actually. It‚Äôs extremely simple, not always EASY. But it‚Äôs simple! You have to hold down on the screen until it seems like it has enough power to jump/flip to the next object, and if you do it too hard it will fly to far or off the screen üòÇ there‚Äôs a blue Diamond thing that you can collect on most of them. The more you get of those, the more you get to buy a new bottle! The gameplay is really fun! I don‚Äôt see anything particularly WRONG with it, but it seems like it just needs a bit more.. I can‚Äôt really think of anything right now, but it just feels kinda plain. That‚Äôs why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Thank you! I recommend this app to people who just like to chill and play something simple to pass time! Byeee! Sincerely, Happy User üòÉ"
"14958",1178454068,"I love it so much.thank for who ever put bottle flip.by Chloe Thx"
"14959",1178472225,"Don't allow access to contact. Otherwise the app will send out a text to every contact inviting them to the app. Total scam and should be taken off the App Store."
"14960",1178472225,"Grabs your contacts and forwards message to them saying you've ""invited them"" even if you didn't. Don't download. Shady methods."
"14961",1178472225,"This app sent a message to all of my contacts without my consent. I clicked cancel on sending app invites but it still sent. Really shattered my confidence with the whole ""anonymous"" function this is supposed to have."
"14962",1178822943,"Don‚Äôt waste your dollar. For your money you get the privilege of spending more money. This app is useless."
"14963",1178822943,"Should have read reviews first. Lame and waste of money!!!!!!!!!"
"14964",1178822943,"The app itself just gives you the ability to buy the emojis. Waste of money!"
"14965",1178880179,"This is the best puzzle game I‚Äôve ever played. I remember seeing coryxkenshin playing this. The 1st Ao Oni"
"14966",1178880179,"Yes yes yes , this game is finally in the App Store üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª, I thought I will never see this game on phone specially iOS , I will never be disappointed of you guys (Apple) ( (App Store)üòâüòâüòâüòâüòâ!!!! üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªyeeeessss!!!"
"14967",1178880179,"I have known about Ao Oni for a while and this game made me confused because first of all the story doesn‚Äôt make since like where does it tie into the story, they could have gave us more new characters to show what happened to Hiroshi after he escaped Ao Oni but no it‚Äôs just the same cast same monster and just new map also the controls are just bad like they could have a little controller in the corner and even that would fix it. And also Ao Oni 3 needs to be translated to English and this game needs to be on more devices so it can get more popular and more plays"
"14968",1178973979,"There is NO sound. If it‚Äôs not fixed fast I‚Äôm disputing the charge!"
"14969",1178973979,"The controls aren‚Äôt intuitive at all. The screen is angle in a weird way and only responds to repeated tapping on the left or right side of the screen. Problem is is that your character moves at an angle."
"14970",1178973979,"My daughter is 4. She wanted a fun PJ masks game to play. What she got was a pseudo game with quite literally the worst control scheme I have ever seen. Pass it up. Not worth 3 bucks."
"14971",1179267591,"I love this game"
"14972",1179267591,"When I first drive I glitches and sometimes kicks me off the game"
"14973",1179267591,"You don‚Äôt get a chance to see what you did wrong just like someone said in the rate crashes. Some of the other cars that are driving around don‚Äôt help one because Sumer bump in to you with their side view mirrors. So I think they should go because in driving practice in real life there are no cars driving around you.   BAM                      WHAT !!!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"14974",1179462965,"First off the game is awesome .but Can you add cop cars and General Lee cars. When is the next update going to be . Send the answer to me. And when is the next update or next version of farming usa"
"14975",1179462965,"I think the game is grate but I wish that you could make it were you can purchase buildings and fences also. It would also be neat to be able to detach duals and loader arms. Also why does hired workers stop, and everything unhook when you go out of the game. It would also be neat if more than two people could be in a multiplayer game. Also why do hired workers sometimes stop the tractor and then drive backwards in circles. It would also be nice to make the hired workers would drive in circles instead of back and forth so the ends aren‚Äôt so sloppy. In the end you made a great game but I would like to see some of these improvements."
"14976",1179462965,"I have played this game since right after they came out with the tracked big tractor but I have watched it grow it went form being boring at first to after getting the online add on to being so much fun i have done so much farmed and logged and many other things"
"14977",1179475725,"What happened to Candy Cat..?   (P.S) Musical chairs isn‚Äôt a game anymore. It‚Äôs lord of the chairs."
"14978",1179475725,"I bought this because reviews were 3.6 and And one person said her daughter loved it and the sound problem could be fixed I can‚Äôt even figure out how to play the games and I cannot fix the sound problem. I think there should be a way to get a refund if you purchase something and I‚Äôm not going to use it"
"14979",1179475725,"The app seems to be defective. Absolutely no sound. Will give new review if issue is resolved"
"14980",1179685798,"App is no good and the reviews are clearly all fake.   Busted English saying the same generic yay good comments.   Boo.  Veer and your parent company should be booted for unethical practices."
"14981",1179685798,"I love the platform but the videos freeze a lot. Needs some work as to the titles dont show or the preview"
"14982",1179685798,"This is basically just a collection of random video excerpts. And I use the word excerpts because the videos are not complete. Some stop right in the middle. Many are advertisements for movies. It‚Äôs OK if you want a sampling of virtual reality videos, but I found it very unsatisfying"
"14983",1179840697,"I love saying to people ""hey, you have a dollar on you? I want to show you something cool!""  I always get a smile out of my audience.  Wish this app had more features, however I do love it's simplicity."
"14984",1179840697,"Every time I open the app and wait for it to open after I click start the app crashes- too bad it looks like it would of been pretty cool"
"14985",1179840697,"Awesome but you should be able to use Mexican dollar bills or pesos or even coins and yuan it would be sick"
"14986",1180340451,"Good enough to play sometimes"
"14987",1180340451,"Good"
"14988",1180340451,"That monster so scaring"
"14989",1180467988,"This is fun and challenging even if it‚Äôs not Christmas."
"14990",1180467988,"Meh"
"14991",1180467988,"Totally addicted. Put on music and I‚Äôm content to go brain dead"
"14992",1180885427,"As I said above, please update for iPhone X :)"
"14993",1180885427,"This is great for vr cardboard and iPhone. It doesn‚Äôt have hardly any ads and maze is hard to solve so it keeps you searching and shooting zombies. I did find a treasure chest but couldn‚Äôt open it. Very fun for a newbie vr experience. Can be played sitting down even on rotating desk chair. üòÇ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®"
"14994",1180885427,"Why are there birds cawing in the middle of a dark cave? Along with crickets? They don‚Äôt belong there, and what‚Äôs up with the same guy screaming every 40 seconds it drives me nuts. Well I‚Äôm sorry but put more work into this please"
"14995",1181616006,"I was digging this - great graphics, fun characters, but it needs some more playtesting. I can reliably fall through the floor in a few places on level 1-6. It makes my 6s really hot too -- I wouldn't mind an option to turn down the graphics quality to be able to play longer."
"14996",1181616006,"What a great game, very enjoyable. Has good tricky puzzles. Waiting for sequel.......Manoj"
"14997",1181616006,"The ""puzzles"" are lame! They don't make sense? They make the game a freakin chore to play. Why do I have to smash a crate against a wall to get a security card to open a door. Let me smash the door to get through it!   That Grav-I-gun thing is not easy to use and sometimes the camera angles makes it hard to see. It was a frustrating experience for me! 2 starts for effort..."
"14998",1181904201,"Absolutely, horrible I get penalties for not even doing anything"
"14999",1181904201,"Still learning the controls, but like it so far!"
"15000",1181904201,"It‚Äôs fun and all that but the car doesn‚Äôt have that mouch of control but it cool"

"15004",1182568288,"Christmas is my favorite holiday & I just got this app so I could share Santa with all of the kids in my family. My nieces are already hooked + the app is easy to use and it's inexpensive!"
"15005",1182568288,"The look that the kids in my fam make when they see Santa is priceless I love this app!"
"15006",1182568288,"This is cool"
"15007",1183234072,"Love the work and detail put into the emoji's and stickers! They are so fun to use:)"
"15008",1183234072,"I've love the ctfxc I'm happy that they have this app I support them 100% all the way I watched them from maybe day 20 they helped me throw the hard times in my life they make me smile and laugh"
"15009",1183234072,"Love using them! Basically my new form of communication!"
"15010",1183260922,"Fairly challenging, well thought-out escape room. The clues don‚Äôt have to be found in order."
"15011",1183260922,"This is an amazing game in my opinion, and I can‚Äôt believe they have a whole bunch more!!! I love it !!!"
"15012",1183260922,"Enjoyed playing!üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä"
"15013",1183548754,"Great"
"15014",1183548754,"Worth the time. Good puzzles."
"15015",1183548754,"Had to pay up front, ok. But then you had to pay extra for hints.  Had good reviews so, ok. But then the hints just directed you to a video that I could have found on YouTube. Deleted the game. Super lame."
"15016",1183986102,"Gbjbgcjnugrg"
"15017",1183986102,"I think in my opinion that you  shouldn‚Äôt have to watch ads every time you go to a new level and it said it was Santa hair Salon but really it‚Äôs all sorts of people it‚Äôs a great game for little girls and I guess if you want boys can also play it but don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a great game as well but there could be a few improvements here and there"
"15018",1183986102,"This game has no adds only some you don‚Äôt have to buy anythng it‚Äôs awesome"

"15021",1184800011,"Still can't finish the last puzzle with the 3 and colors. There is not a reference that I can find."
"15022",1185580782,"Okie so I've been playing this game for a while now and I was thinking what would be fun to add is dogs and cats you can tame and dolphins üôÇ"
"15023",1185580782,"Please add things like pet dogs and cats.More food types.more animals such as chickens and goats.And maybe add seasonal weather."
"15024",1185580782,"I love griffin! Will ya make a new griffin egg or depend on mods maybe! Will ya make a different a fancy saddle, crown, and king clothes, I always want to ride them!   I love Christmas decorations and clothes for reindeer! I will decorations my a new house if ya make them like simple carpet, candy, present, snowman, Santa, sleigh, bell, tea, Christmas wallpaper in the wall in the house I will be happy! I have 1 question! I don‚Äôt know how to say it but if can ya make reindeer in front of sleigh and probably keep reindeer can move everywhere on path I want it so badly   I love unicorn ( egg or mods) , I wish if ya make an ( wings) angel and devil wolf (egg or mods), dog, cat, hamster, panda, ride dolphin, creative dragon ( need an saddle), and everything for pets and ride too I am so excited if ya make a bowl for pets and rider too!

"15025",1186126548,"I read some of the negative reviews after I downloaded this game and immediately noticed that it was kind of blurry so I deleted the game from my iphone. But after couple of days I downloaded it again on my iphone, I realized it was not blurry at all, but rather part of the game‚Äôs creative design of xmas lights and fog and I have gotten used to it. I love this game. It is fun and easy. I finished it in less than 45 minutes. Goro Sato you‚Äôre the best. ü§ó Looking forward to your next game. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"15026",1186126548,"I enjoy all of Goro Sato‚Äôs games although they are all short and fairly easy. The one thing I did not like here was the blurry effect probably to give it a Christmas lighting feeling. That didn‚Äôt work for me."
"15027",1186126548,"I liked the theme and puzzles in the game. The hints section is also appreciated but the quality of the graphics is very poor."
"15028",1186384912,"It‚Äôs good, but whenever I play it, it lags off after one match that I played and I here myself playing but I don‚Äôt see anything else other than the garage when I joined in. Please fix that. Other than that, it‚Äôs a really good game!"
"15029",1186384912,"Great game! Love it!  Best VR game on IOS.  It keeps freezing though!  If it didn‚Äôt, I would give 5 stars.  Please fix"
"15030",1186384912,"Git a headset for me birthday and ive been using it ever sience"
"15031",1187279979,"OK, listen here. I made a pack for the spooky mansion. What a waste of time LOL. And then I try to create an animal and then I go to click the plus button and nothing works. This is stupid! So I clicked another one, doesn‚Äôt work. Another, doesn‚Äôt work. Another, doesn‚Äôt work. Please try to fix this before I never get this again. Bye."
"15032",1187279979,"Add all of the mobs please. I love if u could also allow us to make changes to the strength of mobs and make them hostile even if there a pig. And allow them to poison and give wither sickness. Last, I can even play the game so fix that. Thx for reading this"
"15033",1187279979,"I‚Äôve been using this developers‚Äô apps for years and am honestly disappointed with how awful the UI and tools work. It pains me to see what you‚Äôve made."
"15034",1187282363,"We need new questions"
"15035",1187282363,"I love this game but we need more Questions please!!! Or replay value is low. Otherwise worth the buy :)"
"15036",1187282363,"Drinking suggests why I was so frivolous to buy it."
"15037",1187617475,"There was a game in 2011 called Tetra3D that I used to play all the time. It was the same as Tetris, wherein you could move the block anywhere on the board by turning the board one turn (as you can with this game) but you could also move the placement of the block (in Kubik, if a block is going to land in the middle, no matter how you rotate it, it will land on the middle of whatever side it ends up on). Further in Tetra3D you could rotate the block along the x, y, and z axes.   The game stopped working a long time ago and hasn‚Äôt been updated in years, in fact I can no longer find it in the App Store. Kubik is the closest game I have found to my former favorite game, but as it is now missing the ability to move the blocks as freely as I expect has made the game frustrating and not fun.   If possible I would love more ability to rotate and flip blocks, and to move the location of the falling blocks rather than just being able to rotate the base that they are falling onto.   Thanks!"
"15038",1187617475,"After you get them all it‚Äôs kind of pointless and all the diamonds just rack up and i have nothing to do with them. All in all it‚Äôs a fun game, but would love some new planets"
"15039",1187617475,"Has nice visuals and color schemes, has a great game concept. I like the level of difficulty, as it is both do-able and challenging.   It is hard to navigate or choose the planets, though,it would be easier to be able to see them all and select one, instead of having to scroll through them all.   Also, creating an option to turn off/on the music and sound separately, that‚Äôd be nice. Missions/achievements, maybe? Some improvements can be made. But overall, nice game to play."
"15040",1187779532,"Loving the new app"
"15041",1187779532,"I would have given this 5 stars but where are the Pete Emojis?"
"15042",1187779532,"It's epically disappointing to see ""you're"" misspelled in the lyric section.   The art is super fun! Brettie is the best!"
