"1",281796108,"I was looking everywhere for the perfect app with which to take notes, keep records of things, or just to scribble down my thoughts or ideas, but I hadn’t had much luck before I found this app. Five minutes into using Evernote, I began to think this really might be it. I was so excited... until it started randomly crashing on me. I haven’t been counting, but I’m thinking it may have crashed about 30 times already in the last 10 hours. I’ll be sticking with it as long as I see improvements over time."
"2",281796108,"I love this but the on thing i don’t like if i want to have reminder for every single task on my to do list and can’t and more different fonts on writing and i also i would like a feature to be able to look each individual note as well"
"3",281796108,"I don’t know why I have a badge unless I search the whole app. A Notification Center would be useful."
"4",281940292,"Crashed at times but overall wonderful!"
"5",281940292,"This is a fantastic weather tool"
"6",281940292,"Great app. Reliable and dependable"
"7",282614216,"It’s cool"
"8",282614216,"Don't like Ebay too much waiting to deal with a dead beet seller, making the buyer wait for a long time to get results or money back"
"9",282614216,"Very good"
"10",282935706,"Very good and easy to use!"
"11",282935706,"I love reading the daily devotional plans"
"12",282935706,"Everyone should have this app on there phone. Daily usage makes everyday an amazing day!"
"13",283619399,"Love the game but, no new updates of any kind ie new tiles.  I guessing since this particular mahjong is not gouging our pockets therefore no new anything!"
"14",283619399,"Layout is too close to bottom screen, some pieces are hidden or difficult to see"
"15",283619399,"Have always loved this game because of the stunning graphics on tile and background choices. Have never seen a better mahjong game. Can upload photos to use as background and tile images can't be beat anywhere else. Had it for years and it's still the best!! Thank you 😁"
"16",283646709,"Ugh! I’ve never had so much difficulty getting my own money! Never again!!"
"17",283646709,"I have been with PayPal since 2007, I buy and sell on EBay, and also use PayPal for personal and business use outside of PayPal. I sold an item on EBay but the buyer was having issues logging into PayPal through EBay so they sent me the money through PayPal Goods & Services. It’s been 2 days and my money is still being held, item has already shipped and I added the tracking number to the PayPal transaction. When I call I am told it is the automatic security protocol and it is not anything that can be corrected by a person. I asked how long the hold is, I was told “Oh, we’re not told that, this way if a scammer calls trying to steal money, we can’t tell them when to try and transfer the money again. The hold is for as long as the security system wants it to be and that’s solely controlled by the computer system.” Seriously? A computer, who does not have a mortgage, a family, bills, or a life, is in sole control of when I can have my money. The sale was for over $1,000 and I even added money to the account at the recommendation of a PayPal associate to “trick the system, since you’re adding money from the account you’re trying to transfer to so you can’t possibly be stealing.” Now that money is stuck in “computer-controlled hold” also. Customer Service has been rude, unhelpful, and unknowledgeable. I can believe the lack of competency and that no one can do anything to get me my money. I mean they had me create a second account and try to transfer it there and then literally said “well, beats me!” when it did not work. Very frustrating, just lost a loyal long-time customer and her long-time customer parents, family, and friends."
"18",283646709,"Why $43.80 charge on a (US Domestic) transfer of $1500?  I WAS NOT NOTIFIED of this whatsoever and will not be using PayPal any longer if this is normal. Its exorbitant.   Doug White"
"19",284035177,"Maybe my Fav!! But, there aren’t many directions for ALL the things Pandora can do. So go ahead, and scour this app. I can’t tell you everything it does. As a matter of fact, every time I’m listening.   I start looking for new content. 10 *."
"20",284035177,"The best"
"21",284035177,"After trying to load pandora today I find out they no longer allow vpns. Looks like I’ll be switching to a different streaming service as I’m not planning on dropping my vpn."
"22",284666222,"I actually like the app for its memory feature among other things that the standard iPhone calculator app doesn’t give you, but I’ve come across this weird calculation where for example I’ll type in “80.32-20.25-60.07” when I equal it, it should say it equals 0, but instead I get “-7.1054273576^-15”. And yes I understand this is basically 0 but I don’t understand why I gives me this unnecessary number instead of just 0. I’ve tested this exact calculation on a number of other apps and even physical calculators as well as the standard iPhone app and they all give me 0. I thought maybe I accidentally changed a setting so I reset the app to its original settings but the same thing persists. Maybe there’s a fix for this and I’m just not getting it, but for now to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing in the settings that prevents this from happening."
"23",284666222,"A really well designed calculator - probably 2nd only to the HP Prime Pro app (although with some bugs, HP Prime is programmable, and has computer algebra system and graphing functionality).  Hence the suggestion to add graphing capabilities (e.g. with sliders as in Desmos) and CAS."
"24",284666222,"What more can I say?! 🤩"
"25",284736660,"It still looks a lot like the original video game, but the swipe controls are no longer functional.   FIX THE SWIPE CONTROLS!!!!!!"
"26",284736660,"This game is utterly useless since the upgrade went into effect. The brain dead imbeciles behind the alterations are apparently unaware of the concept of improvement, and have created an app that is vastly inferior to its previous iteration. The game was entertaining, now it is unplayable. Don't bother if you don't have it, delete if you do."
"27",284736660,"El control de juego en pantalla funciona con mucha dificultad  En cambio el juego de Ms. PAC-MAN lite yo lo descargue y el control de pantalla funciona muy bien  Necesito saber si me pueden corregir este problema o poder descargar otro juego igual que ese pero con el problema corregido Gracias  Atentamente Samuel Velazquez  7872093889"
"28",284791396,"Relaxing and very addicted. I love it  Keeps my brain active"
"29",284791396,"The selection bar at the bottom disappears too often!"
"30",284791396,"Love this app. Challenging, fun, great graphics. Definitely a top notch Solitaire game."
"31",284815117,"Once again, the app is not working. So annoying and frustrating. I bet the free one works, but it really annoys me that I have to resort to that version. Third time in a month, at least, where it has quit working.😡😡👎👎"
"32",284815117,"New version stinks.  Bring back the old one please!!!  I cannot turn off teacher even though u say I can. I hate it."
"33",284815117,"Not happy today. Had to download game because it wouldn’t load my game list. Now I have ads even though it is supposed to be the premium version."
"34",284815942,"The white is way too bright and I don’t really like having to use incognito all the time so if you could please just add dark mode compatibility that would be great!"
"35",284815942,"I’m really writing this review so Google could possibly see it and add a dark mode like iOS’s dark mode. And obviously the app is good, it’s Google."
"36",284815942,"What I mean by the title is that when you click on google you’ll of course see other news besides the one on of what’s under What’s treading when you search something there. Of course I love Monsta x and interested in other topics beside Kpop you know, but there aren’t any news about anything, and when you click on google it only says google and nothing else. Could anyone pls tell me why this happens? But overall I give it 5 star because it have topics I want to read or know more about something."
"37",284847138,"The process is easy the explanation is understood easy to move from one service to another’s"
"38",284847138,"Directions for editing or deleting an account are useless. You’re only given the chance for that when you are adding an account. How do you delete obsolete accounts?"
"39",284847138,"We have been with B of A for more than 35 years and we still get the same excellent service. We wouldn’t go any where else.  Thanks very much for your  commitment to excellence."
"40",284862767,"This game has a scoring system tilted towards those who have patience to practice a game until they can land an unbelievable high score.  The high score times are so fast I don’t think I could tap cards fast enough to match them.    I would prefer the game started timing as soon as the cards are dealt so no practice was possible and players can only go by skill.  Keep a running 24 hour high score and increase the number of rankings so everyone who plays a game can see where they stand  - not just top 10 but top 1000 or 10000.    That would keep my addiction going."
"41",284862767,"I love this game, because much of it is old-school FreeCell, with the ability of playing both random games and numbered games. However, I have no intention of playing it daily. I have daily goals for Spanish, not for solitaire.   Please give us a way to totally turn daily goals off. I’ll bump it back up to five stars if you do.  Update. The daily goals now has some use for me! However, is probably not the use you intend. Because it tells me that I have won my first game of the day, I now only play one game per day. Thank you! ;)"
"42",284862767,"Been playing it for years and it is the best of all the games available. Can’t do without it. Very well run so will have even the smallest problem and I love it. Ann"
"43",284876795,"As above"
"44",284876795,"Friendly and helpful staff.  Clean.  Beds comfortable.  Breakfast was adequate.  Some might be disappointed no Meat or hot eggs but there were boiled eggs.  Pancakes, waffles, cereal, toast, yogurt, and mini muffins.  You might want to be aware there is no elevator if have mobility issues.  My husband and I would stay there again."
"45",284876795,"I use this app every time I need to plan a trip! Thank you trip advisor!"
"46",284882215,"I recently was logged out of my account and when I tried to log back in they have a security measure of sending a code to the phone you made account with. I no longer own that phone or number so getting back into my account is impossible especially when the way to contact fb is not designed for every issue even though this is a common issue. There is no back door to correct the problem and emailing fb is useless and the help center is generic .."
"47",284882215,"Facebook me cierra cada vez que entro"
"48",284882215,"Great app but needs a new dark mode to go with messenger & iOS 13. Love the new features & speed"
"49",284910350,"We just finished a delightful and delicious meal at the Riverhouse and closed the place. 6 of us dined on 6 different entrees. Everyone more than satisfied. Unique fresh ingredients combined to create an amazing meal. Friendly server taking time to chat. We arrived later after visiting Munsen falls and were not rushed at all. Enjoy!! We did!!"
"50",284910350,"The reviews on businesses get removed because they believe that the reviews are fake or illegitimate. Yelp is not big in some towns so the people reviewing are probably real costumers writing honest reviews, but I guess they see them as fake profiles due to them not reviewing places much overtime or having friends added on yelp."
"51",284910350,"Excellent app"
"52",284993459,"Never opens Spotify when prompted. idk"

"56",285946052,"I really wish you guys didn’t do this. I would have paid an extra $100 for you to update iQuran HD so I can continue to use it. I have YEARS OF NOTES on that app. It is highly inconsiderate to your brothers and sisters who bought the app and used it for years not to update it. Now I have to migrate all my notes which will take weeks. Please have some understanding and update the app many of us already paid for. I know I will pay again. No problem."
"57",285946052,"I love this app, may Allah bless the developer of this app, and give him guidance to create the iPad version too. Aameen!"
"58",285994151,"Play of the game is excellent but the tutorials leave a lot to be desired."
"59",285994151,"This is a really fantastic sudoku app, and I use it pretty much daily. However, the developer no longer supports it.   One major issue that has cropped up is that it frequently serves puzzles that are one or two grades above what you choose. So choose “mild”, and you’re dealing with an “intricate” puzzle. It’s not consistent, though. And what’s worse is that there’s no indication this has happened until you find yourself stumped on what should be a puzzle that requires no advanced moves.   Beyond that, the “best” time displayed will change pretty constantly while you’re playing a puzzle, so you won’t know what your actual record is until you beat it. And just a complaint, the “lessons” for advanced moves, etc., are incomprehensible. You could have just sat on a keyboard and created clearer instructions than what’s there."
"60",285994151,"I think this is the best Sudoku app available for cell phones.   I play it all the time and I have still not used all of the options."
"61",286058814,"Really really good app. Shouldn’t overlook this one"
"62",286058814,"Verizon customers used to be able to stream data free. Now it's changed and found out the hard way. Gotta change to Sprint after this. Smh"
"63",286058814,"Need to be able to Chromecast or stream what’s on the app to tv’s."
"64",286070473,"Top app!"

"67",286799607,"the best tuner on planet earth. accurate, fast, and, most importantly, *steady*. that’s what keeps me coming back to it after all these years. i’d pay a $10 a year subscription if i had to for this but i think it was only a buck or two when i bought it in 2011 or something."
"68",286799607,"I specifically bought this app for the “unlock” feature that enabled the glissando pitch wheel that a friend showed me but the current version doesn’t have that feature. Huge drag and very disappointed."
"69",286799607,"The app no longer works. I have been using it for years and it did great. Very sad."
"70",286906691,"Jeff wittek sent me ig@akaserner"
"71",286906691,"The app is fine and cool. If you upgrade to premium you are wasting your money. I upgraded, it said 5.99 a month I think for six months. I got access to plans like keto things, which I wasn’t interested in the diet plans they have and more diagnostics for your fat,  calories, etc and it wasn’t worth it. Then I tried to cancel my subscription and it charged me the full amount that would have been charged in six months."
"72",286906691,"I like this app a lot - it’s helped keep me on track with my diet and also seamlessly works with my Apple health apps. Excellent!"
"73",288113403,"It’s a great app, the only problem is it is a little too specific sometimes and doesn’t get the rough translation. I put nice in and it said it meant Bonita. But other than that, great app."
"74",288113403,"Love this app, it works pretty well some translations are not very accurate but in general it’s a really good app👌👌"
"75",288113403,"One of the best apps I’ve ever used. Never let you down and always helped me out. Can’t say anything much better than that!! Bravo"
"76",288120394,"This application allows me to substitute a large lighting console for a coupe of iPads and has the flexibility for custom building or layouts.  Money well spent, this has been quality since first purchased 5 years ago."
"77",288120394,"The user can interface easily, change buttons and more.   Just download the programs from the website and use them along with this tool."
"78",288120394,"I would love it if this could be updated for iPhoneX, thank you!"
"79",288419283,"I had RadarScope for a while now and when I got a new phone I can’t remember what email address I used to log in with."
"80",288419283,"Wow, this update stinks.  Took away most of the features and lost resolution.  Are you making us pay $100 per year for what I had before?  Really?"
"81",288419283,"Great app, not for beginners as you need to have more than a basic knowledge of how to read and interpret radar on the map. Once you are able to understand you will discover how much this app has to offer. I have the base app without a subscription and that is good enough for me. Radar updates very quickly. Kansas City was nearly slammed with an EF4 tornado in May of this year (2019) and RadarScope displayed accurate velocity to pinpoint where the mile wide tornado was located. I was able to monitor the debris field as well using correlation coefficient. This app is strictly radar and is best used with other apps such as The Weather Channel for forecasts. This is my go to radar app. Fantastic. The only change I would make would be a more detailed map."
"82",288429040,"The app is a inflexible fire hose of ads, upsells, click-bait and lame “classes” which all slow down and interrupt your conversations. Yeah, I spoke to their mobile team, and they admitted it’s ad impressions and daily click interactions that matter most. You don’t use this app—it uses you. It makes me so sad. Premium adds more nags and spam.  Did someone in your network get tricked into uploading your private address so they can spam and sell it as a feature to advertisers? Were you that person?   Edit: your mobile team already looked closer and confessed"
"83",288429040,"The app is no longer functioning. Doesn’t refresh. Connections and messages pages won’t load either. iPhone 7Plus."
"84",288429040,"Hello-     Was impressed so far."
"85",289084315,"Best app I’ve used to track my cycle and related symptoms"
"86",289084315,"Please add masturbating in the had sex part. Yes it does sound funny."
"87",289084315,"Very useful and helpful!"
"88",289446241,"This is a great tool right now with the election tightening. Very fun and well written."
"89",289446241,"Complete waste of money and time."
"90",289446241,"Not accurate one sided"
"91",289523017,"This is by far the best blackjack game out there. It goes fast so you don’t have to sit there while the dealer slowly deals cards and wait for the next hand. You can get to it right away.  As far as rating this, I’d give it 5 stars BUT, the ads were incessantly obnoxious and completely annoying by constantly interrupting the game and then I’d forget where I was and lose my concentration. One of them even requires me to power off my phone to get rid of the music!! They said if you make a purchase, it will eliminate the adds.  So I made a purchase but the ads keep coming and coming. PLEASE STOP! Now I’m having to sit here on the phone with ITunes for hours waiting to get a refund. If you’re considering making a purchase through this app, DONT DO IT!  Not if you value your time that is."
"92",289523017,"Adequate but not great program.   Cons: — Very slow to load, and has to reload every time you do something on phone like check messages.  — no way to play with a set amount of money, like $500 and see how you do.  You can only play with your entire bank all at once.   — cards are *very* small and difficult to see.   — even after paying you gets tons of ads for other games.  Really irritating."
"93",289523017,"I like it very!!!! Much"
"94",289894882,"Last update took away family sharing. No I have to buy again. That is BS. App worked fine for years and still says it is compatible family sharing, but apparently not anymore."
"95",289894882,"There is so much provided in this app for such a ridiculously cheap price, you need to get this even if you only use it once. Which you won’t because it has such a wide variety of sounds, mixes, options, etc. the possibilities are truly limitless. One of the best bangs for your buck out there! I feel guilty not paying more."
"96",289894882,"I downloaded this app in a pinch for my toddler and baby to be able to sleep at a relative’s house and it works great! So many different sounds to choose from as well as asleep mode were you can see a large clock on your phone as if you have your plugged in alarm clock at home with you!  They really thought this one out! 5 stars for sure!! I’m 6 years into using it and still use the clock part every night! It’s a win win in my book!"
"97",290638154,"the instant you stop playing audio the app essentially closes itself. You have to go through the whole process of relaunching the app, finding what you were listening and searching for the point at which you stopped playing it. What a worthless junk app."
"98",290638154,"How many times am I going to hear the same farmers insurance add in a row!?!?"
"99",290638154,"Thank you so much for fixing the app for voice over users i love the iHeartRadio app some of my favorite stations are power 105.1 New York and 102.5 wiog and 104.5 the cat just to name a couple i use this app every day and i have used the iHeartRadio app sense i was 10 years old and now i am 16 years old so i hope this app is here to stay for ever and ever"
"100",290986013,"I always hear such great things about this app, and it’s better than nothing, but it’s missing the most obvious feature: connecting to my UPS/Fedex/USPS/Amazon accounts and adding deliveries automatically. You can do this via email forwarding but that’s a pain to set up."
"101",290986013,"For rwviews"
"102",290986013,"I’ve been using Deliveries for years. Junecloud has done a great job of building, maintaining, and improving this app across all platforms. I even use Junecloud Sync over iCloud because it’s so much faster and more consistent. Plus, who can resist arguably the best icon on the App Store?"

"106",292628469,"If you are looking for an app that can do some amazing things, this is it!  And once you get the hang of it, it is really easy and really quick to generate some great photoshop creations.  All you really need is your finger.  If you want to use Apple Pencil, you can really get down to the fine details, but you really do not need it to creat some great photos.  I’ve been using this for a year or more and it is my go-to app for making my friends laugh with some awesome photoshops. Play around with the features and you’ll begin to see how well done this app really is and how creative you can be."
"107",292628469,"Yes, it’s awesomely easy to put together fun photos but it’s more. My daughter died on the Mother’s Day weekend we were going to get photos professionally taken of our family together.  With this app I can put my angel into  that last photo and create her headstone- thank you. Jan from Tx"
"108",292628469,"This is by far the best editing app in the App Store. About as good as adobe photoshop. It’ll be great if they made a version for the MacBook/iMac. If they do this, I’d cancel my adobe subscription in a heartbeat. Other features would be great too to have with editing: skew, dispersion,  perspective, stretch, HDR transform selection. Thoughts?"

"110",292738169,"I’m happy that Deezer is a default music source for Chromecast Home, which is primarily how I use it at home.  But in the car, it is almost useless: #1 My library artist list is not alphabetical.  Making it nearly impossible to find the artist you are looking for. #2 Album list is arbitrary and truncated.  Only about 25% of the albums for any particular artist shows up in CarPlay.    #3 There is no search function.  Also, when playing music at home there is no straightforward way to play just the songs of one artist in random order.  Instead, when requesting to play the songs of one artist, the default is for it to play artists Deezer deems as “related”, in a Flow-like fashion."

"112",293118835,"That's the message I get after the most recent upgrade to iStellar. Tech Support at AstroArts gave the typical non-response:We're sorry that you got trouble.iStellar works any iPhone/iPod touch with iPhone OS 3.0 or later. So you try re-sync application using iTunes.I resync at least once a day, and I'm running the latest OS on an iPhone 3G."
"113",293118835,"I have been using Planetarium for Palm OS for years. It has 2 million stars, full object databases, Alt-Az and sky view, rise/set times and much more. It is a professional grade tool. It's $30. This app is a fun toy but not worth the price."
"114",293118835,"The ""Light Pollution"" setting is a brilliant feature for deciding what you could actually see in-town.  This is also one of the only apps I've seen that includes the Constellation Picture/Artwork so you can try to visualize what you actually see.  The app feels very light-weight and not prone to crashing from heavy use.I can go stargazing anytime and anyplace using this app! Search for a constellation, check the name of a star, or simply admire the sunset, twinkling stars, the Milky Way, etc. iStellar is no less functional than an actual star atlas/planetarium, and far more easy to control!"
"115",293523031,"I don’t like the new update— I liked having the Alarm accessible on the settings page without having to open up another window. Makes it difficult to change, which I do frequently.   Also smaller to read than before."
"116",293523031,"This app is honestly garbage. Even with the updates, I still have to close out of the app almost every time I use the app just to make it work. It crashes so easily. FIX THIS MESS!!"

I have had this app for about 5 years and have not seen any of my properties updated in that time span. My family has property in a very unpopulated part of Mississippi and we have majorly developed this property over the last 5-6 years, with nothing to show on this app. With technology evolving rapidly Google Earth is not, if you want to please the world don’t just focus on major cities @GOOGLE"

"125",293760823,"Works good however when you press feel lucky some of the noises have people talking or words I wish it would not do that I only want to hear fart sounds"

"129",293778748,"13 September, 2019 I LOWERED the rating from 5 stars to 2 STARS after the latest update. It’s awful. It doesn’t give you your rewards, it’s full of glitches. Whenever they address the issues I’ll update my review, but until then BEWARE OF DOWNLOADING THIS APP UNTIL THEY FIX THE ISSUES‼️‼️‼️‼️  5 May, 2018  The app support team responded making them aware that after the update the game wouldn’t load. As soon as it was fixed they sent me an Email letting me know that the issue was resolved, so I immediately reloaded on my device and I really love this blast from the past game, and encourage you to download it ASAP. 😊👍🏻❤️👍🏻⭐️❤️⭐️⭐️❤️"

"131",294056623,"Downloaded this app about a month ago, and it didn’t work then as a poor substitute for Fox Sports Go. Kept crashing on anything I tried to start streaming. Gave it another try tonight and it still doesn’t work. I could sign in with my cable provider, but the app kept asking me to sign in again. Never got past that. Checked the other reviews and see that most other people have similar problems. Fox’ only answer is to try the help desk with a long link that won’t work and won’t copy. Get rid of it and put the content back on Fox Sports Go, which works well."
"132",294056623,"Fox sports Go dumps me into this app for a game I should be able to watch. But the app can’t find the game. When I find the link to watch the game finally, it redirects me to the App Store to download the app I’m already using. So that needs to get fixed."

"135",294536447,"It's a great app for children who are learning about sounds and music, colors, and numbers. It's a fun way to introduce apps to young children without the bombardment of ad cycles and ad knowledge of what you shop for."
"136",294631159,"My only quibble is with having to sign in with every app, although this might be due to Apple application requirements…?"
"137",294631159,"At almost 9 dollars at year is by far the most expensive weather app in the store. However this elevated price doesn’t come along with quality neither precise predictions."
"138",294631159,"The interface is WAY too busy and complex and after purchasing I found that most of the advanced features require a subscription."
"139",294934058,"I will admit I was originally disappointed and turned off by HotSchedules because this platform is predominately used for scheduling within the service industry and therefore hourly wages employees.  The company is paying a licensing fee to use the platform and I, the hourly wage employee, still have to pay to download the app?!!   It feels icky. Of course you’re going to charge the lowest tiered group to use your services because they have to use your services when you should just price your platform costs appropriately.   My disappointment was compounded because getting logged into the app is a NIGHTMARE. Horrible experience. I reset my password yesterday and still can’t get into the app and am resorting to my desktop.  I’ve tried multiple times. If I’m paying to have this app, I’d expect it to be the best app on my phone and its just not.  Also, this is the only app on my phone I’ve paid to download.    Once you can get logged in, the app is convenient and handy.  Easy to navigate and the layout makes sense. Not tons of lag or anything either.   Please fix your login issues and let your finance/accounts team know you’re pricing structure isn’t a good look."
"140",294934058,"The app is too slow and keeps loosing connection. I checked if my version of the app was up to date, and it was and it still glitches. One of the worst changes my job did. I would put more stars if it was a smoother experience. And to think I rely on this because my job depends on it. The least it can do is not cut connection on high network."
"141",294934058,"Make availability easier because it takes too long going through all the days of a month to set it up"
"142",295430577,"Did this get removed?  It’s the most useful feature."
"143",295430577,"I used to be really impressed with this App., but now tends to lock up.   You get notifications of some celestial event and when you click on it you would think it would take you to the event, unfortunately not. I’m not sure if recent software updates, either the App or the OS, have made this formally amazing Program falter but hope the developers are able fix it.   Still a fan, but have lost some of my enthusiasm."
"144",295430577,"Crap now."
"145",295646461,"Why does it take so long to start?  You click on it and there is a 10 second delay before anything happens.  This is much slower than any other app I use."
"146",295646461,"Why is the Weather Channel supporting the liberal lefts Global warming Agenda? They gave Al Gore several time slots pushing his BS and now I just saw another guest speaker supporting this junk. How much money is the weather channel taking from these liberals to let them use air time?? If you don’t stop talking about Global warning I will push for a boycott of The Weather Channel by conservatives and Church people until you put a conservative agenda out there too!"

"148",295759189,"i love this app. it is perfect for me to look back on incredible memories. i got it back when i was a 14 year old in high school, and it is so much fun to look back at age 20 and see all the things i did. great app."
"149",295759189,"Been using this simple countdown app for years and very happy with new update!"
"150",295759189,"It works. It’s simple. It’s easily configured. Everything an excellent phone app should be!"
"151",295775656,"I have had this app for all of my 8 1/2 years of sobriety. I upgraded my iPhone to the iPhone X two weeks ago and now I’m told that I have to rebuy the app. It just doesn’t seem right. Why must I repurchase an app I’ve already paid for just because I got a new telephone?"
"152",295775656,"Absolute Crap"
"153",295775656,"*** Update *** Messaged developer Dean, and he walked me through how to do a no-cost “delete and re-download.”  Works fine, glitch was during the first download and not the app itself.   Dean responded quickly, professionally, and even did a follow-up to be sure I was happy.  Well done, and I AM happy with the app now!  I recently downloaded this app, and it seems to be everything I wanted. But sometimes when you select a sentence or passage to highlight, when you actually hit Highlight, sometimes it works, but sometimes it DELETES the selection!"

"155",296581815,"Hubby and I decided to try Bourbons for our fort-ninth anniversary dinner and we were definitely not disappointed. We started with the fried free tomatoes, yum! I had a Rosemary Bourbon Sour which was very tasty. Hubby had a filet which he said was excellent and very tender. I had the short ribs, Gouda grits, collard greens and cornbread. It was all wonderful. Hubby ended with the Hummingbird cake which he said was delicious and I ended with a Bailey’s and coffee. All in all a very nice experience. We will definitely be back!"

"157",297244048,"I love it! Only thing I wish I could do with it, is control my mouse."
"158",297244048,"What’s the Blazes happened to my review!?  (to “Sifu_Char”: You CAN use VLCr on more than one iPhone, as long as all devices are connected to the same local area network. You can even use VLC Remote on two iPhones and one Android if you have it installed on there as well. The set up for VLC Remote only needs to be run once, after that you can connect as many devices to VLC as you have devices that have VLC remote installed on, and they don’t all have to be iPhones, The android app detects VLC after it has been set up just like the iPhone version. Hope that helps.)  I am afraid this app has fallen into disuse over the last couple of years, mostly due to many people moving to an easier platform to maintain: namely PLEX and PLEX pass.  But back when iPhones were a new deal, people mostly used one app and one app only to maintain their private video library’s: and that would be VLC aka VideoLAN. Video LAN as in Local Area Network, where we could network several home computers, share all of the media libraries, create multitudes of playlists and then have ongoing movie play back for days and days and years even.  And wouldn’t such an app require a remote control for us couch potato types? Enter VLC Remote.  Now we could have access to every of the cool features of VLC, change aspect ratio, language, alternate streams, we could play back DVDs, Blu-ray’s, MKV, FLV, AVI, WMV, MP4, MOV, and many other obscure formats that (OGG) all play back beautifully from one app.  I had the privilege of beta testing this app for a couple of years and a lot of the cool features in this app I remember discussing, in fact the way that it is now is the direct result of a core group of us who used to bounce ideas back-and-forth between us and the developer. Who is a great guy and he even put out a “VLC remote classic” for me and one other person and I still have that installed in one of my devices.   There was even a “headset mode“, an EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE with skull and cross bones warning, which works actually pretty well except that you have to manually sync up the audio on the hand devices to what’s playing on the TV, but it does give you a way of having a headset on from 20 feet away and you don’t have to have a 50 foot headphone cable (😂). Is headset mode still there? YES! I was just using it.  These days most of the cool things that we were able to do with VLC we can now do with Plex media server, and so I feel badly that from my perspective this app has fallen along on the wayside to the point where my iOS 11 App Store automatically offloads the app on occasion ☹️.  But whenever I do finally fire up VLC on my home network, I still use this app to manipulate it rather than having to get off my rear end, drag my butt over to the computer and mess with the interface there, in fact the combination of VLC Remote and Mobile Mouse gives me the ability to fire up VLC from Mobile Mouse 🐁 🐭 and then I can move to VLC remote to access the app.  Lately the developer has been creating something called the ChillRemote which actually can give you a Remote for things like Netflix and Amazon and YouTube and it works pretty well, my only complaint with that is that it has a subscription feature to give you access to more features of the app and I loathe and despise subscription features. Mostly because that most developers that instigate a subscription use it to immediately bilk their former users out of a lot more money than the paid features usually cost in a one time payment. Rob does not do that though. He doesn’t ask very much for the subscription for ChillRemote, but I hate the concept of subscriptions, especially if it includes removal of advertisements which used to be a $.99 in app purchase for most apps.  Had to rewrite this whole review from scratch because I had a respring right in the middle of it 😡😡☹️😡😡🐁"
"159",297244048,"Purchased this app to play *.flac files and to use as a standin for the iPhone remote app from apple. When this app works, it is nice. I don’t think this app is ready for prime time. I used the free app for one day and figured I’d upgrade to be able to browse and add files. When I add files from the app, the playlist function fails and reverts back to the first song in the media player’s library (as listed). Essentially you cannot choose to start somewhere in the song listing and listen sequentially: the player automatically reverts to first song. Also, the volume function works only when not editing a playlist/song list. Once you load new songs and try to play those, volume control is lost. People say this app is better than Apple’s Remote (which has its quirks) but this makes VLC Remote not worth the $5 upgrade. Stay on the free version because it actually works as advertised. Very disappointed."
"160",297368629,"The best app. Easy to use, nice presentation and super useful! And the most important, it work!"

"164",297430070,"When you do a key word search on the app, the result does not show accurate.  Also, the menu category is not clear."
"165",297430070,"I always loved the app but for about a year now I’ve noticed that every time you scan something in the store the price will be different than it is in the store (usually lower). When I said something about it at the register they informed me that you can’t price match even though it’s on YOUR STORES APP. It just seems dumb, maybe remove that feature if you can’t figure out how to make the prices accurate to what it is in the store."
"166",297606726,"I love this, but I just recently changed phones now I find I can’t continue my game. I worked hard to get what little I got and now I’m losing interest cause I have to start over. 😔😒"
"167",297606726,"I bought this game and like it for the most part. The graphics are beautiful and game play is relaxing. My one beef is that when I stop time and then come back over half my fish are dead! This is not supposed to happen. So it is frustrating in that aspect. Please fix this bug."
"168",297606726,"I'm screaming. This is like OG fish tycoon from my childhood"

"173",297694601,"Did a search for best skate games looking for something like the old Tony Hawk games. Despite the good reviews, this game isn't very good at all. It's no fun to play. It has. There's no flow, no perspective, no fun feeling of skating. I tried Skate Party 2 and it was free and much better. Still hoping to find a better one but don't waste your money like I did on this app. It makes me want a 24 hour return policy or something similar. Waste."
"174",297694601,"The app is too expensive and limited. I'd much rather play True Skate."
"175",298127110,"Love to use this app but 2 things I see every day that would make it better. That is being able to start and stop a video that’s in pro presenter! Right now you can only do it at the computer not on the app but also being able to use the Bible button on the app too. Right now you have to go to the computer and look a verse up."
"176",298127110,"I’ve used it multiple times as I take photos and run ProPresenter. I connect to same WiFi and the computer. Sometimes it comes up and I can access the playlists other times it doesn’t come up at all."

"178",298206806,"I really like the app, and purchased it for both Android and iOS, but in iOS it is not letting me bring the iReal Pro email attachment into to iReal Pro on my iPad by pressing and holding on the attachment as the directions call for.   The above is the only function that I’ve found is NOT working at this point, but I’d really like to get it working. Bob"

"184",298867247,"It’s clear that Chase prioritizes features based on how it’ll make them more money through in-app up-selling rather than building features that actually make mobile banking simpler for their customer base.   Basic features like searching, filtering and sorting always seem to go ignored for features like getting an auto loan. Really - how often do you need an auto loan compared with filtering for the checks you’ve written, searching for a vendor or transaction quantity, or sorting based on transaction type?    The hamburger menu is an unruly bit of navigation hell. Please, don’t let every team add crap in there just cause they have a new thing to sell.   Oh, and for god’s sake fix the in-app alerts. If you are going to notify my that I have an in-app alert:communication - tell me where it is. Don’t make me guess if the alert is under Security or one of the accounts I have with you. I don’t have time to guess.  If the button marked “Today’s Insights” means what it says, is it necessary to include a badge ... that basically never ever, ever goes away. It’s infuriating that you are willing to use underhanded psychological tricks to get people to use this feature.  I’d leave Chase just because their UI is such a mess if it were an option."

The negative is on my iPhone 6S it under states the distance traveled, it may be that I use it in airplane mode and low battery mode that reduces the sample rate. It has an annoying message that I’m not connected to the internet. And I wish I could enter a LAT-LON into the search address field without internet."

Receiving my credit score regularly & being able to create a budget within the app are also great features. However sometimes the category is wrong on recurring transactions that have been previously specified & to fix them, and therefore the accuracy of the budget, requires manual changes on every transaction. So an improvement to that would definitely make Mint a 5 star app for me. For now I would even say it’s more like a 4.5."

"209",300265786,"I upgraded to pro within the app, it has some glitches like i can only control my computer volume only when i open chrome or an app it can control from the dashboard, volume buttons used to work well to control the volume so no need to use app interface, that seems not to work in this update, i used to have an issue where it would loose connection/not find my mac, thats good now... i bought app when came out for a 1$ not the price it is today hence why im ok with the issues and quite satisfied."

"245",304871603,"I had this app on my moms phone as a 2-5 year old before she got a new one, just found it again, and still love it!  yeah short review for it :l"
"246",304871603,"I love this app! It is easy to use and understand. My pictures come out awesome!  I highly recommend it! Woot!"
"247",304871622,"I played this since 2013 when it was first ported to Android. The updated controls make the game more comfortable to play on an iPad. It was fun revisiting this classic. This game is definitely not for small children though."
"248",304871622,"First of all, I want to say thank you so much for an amazing game. I’ve been playing this game since 2013 but I went to upgrade the chainsaw but I didn’t receive my Solar Ray 3000 Gun. Every time I make a purchase after the level is complete I just receive more gas and no upgrade."
"249",304871622,"I just bought the application and I get the surprise that it is not compatible with iPhone xr, do an update please."
"250",304878510,"I love what you can do on Skype.  But going mobile is a hassle.  Very complicated to navigate where to paste the phone number (because accessing the contacts takes forever) and it takes a lot of patience to wait until the paste option is  shown so I can paste the phone number.   Once I paste the phone number I can make the call immediately."
"251",304878510,"The app us slow on a mobile and awkward on a laptop. Unexplained delays while entering numbers and instructions. The call quality is generally pretty good but getting there is not"
"252",304878510,"Skype works well around the world, but what used to be simple and a joy to use has become bloated and often annoying, on both mobile and desktop."
"253",305343404,"Good"
"254",305343404,"Lift the adult content ban and everything will be cool. Let the ban stand and this app will continue to be trash. That simple."
"255",305343404,"I got nuked without being told what was wrong, and what I could potentially change. They also delete any sideblogs you have? All my friends are dead and there are still pedophiles. 2.2/10"
"256",305557780,"This ap used to work great, now both both face frames show on each opened pic, (confirmed does this even if only one person in each photo so AE isnt recognizing two faces)  No longer works, even though I paid for the full version, and confirmed up to date."
"257",305557780,"Where is the iphone x support??? So hard to use the app Since its not fit to screen with the iphone x screen. Plus u guys need to update the app!"
"258",305557780,"I found this app useful for a variety of applications along with swapping faces.  It can remove imperfections accidentally caught on photographs, uncomplimentary blemishes on faces, a misaligned ear or hairline, and even remove a bright light and other background distractions from an otherwise appealing photograph.  It is one of my favorite apps.  Serves as a mini Photoshop."
"259",305939712,"It says nothing about this on the App Store but unless you pay it’s useless. People like me or even message me but I can’t even see who has liked me or messaged me unless I have premium. I’m not paying for a dating app when it’s not gonna introduce me to people who aren’t already on Grindr, Tinder, etc. If you don’t want to spend $10+ a month then don’t even bother"
"260",305939712,"If you’re between the ages of 21-30 , honestly don’t waste your money. 90% of the people on here are in their 40s or older."
"261",305939712,"Maybe I shouldn’t fault the app as the dating pool is typically trash anyway.  Maybe I’m just giving my review on dating. But this app is horrible. You HAVE to pay in order to see ANY messages.  You can’t match unless you pay. And the one time rate us so insanely expensive that you gravitate towards the 3 month service for a little less than double the price if the one month.  While I can’t hold match responsible for the plethora of unattractive men and complete creeps, maybe they draw that type in.  I, out if boredom and loneliness, learned a $75 lesson today. Don’t match.com. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
"262",306169895,"My daughter absolutely loves this app and has worked greatly with her hand-eye coordination. The only problem we have is when she drags a letter or figure from the box in the top right hand corner of the screen, my iPhone notification screen swipes up and covers the game up. Its very frustrating to her. She would play it more if this issue was fixed somehow."
"263",306169895,"I do not usually leave reviews but I wanted to here. I got the free version for my son a few years ago. Within a few weeks we bought the full version. He loves it to this day and still plays it when he can. It is wonderful to keep a busy five year old engaged."
"264",306169895,"My son loves playing this game. Especially the interactive puzzles. Love that there are different ones and they have added more."
"265",306257910,"It's a great app and the sync for family sharing works very well. I would like to suggest to add an option to type and auto-suggest already entered payee names. Since we travel a lot, our list of payees is very long. Not being able to type and auto suggest the existing payee makes it very time consuming to keep scrolling through the list."
"266",306257910,"I’ve been using this app for about 3 years now and I’m very happy with how it’s allowed me to manually track m expenses and balance my bank account month to month.  Some improvements I would like to see would be some tweaks in the “transfer” areas. First of all, it’d be nice to have a little more confirmation of a completed transfer. Like maybe a next screen that shows the completed transfer. Just something with a little more visual feedback so mistakes aren’t made. Also with this, I’d love the option to include transfers as a budgeted expense. For example it’d be nice to add a transfer into the budget in order to track that as an “expense” and have it all together. But maybe this could be optional unlike a typical expense. This would help a lot with people like me that want to have a zero-based budget where we budget out 100% of our expenses including savings.  I would also love the addition of some realt-time feedback in the ""split categories"" menu so that I can see (after putting the first category and amount) how much is remaining from the original dollar amount so that I don't have to do math in my head and memorize the numbers!"
"267",306257910,"This is the best app for doing a manual budget. Anytime I try a different app, I always come back to this one.  You can make a simple budget or a complex budget with this app.  I like the sync feature.   Please bring iCloud sync support."
"268",306621789,"Keep up the good work."
"269",306621789,"Huffington post is missing the boat on this apps functionality. The ability to follow certain comment threads or even quickly find yours is not really an option."
"270",306621789,"Constantly slipping left and right when i am just trying to scroll down. I am on an iphone 8 with 256g and app often locks up. Disappointed a once great app has become a bloated, slow piece of annoyance-ware. I miss the slim, trim app that used to just work."
"271",306628397,"Really fun game except when it’s depressing like sex crimes"
"272",306628397,"THANK YOU for this game!!!! So cute so fun. Have never heard some of these phrases  lol"
"273",306628397,"Send"
"274",306937053,"needs a wraparound setting"
"275",306937053,"I’ve had this App on my devices for years and I always come back to it. IMO, it’s the best minesweeper for iOS because it’s so down to earth and - in the best sense - simple. I will amend my review to five stars as soon as the developers manage to fix that pesky bug that sometimes delays the posting of a flag, especially and mostly on the right side of the largest playing field."
"276",306937053,"Keeps bugging me for a review after every match. Well, here it is."
"277",307132353,"Thank for making this game. Played it years ago and still do so today. Deleting all the history and starting again.  I feel like this game and ranch rush are the best 2 games i’ve played. I would love more games like these please. This would be cool to play under the new ios. If that doesn’t happen , its cool. I love this one.  Thank you Games Cafe!"
"278",307132353,"I’m very disappointed that I bought this game and they refuse to create more levels."
"279",307132353,"this game its so fun"
"280",307184892,"What have you got against replays and Spectrum?"
"281",307184892,"Is there a way I can have an add-free version?"
"282",307184892,"Not mentioned until you try to stream it live. I get CBS just fine with an antenna."
"283",307354030,"I hate this game"
"284",307354030,"I have had so much fun with this app! It’s sooooo funny! Simple to use and very fun. No problems as far as I’ve had it. I definitely recommend this app if you are looking to have a good laugh with friends and family."
"285",307354030,"Amazing app"
"286",307386350,"First off, you have to be connected to the same network as your box to even be able to watch something on your phone which totally defeats the purpose. Secondly, even when I am at home I can never get the app to function properly to watch on phone when someone is watching something else."
"287",307386350,"I don’t have total access plz fix it. I have been missing games for about two years now."
"288",307386350,"best app"
"289",307569751,"Challenging, fun, exhilarating at times     and exercises the mind."
"290",307569751,"I had to stop playing Words With Friends because I was an addict. Now I am in danger of becoming a Crossword addict. So I have to limit myself to one new mini, one archived mini, one new daily and one archived one per day. Otherwise...  I am slowly getting the hang of the crazy clues that make you think around two or three corners. Good for the gray cells!"
"291",307569751,"I often play old Sunday puzzles over the course of a week or 2 for brief intervals in the evenings. I used to be able to view my puzzle history and resume the last puzzles I was playing easily, but I don’t see that option anymore. I also like to do easier puzzles in between when I work on a Sunday one. I need to be able to get back to the puzzles I was working on without having to to memorize the exact month and week of the one I had been doing. This is going to make the way I like to use the app very inconvenient :("
"292",307727765,"I love this game but the ads you’ve been running today are completely inappropriate. Why am I receiving ads saying “You’re being deported by U.S immigration” and then some other ad showing sperm with the title “How long are you going to live?” This is a child’s video game. You need to be more mindful of the ads you guys run."
"293",307727765,"Doodle jump is the game you play when your bored and you have nothing to do"
"294",307727765,"I don’t have much to say.This game is so fun and hard to stop playing."
"295",307741537,"I’ve had this app for I think almost 10 years now. Still updating it. Great app. Would be extremely useful if u made a watch version........"
"296",307741537,"I like it for sending silent messages in rooms where there are other people but you don’t want to attract attention to yourself"
"297",307741537,"Also it would better if you add displaying current time , it will be a nice clock."
"298",307764057,"NOTE: If you have an Apple TV, NicoNico does have a stripped down an app for it, but you need to grab it through iTunes Japan. Ironically, it’s easier to wrestle with than the unfriendly iPhone app.  I've been trying for years to access my NicoNico account to view the live concerts I joined their premium service for, across both Kindle Fire (semi-Android/proprietary OS) and my iPhone, to no avail. Crash after crash the moment I launched content. That's finally fixed. I watched my first concert marathon broadcast on this app this morning. Excellent. Now only if they made finding the live broadcasts schedule and bookmarking them easier on mobile (notoriously difficult). And corrected the site and app international event time/date glitches (been happening since 2012). And optionally offered the form notices that users see often in English for non-fluent viewers out there.   Well, at least the app finally works."

"300",307764057,"Nico Nico Douga is a really fun app to use to watch videos and everything else. Although in the description about this app, it said that there were other languages to choose from within the app. I could not find that option! I can get around some Hiragana and Katakana....but I have no idea what everything else says otherwise.   Please fix this issue if possible, if English or any other language is FOR SURE NOT AVAILABLE, then I would highly suggest to remove the “other languages included” from the description so that other customers will not have this confusion. Thank you so much!"
"301",307906541,"Where my points be at, trick?"
"302",307906541,"This app is easy to use and it took just a matter of seconds to figure out what theater we want to go to."

"305",308111628,"You can configure this app in so many ways."
"306",308111628,"This was a great app and one of my favorites, however it has been totally broken since the latest update. Every time I try and open the app, it crashes immediately. Hopefully there is a fix in the works!"
"307",308339980,"I like this game on how you can mess around with  ragdolls . But it dose need more to do"
"308",308339980,"This game is great and love the physics but there has to be more stuff like to be able to shoot a character with a gun or there has to be more characters than just 4. Like add a soldier or police to make the game more fun"
"309",308339980,"I used to like the game however got bored of it in like 3 days because there was not much to it,no obstacles or weapons or any thing besides throwing around a rag doll,u had a great thing going but then u just gave up on this project!!!!! The game has so much potential but u just left the drawing thinking that everything was fine in the game.over all great game but u need to add more things and I’m speaking for almost everyone who wrote a review on this app at all😑"
"310",308368164,"I did enjoy the"
"311",308368164,"Pro Loqutogo is a God send, it really helps my independence, that makes me happy and proud to schedule my appointments and my bus schedules to go to work or other errands countless times. It’s easy to learn. Thanks,  Neil Francois"
"312",308368164,"Proloquo2 is my son’s voice. I am so grateful he has words through this app on his device! He can tell me how he is feeling, whether he wants to be by himself or have me near, he can order his own food, ask for a break or the bathroom, and unlike the PECs we used to use, we can add more words on the spot as needed or desired. The communication I have with my child through Proloquo2 is priceless!"

"319",309025938,"this game-changing app allowed me to watch EVERY SINGLE SHOT from every single player on the course. mind-blowingly perfect. the video coverage was second to none. wish ALL the tournaments would adopt this platform."
"320",309025938,"Love this app. Watched the featured pairings every morning, until coverage aired, through my Apple TV, via my phone. Interactive features were really nice as well. Sorry to hear others rating this app had such poor/bad experiences. No issues at all with mine."
"321",309025938,"I found myself jumping back to this app even near the tournament end due to the flexibility of watching particular holes or a featured group with no commercials. CBS seems to have abandoned the “limited commercial interruptions” we have come to enjoy in previous years. Yes it lacks the polish of the broadcast production and gave it 4 stars due to audio problems like echoing. However, it was wonderful to see it on the big TV screen through my Apple TV. I wish they would do it for all majors but am happy it is available for my favorite."

"328",309465525,"Great options, gifts! I love the option to pick up locally."
"329",309465525,"I love Shutterfly. Using the App is sometimes frustrating because it takes too long to upload photos and build your project. But you won’t get a better deal anywhere!  Plus 101 free photos is amazing."
"330",309465525,"As an amateur photographer, I have used Shutterfly extensively , both as a source of printed photographs and to share images with a softball league. I have never been disappointed with the quality of the work or the speed with which items are shipped."
"331",309527804,"I used to enjoy this game on the iPod, and just tried this newer version. The game play doesn’t work as described in the tips so you fail, repeatedly.  Example 1: “capture one invader at a time and build up your number of prisoners”. No, the game only lets you put one invader in the prison until it goes away. Example 2: “double tap the tent to train a prisoner to be an archer”. No, the game doesn’t seem to recognize double taps. Example 3: “slam invaders into catapults to destroy them”. While you can slam invaders to the ground this has no effect on machines."
"332",309527804,"...and it is STILL being updated. I bought this one my 3G and am playing it on my X. Great job."

"334",309735670,"The search results never pertain to what is written in the search box. This, if possible, has gotten worse!  Also if a job doesn’t apply to you or you are not interested why can’t they give you the option to stop it from showing up in your searches again and again.   Ex everything I have written... I wrote that I was looking for an accountant position and the search results pulls up a delivery person!!!! How backward is that!!!"
"335",309735670,"More job variety consistently! Quick feedback and smooth communication with employers. Resume magic is a great feature. Indeed is the best job search app on the market bin my opinion"
"336",309735670,"Just updated this app and it won’t let me click on my recent searches. 😭"
"337",310303959,"This game has the same control problems most table tennis games have. The concept doesn’t translate well to a touchscreen. Fine for a dollar. The in app stuff is annoying but standard. Ultimately, a little disappointing but it’s a good try; maybe, one of the better table tennis sims on the App Store."

There is no update.  everytime have to go the play store and find it out then have to use it.  can you guys fixed this problem. I even  cant uninstall it.  I dint wnat to use it anymore. What to do suggest it. PlZ"

"343",310636441,"I absolutely love this app, it is probably one of the most used apps on my phone during the school year. I love the notifications it sends and how I can put all my yearly assignments in one place. I feel like it helps to keep me organized by having all my classes and due dates in one place.  But some things that I don’t like about this app are the fact that you cant mark an assignment as complete, you either have to delete that assignment or it gets marked as ‘Overdue’. Another thing I don’t like is the fact that your schedule on the app doesn’t give you an option to connect to a Google calendar only your Calendar Events can connect to your IOS calendar without even asking."
"344",310636441,"I have been using this app for 8 years and it always had my back. Every teacher, assignment, and class imputes and used for 13 distinct semesters. You can’t trust your brain to remember every class time but iStudiez sending me notifications and syncing with my calendars made it easy.  Every assignment or test inputed on my phone at the end of class easily synced to all my devices. I would pull up the app on my computer to ensure I never forgot an assignment. This only happened maybe 7 times total in 8 years because of this app.  I could easily contact teachers by inputting their email at the start of the semester too. My biggest fear was the app would stop being updated but the team at iStudiez instead always strived to add more features and make the app better. They continue to do so and I am now sad to leave the app because I have officially graduated college.   This is my first review ever. I’m writing it because I want to thank the whole team from the bottom of my heart. You all got me through school just as much as my teachers, friends, and family. Keep changing students lives for the better.  Thank you ❤️"
"345",310636441,"I installed the app recently and I found it very useful.  I would like that, when adding an exam, you could select the class schedule without entering the date and time manually."
"346",310738695,"I am officially boycotting zillow. While their app was useful for finding a home, moving into the real estate business and putting realtors out of work is not for me. I noticed that they are now promoting the houses they buy first, charge way higher rates for commission and below market prices when they purchase the home. I am done with you Zillow."
"347",310738695,"There was a time when Zillow attempted to value homes independently but now all you do is copy the price of whatever a property is listed for or has sold for; plus or minus $5-10. Zillow used to lead this field but you have lost your way. I no longer use Zillow as my primary real estate tool.   Rob"
"348",310738695,"Useful app but not always mobile friendly."

"350",310951782,"Is it just me? The 450 bikes sound like 2 strokes and the 125 and 250’s sound like 4 strokes? I also have to give the other bikes a 10 to 12 second lead on the hard level and i still win with 5 lap race. Would also see motocross tracks added. And yes I reinstalled the game several times."

"352",311466554,"The September update is a little goofy.. having to wait through the animated logo every time the app opens is meh.   The new button click sounds are so loud that I had to turn the music up to 90% and the button sounds down to like 10% in the mixer.   One thing I have wanted for a long time is a way to type search and select specific weapons in the target practice mode. Scrolling through 300 weapons manually every time you want to test out a specific scenario with a weapon before you make the actual shot during an online game is cumbersome to say the least.   An update/option to have 5 or more moves back or forward would be great and more fun.   Been playing for 16 years. Thanks for the fun game! Keep it up!"
"353",311466554,"This game has kept me entertained for a very long time Just recently I’ve gotten back to playing it and I continue to wince as I hover my finger over the fire button hoping to hit my opponent.  Please never stop making this game great."

"371",312343159,"This is a great series of games. You must stay on your toes or it will take you forever, if you don’t quit in frustration first. Enjoy and seriously, challenge your friends. Maybe you won’t feel so dumb."
"372",312343159,"I thought this game was awesome! Although I really enjoy it there are a couple of suggestions that I would like you to read... when you unlocked extra levels for the holidays I completed them but the n when the holiday was over they disappeared! It was just really disappointing. Another thing is that sometimes at the beginning of the game it won’t let me click on the 100 apples sign even when I really need it! Other than that I thought it was a super fun game! Wait one more thing more levels more levels more levels! I know this will be a review that no one reads but please think about my comment. Love your game and I hope you have a good day."
"373",313199385,"Love this game! I used to play it everyday when I was a kid! Just re-downloaded it! I wish I could give it more stars!"
"374",313199385,"i don’t usually ever write a review for apps but i just couldn’t resist with this one. to put it simply, this game was my childhood !! my sister and i were talking about memories on a road trip and she brought the game up and it brought back so many good memories, we looked around and found it !!! we’ve been playing so much and let me tell you, this is the best purchase i’ve made all year ahahaha"
"375",313199385,"Worst game I’ve ever played it glitches to much and it runs you into the animals on purpose the game is point less save your time and don’t download this app 😡😡😤😤"
"376",314506629,"This game try’s to teach go but I. Truth all it does is force you into frustrating positions it does not explain the rules at all and expected new players to beat a fairly good ai with no knowledge. what wins you can get seem like it wanted you to win so in conclusion if you are experienced go ahead this is fine but if you are New don’t even consider this app"
"377",314506629,"I nearly destroyed my phone. This game does not teach you anything it just crushes you or resigns after 3 moves.  Pointless.  2 stars for the design."
"378",314506629,"Description says it contains a tutorial but I can’t find one. I’ve never played Go and when I installed it it just started me immediately on a board playing myself. There isn’t a step by step guide of how to play. Searching through the app I found a list of rules but it’s more like a whole written manual than a step by step guide. I feel like the description is misleading. It doesn’t actually teach you how to play. You already have to know the rules and the basic concepts to get anything out of this app. If you are an absolute beginner, this isn’t for you."
"379",314716233,"When I had my phone stolen on a vacation and already having the phone service Text  now on my computer has literally saved my life and sanity, With this ability to use this phone service I  was able to call with the service in a period of a short time ,my cell phone company to report the stolen phone, call my boyfriend who got so concerned due to my phone loss and all the details , notify my work place ,was able to call my family to let them know of my stolen phone.and especially my friends who I had plans with hoping not miss out on if no replacement cell phone was available quickly for the timing was not the greatest to have my phone stolen .Text Now helped me to be able to connect ..This has been a  wonderful service !"
"380",314716233,"Love this app, even better for business, so employees and employers can’t have my private number. Please, fix it to where I can delete all the numbers at once or how many I want. Then would be a solid 5. Definitely keeping this app on my phone. Thank you 👋🏿"
"381",314716233,"This is an amazing app to have but I think that you should one fix some bugs and when loading the app it should be all gray it should be like opening any app and two I thing you should add some more message notification sounds like the bell tone for iphone"

"390",314864297,"How can the oldest version of your game still be comparable with the latest version but not your sequel?  Please update I Dig it 2 for iOS 11 I love that game and as a paying customer we need an update. Please and thank you."
"391",315021242,"7/7/19- I’ve had this game for a long time and it never disappoints. The dev’s have done a great job of keeping it zen, beautiful, running smoothly, and stocked with puzzles. And they haven’t given in to the current ugly AppStore trend of greedy and manipulative cash grabs.  Hats off to you guys, job well done. 🎩🎩🎩"
"392",315021242,"Played in the beginning. Some upgrade found me without. Years later I remembered and decided to download again. Still a great game but the developer has sold out to the ad world and you now suffer ads with tiny ‘X’s’ that have you opening a site when you try to close. Just another “give me money and screw the customer” app.   Deleted!"
"393",315021242,"Simple idea, easy to learn, yet hard to master. And the best thing is that the developers have been keeping up the game throughout all the iOS updates. So many good games lost by updates. And this little game that does NOT need Internet (thank you, developers) is still here. Had for a few years."
"394",316025912,"The game is awesome. Easily the best version of Sonic 1 ever. My only real gripe is that I bought the game back when is was still pay to play and I'm forced to deal with the ads that were put in place when the game became free. The problem isn't just with this game, I have the same issue with Sonic 2, Sonic CD, and Sonic 4. Restoring my purchase doesn't seem to fix it either."
"395",316025912,"I love having this game so readily available on my iPad, but having additional control options, like having the Smart Keyboard, or any keyboard controls for the game would make it perfect."
"396",316025912,"This would be a really great game IF when you paid the $2 to remove the ads the ads actually left. Sonic 2 doesn’t seem to have the same issue, but I’ll be requesting a refund for this one."
"397",316227296,"It is already a great game! One thing that would make it better would be a slo motion after all plays with a screen tap, not just the strikes. Set up so you could adjust it in the settings menu. Turn on and off whatever features you wanted."
"398",316227296,"Really a great game, keeps stats, play cards, what more can want?"
"399",316227296,"I’ve had this game for years, on multiple iPhone and iPad generations, and I appreciate the developer’s commitment to keeping the game alive through numerous iOS updates. Still looks good and feels responsive. Still great fun for a quick game or extended play."

"412",318639200,"Fun but you can’t use all your collected weapons in all the areas. There is one castle in particular that can’t be beat with a single throw. If I could use weapons from other conquests, it wouldn’t be an issue. It seems the older version would allow it but not this version. I want to be able to use any of my earned weapons on ANY castle."

"414",318639200,"This is the game if you want to simply throw projectiles at block castles. The different types of projectiles and blocks are easy to figure out, so it comes down to strategy and aim rather than pay-to-play special items with weird effects. The graphics are great (minus some silly optional prize skins), like real blocks and soldier figurines. Miles above the alleged “crush the castle siege master” game that stole its name."
"415",319204550,"This is the worst major golf app I have ever seen!!!!!!

"416",319204550,"I didn’t have any issues with the app crashing but I do have a HUGE issue that of the 3 viewing choices available to watch on the app, NONE showed the leaders unless you saw them on the 3 holes that were featured. Why wouldn’t you work in the the leaders throughout the day instead of groups that were 6-8 strokes behind?"
"417",319204550,"Crashes constantly... soo much that its almost not worth using.  Worst part,  coverage on final round ended with the leaders having 3 holes to play... coverage was on guys not even in the top 10 but didnt cover the top 4 players at all on the final day of the US Open!!!!   Are you kidding me??  This is totally maddening.  Its like watching game 7 of the NBA finals with the score tied and a minute left then ending coverage.  You could have screwed up everything else and i wouldnt have been upset but this... i never leave reviews but this was pretty ridiculous."

"421",319295332,"Every time I open the app I’m greeted with a full screen add that sometimes automatically tries to get me to subscribe to something. This is only app on my phone that actually gets worse with time. I just want to listen to internet streams and not be bothered with banners and offers of additional services. Also, minor complaint but Chromecsst support seems potentially broken as it only sees half the speakers other apps see. I have a ton so it might be actually capping at some number."
"422",319295332,"This app is outstanding. I have used it to increase my music collection and I use it to listen to MSNBC.  It is a must when traveling in my car. It’s versatility is amazing.

However, I stop playing after about the third generation because there’s nothing left to do once we reach that point... the game needs more to it. Some suggestions: daily goals, market and store refreshing more often, holidays, ability to travel to extra locations (I.e. vacation, store, date night locations). It looks like there hasn’t been an update in a year so I doubt this will be read or acted upon but I hope I’m wrong because this game has A LOT of potential."

Poor updates on the app told me there were as many as three groups on the same hole and was often several holes behind. Didn’t even have the correct players playing together more than once on Wednesday. I know that there were no official groups or times for the practice rounds but you think someone on the first and tenth tees could have updated the groups.

Great to track health and be able to provide care providers accurate information that doesn’t require crumpled bits of paper. Or I can email and print detailed, customized reports of anything in the app. Well worth the money spent. And switching between children is a so easy. And it is still being updated which is a big bonus in my book. Thanks."
"501",326574411,"Timeline is confusing because it tracks activities (sleep, feeding) using actual hours as they are spread over the day’s. For example, a part of the night sleep is often shown on one day’s events (eg 8pm - 12am) and another part (12am - 6am) on the next day’s events. Although accurate, this is not super helpful because I cannot clearly see how much my child slept, or ate, or how often they got up, on any given night.  Also, when entering data, certain data entered resets itself when you try to adjust another data set. For example, if I don’t want to time bottle feeds but just want to enter oz, by the time I’m done adjusting all, the begin time resets back to current time, forcing me to reenter the begin time.  This is annoying."

"503",326876192,"epson designs their printers in a disposable fashion - the print heads are not replaceable. in addition, your scanner will not function if there is a malfunction in the printing system. in other words, your so-called multifunction is some extras only so long as there remains the avenue of selling ink. and so, they are something of an illusion. if we are to stop being a throw away society, corporations will have to start selling products which are not intentionally disposable."

"505",326885152,"Ok the reason I downloaded this app was because it was on my school iPad. I wanted to see how much the other book thing were.$ 1.99. But after 3 stories this beeping started. And on my school iPad it did the same. Then I started lagging. Plz fix and I have a lot of penguins books!!"
"506",326885152,"I thought it was going to be really cool because I love Madlib’s and then for some reason I was saying pay for this pay for this pay for this and it wasn’t letting me not pay for it so I’m not downloading it ever again 😡😡😡😡😡?????!!!!!"
"507",326885152,"Don’t give me wrong I love mad libs but When it asks you for a month and the date It only lets you put in 2 Letters or numbers so I can put in the month I was born and it won’t let me continue until I do! Somebody help me please!!!😫😕🤨😢😡😤"

"517",327455869,"Enjoyed this app, it had everything I was looking for. Easy to use."
"518",327455869,"I have belatedly updated my USOpen.org 2019 app and found it (as of 9/7/2019) to be improved but still far from impressive in its design or its journalism.  Previously, I could not find match statistics that worked, or live radio. Both are fine now.   A new tab at the bottom of the screen leads to “Players.” Thank you. But why does it have only individual statistics, not individual bios? If you can’t write them, please at least link to Wikipedia.  Match previews are written cheerfully but inelegantly. They include outright typos like “Roger” Cup for “Rogers” and inexcusable coding in the middle of sentences, as in the following two paragraphs:  Serena: ""I've felt more prepared this tournament...?external=true I just feel like I've actually had time to train.""  Patrick Mouratoglou: ""...I?external=true think her movement now is better than I have ever seen since she became a mother.""  Apparently, these embarrassments were caused by ellipses, which should not be used anyway in feature interviews though they may be needed when quoting legal documents. The assumption is, readers understand that all quotes from oral interviews are excerpted. We KNOW Patrick said other things before (and after) this quote!  Slide shows of still photos are excellent technically and artistically but next to worthless journalistically because they lack captions describing the significance, if any, of the moment shown. Instead, a boilerplate caption is used on almost every caption: “So-and-so in action against so-and-so in the nth round,” etc. Your images obviously are selected for their design value, not their significance, which is nice, but we’ve all seen thousands and thousands of beautiful tennis stills. Video clips with interpretation on the soundtrack would be far more interesting, even for users who don’t play tennis.  Like the post-match stories, the photos emphasize the positive, becoming more like PR than journalism. That means this app cannot become a fan’s go-to place for all things US Open. Moreover, the mainstream media complete their postgame reports many minutes earlier than this app.   Maybe just give up on the journalism and become more like the website of a state legislature: schedules, outcomes and repositories of history. In addition, US Open could curate and amalgamate others’ journalism, as Apple News does."
"519",327455869,"Need to copy Wimbledon app for efficiency. With Wimbledon app the scores come slightly before play is finished on TV. My TV is older so I rely on apps to see the scores. The US Open app is so slow they can play another point before the score changes. Really sad. On the other hand—the info and bells and whistles are good."
"520",327630330,"I had a problem with this app that I didn’t subscribe to, but had problems getting help cancelling it. I was losing hope! But I promised to change my one-star rating if someone could help me cancel. I’d just come home from the hospital and was just so tired and sick! I received help from someone from Dropbox, and he said it’s cancelled! Thanks so much! I appreciate it so much. Blessings to you and I pray that other things go more smoothly. :)"
"521",327630330,"Phewt- bye and if you stay, I suggest you freeze updating.   Remember YOU are the product."
"522",327630330,"Not sure whether this problem is an Excel or DropBox app problem.  But yesterday i updated to Excel version 2.29.1 and now Excel freezes when attempting to download the last file i accessed in DropBox.  Attempting to cancel the download fails to cancel.  I have a financial file that is stored “in the app in the ipad folder” and i dont want to lose it. Is there anyway to access this file using another app and then making a copy of the file?  I had a similar problem several months ago and the problem was related to DropBox, so i saved the file on my ipad.  But now, Excel keeps attempting to access the last file accessed from DropBox, and so i cant get to the file on my ipad."

"524",328011357,"This is just the relaxing type of koi pond app I was looking for when my old favorite got outdated.  It is pretty, relaxing, and a little bit of fun, too. The fish and water move nicely, the splashing sound is good, and the flower/leaves are a fun accent."

"526",328205875,"Both my grandchildren love this app! They started when they were 2 years old. It’s delightfully fun, colorful and nice to see all the lunch objects are realistic, healthy fruits and veggies instead of candy that most kids' apps cater too. Enjoy!"
"527",328205875,"With a little practice, my 2 year old can play this app on her own. Love the variety of little games to learn colors, shapes, letters and counting. I wish they would occasionally add new content or mini games."
"528",328205875,"I love it sooooooo much"
"529",328415391,"App is great and super entertaining, the only major issue is the picture messaging on the chat, it hasn’t been working at all, is there a timetable for when this will be fixed? It’s super disappointing that updates continue to drop and this isn’t fixed, it’s a huge part of the app for trash talking, it should be at the top of the list for issues to fix! Get it done Yahoo!"
"530",328415391,"Still not entirely satisfied with the direction of this app. Too much clutter. I would happily pay for an advertisement free version. I want the app from two years ago. I really miss the black background or would prefer a night version.   It’s sad that when I go to my matchup, that less than 1/3 of my screen is what I need to see. I have to close out advertisements just to see things. Soo annoying."
"531",328415391,"I’ve used the app for five years. Just recently it has started freezing up on me half the time or fails to load. I have never iphoneX."

"545",329981776,"Great App. Lots of fun!!  With the varying levels of difficulty, I can challenge myself or teach my 10-year-old to play. One game that fits all players needs."
"546",329981776,"Absolutely the best sudoku game on the internet. Straight to the point without any distracting graphics or unnecessary animations. Completely customizable so you can set the level of hints to your own liking. The puzzles range from super easy to diabolically difficult. The numbers are nice and big and the notes make the harder games easier to solve. I love sudoku and this app is just what I need to keep me sharp, challenged and entertained. The ad-free version is definitely worth all five stars."

"550",330803072,"Purchased the app for remote product photography in a studio using iPhone XS as the camera on a tripod, and iPad Pro as preview/controller. Pairing was iffy...Every time iPhone went to sleep or a pop-up would appear, iPad lost connection. Preview on iPad was pixelated, and the proportions were skewed. No way to crop to a square format like you can using iPhone camera app. No help menu. App lacks robust features. Waste of money and time!"
"551",330803072,"There seems to be no difference from normal ,far and macro mode. Also no current online help I could find to show feature."
"552",330803072,"This app is awesome and does almost exactly what I wanted it to. The only problem I have is that I can’t record in a high enough frame rate for smooth slow motion videos. This is troubling for me, as I planned to use it for exactly this. I wish I could offer a higher rating, but I feel this was the dealbreaker for me unfortunately."

"579",332568551,"Overall this app is amazing! There are soooo many different truths and dares so you never know what you or your friend will have to do next, but I do have a few suggestions, one suggestion is that you should update the design and update every once and a while so there’s new truths and dares."
"580",333180061,"Some great visuals and very simple controls, but I had completed every achievement in probably under 20 minutes. Seemed to encounter every type of obstacle well before that too.

"581",333180061,"😤😤 iPhone X has been out since 2017 folks. Plz update the app, should be a simple code tweak, just make it fill the bigger screens.   You’re working with a golden classic, give it the love it deserves."

So, I’m back to enjoying the app with ease. I just have to start all over again on my new phone. Which is fine. Thank you for all of your help and communication.   Update: I figured out the flip thru..but I would still like to be able to edit my bookmarks. I’d like to be able to look back by the subject I type instead of it just being the day.

"605",334989259,"I bought the app for 5$, I paid using my hard earned money and I expected to have everything after the recent update, they took features away and put them in their service. This should be pulled from the store."
"606",334989259,"Purchased the app forever ago. Developers removed the features I paid for and transitioned to a subscription model. I used to use this app every day for step by step solutions for calc until they removed the features I PAID FOR."
"607",335029050,"When trying to register for online play, I’m getting an error saying the email is already associated with an account. I’ve tried four different emails that I know have never been used and still getting error. This is my first time using the app ever so I know I don’t have any accounts. Frustrated."
"608",335029050,"Good game if you play with other humans.  Representative of the real article. Only drawbacks are:  1) Symbols are a bit hard to see/interpret on a smaller screen (phone) but not an issue on a tablet.   *2) The rampant use of “computer cheating” if you are playing solo. Anytime you’re a victory point ahead of the others, numerous 7s will be rolled, Knight cards will be played, and no one will trade cards with you. The robber never moves anywhere but your spaces regardless of other considerations. Absurdity isn’t even close to an accurate word."
"609",335029050,"Overall, this is a good rendition of the board game Catan. The board game rules are adhered to (except that the computer decides without rolling the dice who puts down their first settlement), and the dice rolls are mostly fair and realistic (though in one game, the robber was rolled about a third of the time and no 8s were ever rolled). I’ve heard from other reviews that the dice tries to help the AI when you’re close to winning, and this is probably true to some extent, but I was still able to win a lot of the time. It’s also great how the different characters in the game have their own personalities and levels of skill, so you’re not playing against the same AI each time.   There is a problem with the distribution of development cards in the game. Once, I was in the lead by 3 points and one of the AIs somehow won by acquiring 5 victory-point cards in a row, even though there are supposed to be 5 one-victory-point cards in the game set and 25 development cards in total. It’s also very difficult to see what the AIs are trading, whether with each other or the bank. In general, the AIs seem to rely more on development cards than most real-life Catan players and often don’t build settlements when they could very likely be able to do so.  Otherwise, I would recommend buying this app if you rarely get to play the physical Catan board game."
"610",335047649,"This app simply doesn’t function as it should. All I need it to do is add contacts to my address book. However, it only recognizes a small portion of the text and the rest is gibberish.   I want my .99 back!"

Not sure if that has anything to do with the problem I’m experiencing but I’ve picked King of Dragon Pass back up and it will not let me view tribes in my relations screen or access it via the map screen. When I do try to view tribes it crashes the whole game and takes me back to my phones home screen. I’m at loss... it never did this before. Could it be an iOS update that messed it up? Please get back to me concerning this as I would appreciate it, immensely. Really enjoyed playing KoDP. Was a five star game, current problem withheld  UPDATE: Thank you so much for correcting the issues and in such a timely manner, developers. You’re appreciated greatly!"

"619",335709058,"My favorite part of the app is the style stats, especially the cost per wear stat. It’s also great to see what you wear most and least. I love the app for what it is.   However, the app needs CLOUD backup. The last time I got a new phone I lost everything and I was not able to restore a backup saved on my laptop. While I also wish I could go from phone to ipad via wifi (I gave up on the wifi accept, too cumbersome), I’d settle for a decent cloud backup. I’m still recreating pics from round one, and of course the stats too.   UPDATE: To be clear, I did set up my new phone from the iCloud backup. I did not set up as a new phone. Still lost all of the photos which is why I then tried to restore a backup on my computer. Neither worked to retrieve my photos.  And I had been regularly backing the old phone up to iCloud. So your response did not address my issue. There are multiple reviewers who appear to have had the same issue recently.   On the positive side I recently created looks for a business trip and then created a packing list from the looks. This works brilliantly."

"621",335709058,"I almost gave up, on this app when I began trying to photograph my clothes. However, now, I am using the app “Paper” by WeTransfer, and I can’t get enough of it! So much fun! I feel so girlie! (I am 73 years old) I use my iPencil to make some simple outlines in Paper, like, of T shirts, then color them in, save the image to photos, and it imports into Stylebook, no problem, nd doesn’t need the tedious erasing of the outline, etc.  the app really helps me find outfits right within my closet I hadn’t thought of before. I feel ‘clothes rich.’ The only downside is that it’s a very tempting procrastination tool...and when I wake in the middle of the night, I want to draw more clothes andd add them to Stylebook. It would be a great program for children who are ill and need to stay in bed. Creative! Next to YNAB, it is my favorite app....along with Paper."

Please make it available in the US app store so I can use freely. I won’t be changing my phones region on IOS just to download international NBA app please can you make it available on US app store  **************************************************  I live in saudi arabia but I have my country/region for my iPhone to the US as I use the US iTunes store a lot to make my entertainment purchases.  But unfortunately the NBA league pass subscription that I paid for on my macbook doesn’t work with the US app which is really frustrating. Therefore only on my laptop I can stream the games and even then the experience is pretty bad because when I click on full screen the screen will blink every other second.

And now I see that it’s updated with Bethesda’s new software... the controls are HORRENDOUS AND MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE! You cannot continuously fire, which means you have to double tap for every bullet of the chaingun, and you cannot use the plasma gun, and for anyone who has never played Doom before, that’s not me using that figuratively, you actually CANNOT use the plasma gun. I updated my phone and had to install this new version after deleting the old one a few months ago. I feel so stupid I deleted that version. I paid money for that old version and now I can’t play it, I no longer have access to Doom. Do not buy this game, other reviews that have higher than 1 star are all ones that are saying “I’m sure they’ll update it, I love Doom”, but that has not happened, save your money."

However I stopped using it, and cancelled it, because my phone battery couldn’t last for the amount of time I was running (I run ultra marathons of 50+ miles and switched to a Suunto watch). I received an email confirmation of my membership cancellation on 2/11/2019. However, I have recently been receiving more and more aggressive emails from them with statements like “We’ve already sent you three emails reminding you that the fee for your Runtastic Premium Membership is outstanding. Did you happen to see those? As you can see from the Runtastic Terms & Conditions, which you accepted, the Runtastic Premium Membership is renewed automatically.”  I cancelled my membership with them seven months ago and have an email confirmation of it from them. Why they continue to harass me for a membership payment is beyond me.  I loved their app and would give it a five star review, but getting harassed with threats for membership payments when I had clearly cancelled it lowers it to a one star review. Their emails make me think they are low on cash and are desperate to get money to keep the company afloat. We’ll see if they’re still around in a couple months."

Her writing has improved greatly, and she went from not counting at all to being a math super star within days.

Tested on an iPhone model SE: its also updated Shazam Encore app actually recognized the 1st attempted song immediately — THEN, NO JOY.

"662",337462979,"In settings there is an option to make the user spell from left to right. Everytime you select a letter, the app says it and then will spell the word and pronounce it. My three year is definitely engaged and will repeat the letters along with the app!"
"663",337462979,"4 thumbs UP!  (2 from me, 2 from the kid)  Our 3.5-year-old will easily sit half an hour playing this game (he would keep going if I'd let him).  I like its simplicity without extra fluff.  All the  setup options are very intuitive and straight forward too.  Our son kept picking letters out of order, and it was bugging the OCD in me.  So I went to settings, and there it was, the ""left to right"" option.  Tada!  We've only played the shapes category so far, but I like the variety that goes beyond the regular, way too common geometric shapes.   Having the Japanese option was actually the determining factor for us, and I would think any parents who are raising their children in one of the optional languages would really appreciate the multi-lingual function.   We had the free version for a long time but now that our son is really picking up on letters and sounds, we decided to get the full version even though I knew the app was old with no updates of late. But lo and behold, I was pleased to see that it was just updated a month ago! Yay!   The animation and the drawings are very basic, which can be improved, I suppose. I do however like the bold (again, simple in a good way) colors."

"665",337571576,"Acesome game. VERY realistic. Leads are accurate, and clay birds are well thought. It needs a larger variety of target presentations: teals, batous, rabbits, & chondels. It would be awesome if at the pro level you could get different targets. Keep in mind that this is a Sporting clays game, not skeet or trap. You wont regret buying it. Please give us some more targets and layouts!!!"

I have a couple of small suggestions: Move the settings option for the icon badge number out of “Tasks View Settings” to its own category, and include an option for the current date as a badge icon. The other suggestion would be to add a small, always visible icon to jump to the current date. Unless there’s a trick I don’t know about, the current process is to tap to display the share icon, tap the share icon, then tap a third time to jump to the current date. If adding the icon isn’t feasible, adding “Jump to Current Date” to the top of the “More” menu might be an option. Thanks for a great app!"

My only suggestion, and I don’t know if it’s even possible because we’re not in an analog world anymore, is to have a squelch feature so that you know that the stream is still working.

"714",342115564,"When I first downloaded Hipstamatic way back in prehistoric times, nothing else like it existed. I would even make the argument that this is still true.  When Instagram showed up on the App Store I thought, seriously? Who would want to take photos you can only share with other people with fewer options and ridiculously inferior quality? Turns out. I guessed the same thing with YouTube when it launched so hey, if you ever wanted to invest in a startup just don’t take my word for it.  Anyway. Hipstamatic hasn’t changed much over the years, and that has been one of its greatest assets. The boutique experience it provides (hipster, say) is seriously worth experiencing. It was my personal introduction to lomography, which eventually lead me to taking, developing, and printing my own physical photos.  I feel like this review is long overdue, especially because the quality and support is so consistent to this day. If you’re at all on the fence, just give it a shot. If you’re sick of only curating your life for social media, or even if you do want vastly superior shots for it, Hipstamatic has unparalleled freedom and is the way to go."

Simply use the search box to search by artist or song title.  HOW TO SING ANY/ALL SONGS FOR FREE:  If you want to sing any song for free, just type it into the search box and scroll through the results til you find one without the VIP tag.

I just really feel like it’s going a bit too far and I hope it doesn’t go any further at this point. If the extra revenue is necessary, all I can say is that sometimes more isn’t necessarily better, sometimes it’s just more in my opinion.

There’s still no better site on the web for reliable film and television data and the application reflects that same reliability in my opinion. That’s my soul reason for still giving the application four stars for excellence."

"731",343555245,"The worst experience. We had first class tickets from Germany to Italy on an EC. Tried to change to an earlier train. Apparently the app allows to change “seats” to a different train,  but not actual trains! So we ended up with seats on the earlier train and no actual train ticket.  The app needs to be a lot more clear about such distinctions. The conductor could do nothing to help except sell us second set of tickets with no seats. Another problem - why can’t the app show us where free seats are so we can reserve seats. Even conductor’s app could not show free seats so we and luggage were tossed from seat to seat for the next three hours."
"732",343555245,"The app shows some weird departure times when booking from non matching time zone because there are no indicators in what time zone things are presented.  Suggestion: show times in local (German time) time"

"736",343889987,"Not sure why so many net reviews and comments about American cards - maybe developers fixed all the issues   I. No problem setting up account. For US you do need to put the +1 in front of your phone number as indicated by format.   2. Took my US Chase card no problem when manually entered. It could not scan the card, but that’s no big deal   3.   I was unable to add someone as my “travel partner” - it said something went wrong. But I could simply add another passenger and it promoted me for name info later which worked fine.   4. I used the SNCF first to find what rain I wanted.  When i said “buy” it flipped me to this app - not quite sure why i needed SNCF at all - but maybe easier trip planning"
"737",343889987,"In its current form the Oui SNFC app contains a fatal bug that permanently disables all access to Apple Wallet. Any attempt to add a trip to Apple Wallet permanently freezes all access to your Apple Wallet. Additionally, if you attempt to select “Wallet & Apple Pay” within the iOS Settings app you will permanently disable all access to settings within the operating system as a whole. The issue is entirely reproducible and critical with respect to both the app and the APIs it uses. It also suggests a security issue in iOS itself since no single app should cause a permanent OS instability. Neither restarting and closing this app nor restarting the Settings app will restore access to Wallet and the operating system becomes permanently compromised simply by attempting to add a trip to Wallet in the OUI.sncf app."

This would greatly improve gameplay for me personally. I want to use the triggers to drive and shoot. Also the ability to control steering sensitivity is a must.

Discounts are granted based off estimated AGI at the start of the year, if your AGI ends up higher at the end of the year, you have to pay back the discount at tax time. And If you are over the amount to qualify, you pay it ALL back and end up owning THOUSANDS of dollars on your tax return. That single aspect can swing your tax refund in a huge way, and it’s not included in this app as far as I can tell.   Beyond that, it was easy to use and the interface was pleasant. Just totally inaccurate for our situation."

"772",348530331,"I have kept this app updated and tested it on three Apple devices - iPad Air, iPhone 6s and iPhone 8. On each, the problem is the same. I prefer not to use cellular data minutes to listen to podcasts and choose to download them while on WiFi. My app has cellular turned off for this app. The episodes appear to have downloaded and if I listen to a downloaded podcast while still in WiFi range, they work fine. If I am out of WiFi range when I launch a podcast that is listed as downloaded, the content screen goes blank and the podcast will not play. If, however, I am in WiFi range when I launch a downloaded episode, it will play and continue to play as I leave WiFi range. So I conclude that a data connection is required to launch an episode, even if it has been downloaded."

"798",351707231,"Okay, let me start by saying I enjoy playing this game, but what I don't enjoy is getting a pop-up ad on a game I paid money for.  If you need to charge more for the app up front, I'm cool with that, but I hate ads.  This is the first app I've ever seen that has done that, so - 1 star.  Then, some of the physics seem a bit off sometimes, as in 5mph of wind ought to be the same every time, but it's not, -1 star for that.  Other than that, fun game."

My phone only back tracks to one year therefore that withdrawal was made years ago and I had to log into a computer to back track to that transaction. I understand it’s for my card safety but there should be an option to provide other verification."
"802",351939099,"If you are a fan of text-based RPGs, this would be a great game for you. It could easily become a more text-based game, but the images and artwork make it more engaging and interesting.   There is an easy-to-learn, simple UI and the game progression is satisfying. There are things that could be refined/cleaned up or expanded on as with any game, but it is definitely worth a buy.   I’d be thrilled to see more content (not that there isn’t enough already for a game like this) or a similar game (sequel?).  とってもいいゲームですよ。毎日これをしました！"
"803",351939099,"Played the lite version And seems promising. But buying the full version on iPad now crashes iCloud feature every time. So I can’t use that feature or load from lite. Disappointing.

"806",351986992,"I got the free version of this app I think about 4 years ago when I was outside one evening looking at the sky trying to win a bet with my wife about the Big Dipper and Little Dipper. It doesn’t matter who won the bet!😡 Anyway it was so awesome I purchased the full version right away. Now I use it to find out when their will be meteor showers, comets, satellites or even the International Space Station. I use the reminder function so The family doesn’t miss anything cool. Not only does it remind of events, it shows you where to look for the best chance of seeing meteors, it lists all the stars, constellations and planets. Plus, when viewing comets or satellites or other moving objects it will track them so you just hold up the phone and follow. We love this app, it is super fun, so much so that the kids don’t even know they’re learning. I would recommend this to anyone. The free version is fine but the premium is definitely with the few pennies it cost."
"807",351986992,"So happy with this app, extremely accurate. Told me when the International Space Station would be visible and tracked it across the sky. Very impressed."
"808",352000376,"I have been using this app for years and I absolutely love it. My only problem is that the data doesn’t automatically transfer across my devices, eg. iPhone to iPad or vice versa."

"813",352199775,"I used to love this app, loved it so much I purchased the upgrade in March 2018.  Here it is September 2019, and I cannot get into my upgrade because of “errors” AND I  now have to watch an ad EVERY time I want to log my water...... it is now a terrible app.  So bad I am going to delete it!"

I have photos turned off but background picture takes up as much space.   Where are icons?   App takes along time to load.  I wish I could attach a screenshot but I AM using Netdiary.  When I select breakfast or any meal I get a screen with a list of the meals followed by a + sign, barcode sign and ellipses sign.  There is no swipe to copy.   It is still there for exercise.  Not changing rating.  Green square with green apple in the middle that has a tape measure around the middle....the word Pro at an angle in the upper left corner.... been using it for years.   MyNetDiary.  Seriously dislike the new view for iPad.   If I wanted the wide landscape mode, there is MyNetDiary HD.    So, still not changing rating.  Also,  then why does swipe work for exercises?"
"815",352247139,"I tried about ten similar apps before landing here. Of the ones I tried, FitBit did ok, but as I’m switching to an Apple Watch I don’t really need that app anymore.   This is the one I found that was for sale! Most apps are subscription only or are missing key features. To be fair there are some things in this app restricted to subscribers, but so much is available for the small fee for the Pro app that I’m thrilled. Especially love the bar code scanner."

"822",352670055,"I’ve experienced this app on an iPad a few months back and after an hour of landings was beyond hooked. Honestly I found the iPad an easier tool for successful landings than I am experiencing with my iPhone. I don’t know why and won’t venture a guess but short of sitting next to a simulated crew member during descent and upon stop, opening the door and walking down the ramp to the tarmac with them and waving at the TV Cameras in the distance this is just a blast of game that requires you to pay attention, focus, think, learn new skills and have a blast all at the same time."

"831",353573707,"What's the fun of this if I can't look around ?"
"832",353642901,"do not waste money on this. you’re better off using your internet browser. not because it doesn’t work. but the interface on a browser is 10x better than the app. for example. i did the quiz to name all countries of europe, instead of giving you the map of europe and locating the name of the country when you get it correct, it just gives you a list and that’s it. don’t pay money for this when you can get a better version but just going on the website itself"
"833",353642901,"Waste of a couple bucks. I deleted the app about ten minutes after buying it. I assumed it would be somewhat similar to their web based geography quizzes, but there are no maps. “Name the countries of Europe” or other similar quizzes are literally just you typing out the names off the top of your head on a notepad. Seriously, who designed that crap?"

"844",354974729,"Freeze is annoying since it has to be at least once per hour, probably at least twice that. I had it twice after boss fights and once it did it three times in a row with no activity in between. There is definitely a strong tendency to do it at stores probably 2-1 more than all other causes. Also seems like right hand merchant for items is the worst. Another complaint is that item and beast names are different than in my “official” strategy guide. I love the FF franchise so I play through it. I would be screaming and foaming at the mouth if any other game did this and I did saw warnings in other reviews."
"845",354974729,"This game constantly freezes. Sometimes it’ll go back to the home screen if you get out of the app for a while. However, a few times this hasn’t happened. The only option in this case is to delete the app and download it again. The problem with this is it deletes your save data and there is no cloud saving in this game. I’ve tried playing it twice, but I was unable to complete the game both times due to this bug."
"846",354974729,"Come on guys release a fix for this game already. You can’t keep selling it and not keep up with bug fixes. I have iOS 12.3.1 on and iPad Air 2 and can only play for about 10 minutes and then a random crash. Generally happens after a battle."
"847",355524910,"Always among the favorites I come back to over and over again. Wonderful game, challenging campaign, and highly replayable.  The “best time” is a particularly smart feature as I am always happy to try and break my old record.  Well done, Team17!"
"848",355524910,"Games like this are rare these days, you pay a small fee up front and can play all day everyday without blooming ads.

"871",357577420,"Easy to use, love it!"
"872",357577420,"This app is exactly what I was searching for because it enabled me to upload a custom watermark. Easy to use!"
"873",357577420,"I actually really do like this app. I like that it allows me to have a text and an image watermark. Easy to use. The one thing I don’t like, is that even after you purchase the app, they then create another app with new features and charge you more money to get those features. In their new app you can do videos which would be wonderful. Except I’ve already paid five dollars for this app I’m not going to pay more money to get the same features just the video. If you charge somebody for an app - you update the app you don’t create a whole new app. (In my opinion)"

"877",358055270,"Bye far best prank app"
"878",358055270,"This game overall is a five star game. The pictures are not garbage, and everything is really realistic.

"890",360593530,"As a self taught wanna be programmer abroad (living in Beijing) carrying pounds of notebooks around is too much of a task. This app has awesomely reduced the effort it takes to notate and study the multiple things I’m into.   I don’t have many complaints outside the fact that i’ll try to scroll up and it will rarely be unresponsive. Yet this rarely, rarely happens. This app is great for organizing thoughts and studying"

"898",362949845,"I wouldn't consider this a classic version at all. Why, you might ask? Because it's filled to the brim with stupid in-app purchases. The original game you paid one price and got to enjoy the entire game. Now I pay for it and all sorts of features are locked behind micro-transactions.  Developers like Halfbrick, who once revolutionized mobile gaming. Are now just contributing to the corruption and downfall of modern video games. After all the money we've given you, you should be ashamed. You're despicable, beyond greedy and immensely unethical."

"907",363317633,"I trusted the reviews and I regret nothing. I’ve been searching for weeks to find a decent app to help me design logos for me and my friends YouTube channels and instagram and nothing has come close to being as easy to use as this while at the same time giving you the power to create something that’s all your own. Was especially excited when I went to draw freehand and the app corrected my crappy little squiggles and made them smooth lines, (with option to turn that function off) very user friendly for brand new artist with terrible penmanship!😂"
"908",363317633,"And it keeps getting better!  I’ve been using this app for years (under a different app name for a while) and I continue to easily turn out nice drawings that are more than adequate. Best of all, using the features does not force me into deep memory recall or searching for the feature I need after every update.  When I have had an issue it was always my fault, but later a new version would make the correct way to do it obvious.  For example, I always had a problem understanding the set operations like Union.  Not with the latest version—they simply work obviously.  Now I wonder why I was ever confused.  The only other issue I’ve had has been the shape libraries.  There isn’t really any problem with what is provided, I just want more—like network device shapes.  I create my own, of course, but I never seemed to be able to find one that I needed. Somehow this was fixed.  I just created shapes for casters (fixed, rotating, locking) and there they are just where I need them when I want them.  It wasn’t automagic, it just worked like my brain though it should.  And that is why this program is great.  Unlike other drawing Apps, Graphic works they way I think it is supposed to so I don’t have to learn and remember vast minutiae of app oddities.  I already have to much of that rolling around—like a pin-ball machine in my brain where there are rarely extra points for collisions.  So why can’t we have in-app purchases of shape libraries please, or a set of design rules and a website to share the things?  Not that I am complaining.  I have gotten every design drawing completed that I ever wanted, and without calling my friendly drafting expert!  And in jig time.  Thanks."
"909",363317633,"I been using this app when it was iDraw, now called Graphic. It has been my main go too vector tool with great success. It has continued to improve. They have always been very receptive when recommendations were offered which ultimately resulted in a much improved product. I hope they continue to look for better and more affective updates in the future."

"911",363360636,"Not seeing the ships in the soo locks"
"912",363360636,"This app seems to have blackout locations. I’ve read that you can’t see boats in mobile and I know you can’t see any boats further down the Texas coast than Galveston. It’s important to be able to see vessels down around Corpus Christi all the way down to Brownsville but they aren’t showing up at all like they don’t exist."

"916",363486833,"I decided to give the underdog a chance. Totally paid off. This game is fun. Works flawlessly on the series 4. There's times where I need to kill time and don't have my phone on me. They make you completely empty your pockets before getting in line to ride a coaster at universal Orlando for example. No phone, but I'll still have this fun game on my watch to keep me occupied while standing in line.   As the dev keeps mentioning, use the crown to control the ship. I'm having zero problems, just fun. I think operator error is the reason for low star ratings."
"917",363486833,"People are a bit critical of this game.  For 2 bucks it’s a cool watch game with retro graphics.   Use the Digital Crown instead of finger on screen for quicker control.  Dev seems to make frequent updates so even better."
"918",363486833,"Two versions of the exact same game, one game where you get one life with very little goals and a game that is ok at best. Not worth the price."

BUT THEN THE OTHER SLIDER WITH THE PAINT BRUSH IS “FLOW” And it won’t let you change it that I could find!!!  If there is a way Please let me know,   And the other pain in the... Seat.  Is it won’t let you shut off the eye dropper long press,   At first i set it at 2.0 witch I think is 2 Min. And that worked now at the same time 2.0 it does it in a second, So when drawing a little slow it keeps changing colors on me.....  PLEASE HELP!!!!  If those things were fixed then the app would be like 10 Stars in my opinion."

"930",364017607,"This app is the only app I can use easily to draw, Photoshop, and more! I've been using this app for a very long time, but I have a few suggestions and comments, though. When you look at pictures from other people on the Online Gallery, it would be helpful to add comments so you can ask how you drew something, ask for/add tips, and more. It would also be neat if you could like someone's photo. Also, it would be nice if you added more pictures more often. I recommend this app-- and the money? Totally worth it! Don't hesitate, innocent citizen reading this- buy it! I rate this app 5 stars! Great work!  EDIT: I'm writing this five years later. Cringed at my old review. Anyway, the app keeps crashing and destroying my art!! Glitches and makes it completely trashed. Please please please fix!!"
"931",364165557,"This is one of the best board game adaptations on my iPad. Everything flows smoothly. Access to the information on the races, special powers and other things are a click away while in the game. I can’t recommend this game enough."
"932",364165557,"Family loves the game. It’s very competitive even against computer. Would love to see more updates as I have purchased all the expansions."
"933",364165557,"I never played the actual board game but if you want a polished board game that is entertaining and contains just enough strategy then this is highly recommended.  The amount of sheer combos of and ever present ability to switch combo characters on the fly adds endless possibilities.  Presentation is awesome and user friendly. A great gem of an app.   With the fast forward button, games are a mere 10-15 min and if you exit it's saved.  I picked up Be not Afraid and can't wait to play it.  I have not tried online multiplayer though so I can't speak to that.  But solo games can be with bots or bots + other pass and play people."

Maybe (option of) changing the font of the numbers on the tape can solve this.  Other than that, everything is great, Thanks!  Update: The fixed digit widths on the tape as an option came to Digits! Thanks, you are GREAT!!  (Setting>Font>Monospace Tape Values)  Bug! Why the result of sin(30) is shown as 0.499999999... and not 0.5?!  Why large numbers are truncated in middle?  Suggestion: Option to display fixed decimal if there are fractions, and show as a simple number if there aren’t fractions. (Show 12.3456789 as 12.345 and 12 as 12, not as 12.000)"
"944",364500115,"I’ve used this for several years and it has never let me down. Easy, multi-functional, and has every possible option you need in one app. I was concerned when there was a big ios upgrade that the developers would just give up and drop any future upgrades. No so, got even better. It’s the best $0.99-1.98 you will ever spend on any app. Period!"
"945",364500115,"Nice to get your bills organized and budget your expenses. No need to wait for your excel file to open. Just type your numbers and edit accordingly updating the results automatically. I opted for the export function as well to share the “tape” (output) with my family.  It’d be nice if one could also import CSV files."
"946",364502063,"Recently purchased this app to manage pdf files.  There are zero instructions.  I was unable to view any files on my iPad Pro. Extremely disappointed that I wasted my time, energy and money on this knock off version on Adobe Acrobat.  Lesson learned. Do not purchase this app!"
"947",364502063,"I wish I could crop PDF files and have the pages change by scrolling down or up instead of left or right.   The instructions on how to print were not great.  The icons were too small and the print symbol is minute.  The support pdf is not great.  It did not show the process.    When finished managing a file by changing its name or emailing etc, I have to quit the app in order to get back to reading the PDF files."
"948",364502063,"Purchased app for one purpose: to edit a pdf.  After some difficulty I was able to transfer the pdf from Adobe Acrobat to this app.  Although I can open the pdf, I am unable to do any editing.  Highlighting, scribbling on it - yes, but no editing as was promised in the app description.  2 emails to developer went unanswered.  Disappointed overall.  When I am driving sometime, I’ll call 800-myapple and get my money back."
"949",364738545,"I was delighted to find file browser. This way I could wirelessly transfer items between my ipad and desktop. It is a very reliable app and I use it daily to back up to an external drive. It has to be set up with your router but it works like a charm."
"950",364738545,"I’ve been using it for several years to access my Sinology NAS from my iPad and iPhone.  A great app!"
"951",364738545,"I bought this app hoping it would help with transferring videos and images from my iPhone to my desktop. AirDrop is fine for individual files that you don’t mind having compressed and preview works some of the time so I was looking for a better way to transfer media files. After getting error messages on over 70% of the videos I’ve tried to transfer I was hoping I could cancel my purchase but there is no option to contact customer service for this app via the App Store."
"952",364740856,"I was unable to reload the program after purchasing all of the options since I got a new iPad. I have tried to contact the programmers to no avail. If you happen to need to reload this program you will lose the options that you paid for."
"953",364740856,"Takes forever to load because it’s pulling down ads and other useless bloat like ‘word of the day’.   As a dictionary I was not impressed."
"954",364740856,"One of the things I love about the iPad is the multitasking functionality and the ability to do split screen mode with so many apps, being able to have an app for whatever reference I might be needing sitting alongside my main app. It would be really lovely to have my dictionary (the OG reference tool) just be able to saddle up next to what ever I am reading or writing, with out having to switch screens. Without that, I might as well just make a safari shortcut and keep the website beside what I’m doing. And this one feature on an app “for iPad” is worth losing two stars."
"955",364762290,"For 3 or 4 years now, I’ve been using this app for 2D animation. I really enjoy it and how simple and easy it is to animate unlike some apps. There might be some bugs but other than that I definitely recommend this for others. It helped me grow on my YT Channel too so yeah, thank you DoInk :)"
"956",364762290,"This has been fun to learn and use.  I have a classroom full of kids and some are getting a black box around an element when it is brought into Green Screen.  It can be an element from the app or one drawn by students.  Very frustrating, and cant find an answer!"
"957",364762290,"Hey.. I don’t typically post reviews for apps, but this is a special case.   The app’s animation itself is okay, although the editor is a bit hard to work with and offers no explanation at all.  The concept is as if they took an incredibly easy to use kids app and dipped it into some professional apps in the sense with the tools are a bit hard to figure out and you have to toy with it for a bit to understand them.  I did like the tweening, though.  Overall, this app would be getting a better review if it was free with a pro version or something,   if you’re searching for an animation app try FlipaClip, (don’t mean to advertise, just my personal reference)"

"966",365152940,"I have been using Photo Transfer for several years now. I have found it to work very effectively and permits me to work with my IPhone and at the end of the day download my work flawlessly. I can highly recommend this app. It does what it was designed to do very well."

"976",366247306,"Great game! Are you coming out with Sudoku for the Apple Watch?"
"977",366247306,"I played this game for years but deleted it off my phone after the last update because of the ads. Even with the sound turned off they would play (with sound) after every game.  They also run constantly across the bottom of the screen and if you accidentally hit the bar they pop up with sound. This is especially bad when you’re trying to not bother the people around you! This was a deal-breaker for me and they lost a loyal fan!"
"978",366247306,"It is an average Sudoku game. The only draw back is the way they position the number that you have to pick from.  They overlap each other and if you take your eyes off of them you tend to hit the incorrect number. The numbers need to be spaced apart."
"979",366562751,"I don’t think there is a simpler or more convenient way to buy tickets for any event, whether it be a concert, sporting event, or even a cactus juggling competition. Stubhub is the way to go!!!!"

BUT as a paid member using the Pro version, we get additional options. What happens to them?  Today I was just charged my annual membership for the PRO features. Does that get reimbursed?"
"983",366626332,"Great App. Been using it for years and does everything I need it to."
"984",366626332,"Great app."
"985",366869252,"This app has gotten worse with each update.  What happened to the .75 speed?  Sometimes I need to slow an audio book down if there are accents, but the .5 speed is grotesque"
"986",366869252,"I use this from my local library!"
"987",366869252,"It’s one of my favorite apps I love listening the audiobooks my kids enjoy read the ebooks completely happy for that I give 5 stars"

"990",367003839,"Love this site!"
"991",367242040,"Redownloaded for nostalgia, was not disappointed. I’m extremely surprised that there is still support for this game nearly a decade after release. Buy the extra levels, they are worth every penny. Sad to see that the creator stopped creating though; wish he still did."
"992",367242040,"Yo update the game to be more comfortable while playing on an iPhone XS. I’ve had the app since day one. I suggest maybe making the screen bigger."
"993",367242040,"its alright"
"994",367287593,"That was awesome"
"995",367287593,"I love this so much"
"996",367287593,"I used to love using this app, it was a fun thing to do with the family. We’d sit around and call people we knew using one of the random numbers you could pay for. Now ever since the update this app is not enjoyable anymore. You either have to use your own phone number which is pointless, or use that external app that doesn’t work either. I wish you guys would bring this app back to its former glory. I have 45 tokens in my account that I can’t even use now"
"997",367623543,"Agree, sadly, with several comments about the slowness & need to RE install, restart my device, wait forever (really) before I can select another full episode, and a lot of times I just give up cuz I don’t have time to troubleshoot this app, I have work to do - I rely on being able to see the prime time stuff after the fact, cuz I’m usually not at home when it airs! Why did it work so well a couple months ago....? Getting very discouraged ... does Fox know it’s this bad? I want to give it more stars but can’t, it’s getting worse instead of better."
"998",367623543,"I dont have it. So turn off the‘Fox is now on ROKU’ ad. Thanks"

"1001",367706767,"I’m a Philadelphian who’s working far from home. My collection of EarthCam  “likes” lets me see some familiar sights along Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the Free Library where I spent so many of my teen hours and a few other cities where I’ve worked. I even get down to the “Shore”."
"1002",367706767,"I so enjoy the cams all around the world. A feature that I learned to use a few months ago is to post a message on the sites I go to often. Other cam watcher around the world also post in answer. I have learned how to use google translate to post in French, Dutch, Spanish and leave fun message for my cam buddies. It is like being on vacation and sitting on the hotel balcony people, animal and nature watching. The cams are live except in very bad or freezing weather. See you later, I am off to the Michigan Snowman Cam to see what animal are there now and have a look at the post with pictures to see if the bear showed last night."
"1003",368494609,"So far it works great it’s a pleasant to have something you can use for converting news apps thank you"
"1004",368494609,"Do NOT download this app. It will charge you $3.99 twice a month."
"1005",368494609,"Too many ads and never get the gift card  Make sure you on link you scanned"
"1006",368677368,"Everytime I clicked to confirm my ride request it said error so I kept trying and after like the 10th time it went through but it charged my account for 11 of the same trip... they need to fix there app."
"1007",368677368,"If you use the “short walk” option, you had better know the area, because it does not show your location as you walk and you have a few minutes (including waiting for walk signals) to get to the rendezvous location."

"1011",368948250,"Thanks Web.de"
"1012",369111608,"Pros: Page curl animation. Perfectly works with various cloud drives such as FTP, WebDAV, SMB, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. Nice design of book shelfs (it is same as those in iBooks, though)  Cons: Confusing layout or option menu. There are still Japanese only menu or features that may be not good to English users’ experience. It might be better if there are any manuals or explanations about them in English."
"1013",369111608,"faster and soother than many others apps like goodreader. I hope to make ( copy ) option in the front beside ( search, bookmark, more..., google, define, and tweet) it is more important and i need to use many frequent."

"1016",369266386,"Living in the Florida Keys, having Hurricane Tracker is a must. The information is always up to date, and most importantly, reliable. You can listen to the audio report, and watch the graphic reports, so that you are always well informed. The amount of information, and the regularity of updated information is so appreciated. Thank you!"
"1017",369266386,"I have used this app for years but this year noticed that the spaghetti models only include the USA and Canadian models.  The European model that is always so highly rated for accuracy is not shown anymore.  I would certainly rate this higher if it was.  I have had to use a search engine to find information on their predictions."
"1018",369692259,"J’adoreee ❤️❤️❤️"
"1019",369692259,"Cette app est la meilleure."
"1020",369692259,"Why is this app in the US store if it can’t be used/ wont work in the US? Aucun sense!"
"1021",369820957,"Mistakenly thought this converted voice to notes with the original voice kept with it.  That’s not the case.  For what it does do, I think it’s over priced and I wish I could take my purchase back.  Wasted money."
"1022",369820957,"I record songs all the time."
"1023",369820957,"Bug-filled and no update for over a year. Awful."
"1024",369838631,"I love the app. So I’m definitely not here to smear it. But there is an irritating bug in the breath rate. Several times I have it set to 5.4 bpm or 5.5 bpm with no adjusted start breathing rate applied. This is my harmonic rhythm, but I was finding it very hard to keep up. So, I measured it with a chronometers. Even though it is still set at 5.4 bpm the actual rate is 3 bpm.  This happens on the watch app as well.  I am hoping the developers read this an offer a solution. As soon as they do, its back to 5 stars."
"1025",369838631,"A well-designed, well executed app which performs its function beautifully. it really helps me unplug at the end of the day."
"1026",369838631,"The App is very customizable. While maintaining an extremely easy to navigate user interface.  Thanks for a great app. I use it, I like it and it deserves 5 stars."
"1027",369849199,"Nic game"
"1028",369849199,"An App worth purchasing. Seeing that many “ladies” today are phony and only want materialistic B.S. the app is how a girlfriend should be like ."
"1029",369849199,"I LOVE this game. It’s really fun. O think it could have a few changes though. Like a verbal response to what ever the  girl says and for there to be more options (other than four options or using real money) to get in game money"
"1030",369970819,"The screen remains a catatonic gray due to this, completely and utterly useless."
"1031",369970819,"All I get is a blank gray screen. What a waste of my time! Wouldn't even give it one star if I didn't have to in order to post a review!"
"1032",369970819,"I like it"

You can enable access in privacy settings’  However, going to privacy settings only allows me to see the apps that have already requested and been granted access, not the option to add new apps. I also went to captio’s settings but the option isn’t there either. Otherwise loving the app, but help!"
"1038",370899391,"Have used it for years and it still works fine, but hasn’t been updated in 3 years so it looks bad on the iPhone X series phones."
"1039",372283316,"I really enjoy this game immensely. But I have stalled out in the 70k range, my highest score is 81k.  I think there is an issue with the algorithm, as even if I get lower completion times my scores stay in the 70k range. Suggestion: I'm not interested in my number of runs- I'm interested in score vs. time and keystroke."
"1040",372283316,"I love this app and can while away some serious time in it!😘"
"1041",372283316,"It was only $3 for the game, so no big deal, but the game is poorly thought out.  If a number isn’t used on the opening screen, it is impossible to highlight those numbers that you entered as pencil marks.  You should be able to highlight a pencil mark number and then place it on the screen in multiple places just by touching squares.  Instead you need to highlight a square first and then touch a pencil mark number.  You have to repeat this over and over."
"1042",372513032,"Make it so we can earn free coins/gifts to give"
"1043",372513032,"Excellent"
"1044",372513032,"A great app now"
"1045",372648912,"I’ve had the app for a few weeks and so far I love it. It’s there when you need it and people can see you for about an hour after you close it. The only thing I ask you fix is the friend request quick message. I thought my phone froze and ended up saying thanks for the add about 7 times before the window closed. Thanks"
"1046",372648912,"I’ve had my account for a few weeks now. But it keeps randomly logging out. And when I don’t remember my password. I try to get the email to reset it. It never sends one. Then wants me to put in my old password to secure my account. Like if I knew my password then I wouldn’t be in this circle. Tired of making new accounts for no reason."
"1047",372648912,"I never write reviews,but I’m honestly really annoyed with meetme. I have been using this app since the very beginning when it was My Yearbook. I’ve loved it for many many years. But now it’s based mostly on streaming and how much money people make from it...I had gotten. Used to that,and had suggested my friend make an account. I lended her my phone to do so,and she received a screen prompt requesting she verify her account. She attempted to add her personal phone number that she has through a provider,but was told it was invalid. Then,I attempted to add my number and got the same issue. Now,I’ve been unable to access my account for about 2 months & unable to get in even after redownloading the app. EXTREMELY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED. I’m all for more security but fix the flaws!"
"1048",373203236,"I’ve had this app on two iPhones and both times it glitches upon closing. I LOVE this app, but cannot stand the fact I have to completely shut down my iPhone after using it."
"1049",373203236,"This was very useful in studying however when you pause the game after tapping the location the application will act like you haven’t tapped making you retap and wasting time which in turn wastes points. Please fix this"
"1050",373203236,"I really love this app, but can you please add more challenging and diverse questions because the questions keep reappearing."
"1051",373236724,"I use it for audiobooks mainly and find it works well, especially if the book is chapterized.  If not and you lose your place, the controls make it a bit hard to get back to the exact point.  Otherwise I am quite pleased"
"1052",373236724,"I mostly like this one and use it for guitar practice. Looping sections of songs or videos to play repeatedly, plus the ability to slow down the speed, are great features. Minus a star because neither of these features is implemented in the friendliest manner. But right now it’s my go to player and haven’t found one better!"
"1053",373236724,"I have used this app for many years. It not only keeps updating but also become even better."
"1054",373311252,"What a life saver.  Instead of paying someone crazy $$$ and waiting hours BAM do it myself instantly!  Love this app"
"1055",373311252,"Bought this app to remove unwanted emojis from pictures and all it does it distort the area where the emoji was. If you’re plan is to buy this app to remove emoji’s, don’t waste your money. Don’t be mislead by other reviews. This app removes emojis and leaves a smudge behind. If I could refund this app, I would, but there isn’t an option for that."
"1056",373311252,"I take a lot of pictures and have a lot of photography apps. This is probably my most-used app. It can’t remove everything but it does a really good job of removing objects and people from photos (particularly when the background is uniform or similar). I’ve removed so many stray things in photos using this app. It’s fantastic."

"1060",373493387,"This app is not good at free version on Android. Lack of replay audio button when I show the answer. You should have shortcut wipe gesture instead of just button. Moreover, it should scale the picture fit with the screen rather than zoom in too big. They will interrupt the learning process"
"1061",373493387,"Hold off on the iOS 13 update. The UI flashes and stutters when viewing cards with photos. A handful of bugs need to get worked out to bring this back up to its typical quality level."
"1062",373493387,"first off, anki is amazing. i’m very grateful that there’s a mobile app. however, i really wish that add-ons from the desktop application would be applicable to the mobile application. my biggest complaint, though, is that before, night mode could be turned on/off specifically in the app. but now, i can only change the appearance of the app by changing the settings for my ENTIRE device. meaning if i want to have the appearance of the anki app be all black aka “night mode” i need to make EVERYTHING on my device have the night mode appearance. to be frank, i think that is the absolute dumbest thing ever. they need to change it back to how it was before."

"1072",373903654,"Although I enjoy the content of Wired magazine, I would NOT recommend subscribing digitally through this app.  Once you subscribe, you will receive an incessant stream of spam from Condé Nast that will continue despite all your attempts to unsubscribe and mark as junk mail.  It’s been such a pain that I’ve canceled my subscription."
"1073",373903654,"And background?"
"1074",373903654,"Since moving to the iPad several years ago as my primary reading device, there are certain standards that I have come to expect with my digital publications.   The number one requirement is that the content supports both portrait and landscape modes, not just portrait mode, as WIRED still only does. I and most people I encounter who use an iPad use some form of case and/or keyboard cover that puts the device into landscape mode for TIME magazine used to offer both modes, but then they went portrait-only and I found it totally frustrating and dropped the subscription.  There are several other digital publications that don’t suffer from this problem (I’ve used the ZINIO reader for a few things), so this is not a difficult problem to solve.  Other reviewers have commented on the lack of zoom and other viewing controls and I agree with their concerns.  Finally, the new “Swipe down” control isn’t as easy as the prior control.  If you’re not careful, you’ll swipe down from the top and reveal an iPad control, not the WIRED app control to get back to the menu and settings.  This is not as intuitive and it doesn’t work as well.  I’d just assume see the older control where you tapped on the content to reveal the menu bar at the top.  Please listen to your customers while you have them and make these changes.  These are much more fundamental things and make more of a difference than animated cover pages and other bells and whistles."
"1075",374151636,"This app ended up completely useless. The only export options give you low-res jpg/ pdf files that are unreadable. I was going to use it to help outline a novel and hoped to export as a jpg that I could then import into Scrivener. But since the text is completely blurred, that's not possible. Utter garbage."
"1076",374151636,"I downloaded the App because the online version kept timing out.  I get all my info plugged in and the App version does the same thing.  I can’t even get back in to see if the information is still there.  My internet connection is strong.  How can I complete the project if the App won’t even work properly."

"1085",374791544,"I love this game and I haven’t been able to download it because the developer needs to update it to work on IOS 11.  [adult swim] fix this pleaseeeeeee!!!"
"1086",374791544,"UPDATE THIS APP PLEASE"
"1087",375239755,"antes tú podías hablar de cualquier cosa gratuitamente, ahora tienes que pagar una membresía para que sea lo que era antes y eso me parece muy estúpido . Obviamente nadie va a pagar por eso"

"1090",375295479,"I always loved playing it IRL, and the app is simply amazing. I have a ton of expansion packs, and they’re all great. The only one that I wish they would add is under the big top.😀"
"1091",375295479,"My family and I can’t get enough of this game! We love the many expansions that have been added already and are hoping for even more eventually!  This is, hands down, one of the best online multiplayer games for iOS, and perfect for turn-by-turn players who want to take their time. I use this game as a way to connect with my family overseas, as well as have fun with my wife when we are apart.   Please bring us more expansions! We’ll gladly buy them! :)"
"1092",375295479,"First, this is one the the absolute best ports from a board game to digital that exists.   One suggestion to make gameplay better:  when in the dragon phase and the dragon only has one possible legal move, it would really help move the game along if the system just made the moves automatically. The dragon already adds a lot of time to Internet games. This would make the experience much better and seamless."
"1093",375380948,"Total scam"
"1094",375380948,"Inexplicably, this app doesn’t support FaceID (as of 9/2019). While I have no problem using TouchID on my iPad Pro to check the status of orders, on my iPhone XS Max I need to key in my Apple password.  I made a call to tech support to see if it was just my install and after researching, the tech said it was expected behavior.  Seems like an oversight that hasn’t been addressed (for too long now). Other than that, a decent app for browsing and ordering Apple gear."

"1102",376202925,"This app is a pain to use. The sign-in is annoying and should be replaced by fingerprint ID. They push their services, whatever they want to sell you today, which makes it difficult to get to the basics, like your balance and account activity. They alert you to messages that are really just more ads and there is no way to opt out. It is hard to navigate. It often crashes and is often inexplicably « unavailable. » I like this bank in spite of this app, not even partly because of it."
"1103",376202925,"There is a delay with updating my balance.  The information for my assigned banker was not working. It's a great concept to be provided with a name and number of someone who will advise me. Please fix this.  Thanks   If these things could be fixed, I'd give it a 5 star."
"1104",376202925,"After using this for a year with two CA accounts I can say it is extremely troublesome and often has problems where you can’t sign in or refresh your account. Very bothersome."
"1105",376374689,"This game was so much fun"
"1106",376374689,"The game is okay. The only thing I wish was changed is the option to stop visiting the earth every time you create something. It gets old really quickly."
"1107",376374689,"I remember playing this game years ago and really enjoyed it. Downloaded this game and expected the same fun game but all I get is a black screen. Deleted the app and downloaded it again with the same results. This was an extremely fun app that unfortunately doesn’t seem to function anymore."
"1108",376412660,"I paid for the Pro Version Bundle but the Ads don’t go away which is very annoying! The main reason for paid for apps is be able to play freely and interrupt. Please fix this ASAP."
"1109",376412660,"A simple game that I play when I'm bored. I mainly play it on PC, but I play it on my IPad sometimes."
"1110",376412660,"I have played this game for a long time and have always enjoyed it. The mini game is fun and challenging, but the pet peeve of mine in this game is that the shotgun is clearly not what it’s supposed to be. It doesn’t have spread damage like any shotgun would do, I would really like this to actually feel like the gun is real.  Overall the guns are still great and the visuals and character/map design are breathtaking for a mobile game like this  I know carnivores is not known for its water stuff, but a sea themed carnivores game is interesting, like maybe megalodons, mosasaurs, dunkelosteus,"

"1112",376436174,"It's a decent app, but I don't know why it's costs money. I like that it focuses on the conference I usually care about, but there are some pretty crucial features missing. Why no play by play? It doesn't even show you who has possession of the ball. I like the radio feature but also could show you options to stream video. Am I missing something? Has a lot of potential but needs work"

"1116",376510438,"Ok, we KNOW that older iPads can handle Hulu playback...same with Netflix. So why are  iOS devices that don't have ios11 at minimum at this time; Sept2019, simply unable to have these apps for these services?! Aka: they require minimum ios11. Question; why? Do not feed me BS as I have been compiling iOS apps since 2012. Either Apple is paying them off or their development teams are bottom of the barrel.  #KeepingItReal"

Instead of just learning the language by roman alphabet, I thought it would serve them better to start with hiragana...  The rest is history!  In less than one hour both were writing hiragana and memorizing it and loving this app!!  I'm so excited because they are learning it so quickly AND enjoying it at the same time.... :). Next, katakana. ;)"
"1118",376561911,"My 4 year old son loves this. He has lots of fun exploring what each character picture does."
"1119",376561911,"Good app.  I would like English letters listed for the sounds because they are hard to decipher when listening to a child say them.  To a second language learner, the sounds sound the same.  Also romanji spelling on the pictures would be nice."
"1120",377342622,"Worst application and not worth at all and a waste of time"
"1121",377342622,"This app works okay.  For some reason it constantly loses track of where it is in space and drifts the panorama slightly no matter how well you hold the camera in its location.  The bigger issue is trying to get photos loaded to Twitter or Facebook.  I’ve yet to be able to do it because the upload always fails immediately.  I’ve tried to contact the developer to no avail.  Also if you go about it in the longer way by saving it to your Photos on your phone then trying to upload it to Facebook, it still doesn’t work.  The app messes up the EXIF data so Facebook doesn’t recognize it as a 360 photo.  Basically you can take cool 360 panoramas but can’t do anything with them..."
"1122",377342622,"This app would be cool if it didn’t lose track of where the pano was in physical space.  For some reason it drifts ever so slightly, causing tearing.  The only solution is to move the phone, but introduce parallax, which is not really a good solution.  Not sure why it doesn’t align based off of the accelerometer AND camera feed.  Just take what the camera sees when it’s on an already photographed part of the grid and double check occasionally.  I find even using the technique I use for shooting manually-stitched panoramas do not work with this for a full sphere.  It’s not useless for hemispheres, though.  Never had accelerometer issues with this phone: it’s fairly new, and the few AR apps I’ve run work very well with no graphics drift."
"1123",377677727,"I like this app! It is very convenient to use. I always check the mega million numbers every few days."
"1124",377677727,"I would rate 5 stars if it had a scanner. It does have the numbers so I manage. Still add a scanner."

"1126",377704407,"Great game, decent graphics, fun idea. But, there could be more realistic recipe selections and more realistic ingredients. And, maybe you could have a choice to make frosting the frosting... and I know what you’re thinking, “why is this 11 year old kid ranting about graphics and realistic choices?”. And, the reason why, is because I want my games to be a good quality. Thank you for your time, and God bless you."
"1127",377704407,"Great   Game   I love shoe the goose games.To chose frosting,flavor,and toppings is really fun.To shape cakes and frost them is my favorite part.I also like to make my own colored frosting.

"1131",377908737,"The app is somewhat useful but has a few bugs. If you turn the phone sideways you lose the dashboard including speed. We were boating in the Adirondacks last week and it couldn't provide routes between the various lakes even though they were navigable. Worst of all email customer service stinks. First time no response to my questions for a week so I emailed agsin. Got an apology and was asked for a screen shot which I sent immediately. That was a week ago and I've heard nothing despite a 3rd email I sent a few days ago.   * updated after developer responded. I still have no resolution to the routing issue and no further responses from horrendous tech support. Also the dashboard could be placed on one side of the screen so you don't lose a lot of map space."

When I opened it up on my iPad this issue reoccurred and only when I opened it on my computer did it show in the correct format. Up until the. It was very helpful though."
"1136",378352300,"The app itself is very user friendly and useful, my only issue is, if you’re trying to load profiles, it always appears as an error, also some posts I get notifications for, but when I go on the app they’re gone, and they were all questions about something with school, or something helpful for everyone else, so there was no reason for the messages to just be deleted or disappear."

No adult language either. All you’re doing is helping an adorable blue cat eat sushi and win the heart of the girl he loves.  One downside is that the game is short, so it won’t last long if you’re a dedicated gamer. However, Sushi Cat 2 is in the works. I’m looking forward to that."

You’ve done a great job with minding its operation, and add updates as often as anything of any kind I’ve seen.  By the way to those reading this; imo, it is well worth the couple of dollars (one. time payment) to upgrade to the Pro. A lot more for very little.

In just 2 or so weeks of obsessively playing it, I knew so much more about the states than I did before and had collected over 120 states! I do wish that the updates were placed on the same app, because I wouldn’t pay anything for the second version now that I know quite a bit about the states, but still like the new elevation maps and mini games the second version provides. Also, I wish that you could transfer the app between two devices. I got stack the countries on my Samsung Galaxy S9 phone and want to transfer it to my iPad without having to buy it again. I also got pretty far in the app (received over 120 countries) and don’t want to start over. Thank you for reading this review, I really love the app!"

I went from 10,000th to place up to 3000th and then back to 10,000th, all while correcting my bearing in sales, if needed, throughout the day.

I’ve only been playing for about two hours now but it’s fairly simple to use and it’s fun. I stole the wind from my nearest competitor and expect to finish in the top 10,000. If you know how to sail this is a game for you, and if you don’t know how you’ll gain a bit of the sailing experience. It’s been said sailing is ninety-nine percent boredom followed by one percent of shear and utter panic. This app keeps you safe and dry, with racing others adding more excitement.  It’s been a about a week now and I can honestly say that in my opinion this is the best game for your phone pad or tablet.  I started off a little shaky being to hard on the tiller but I have improved somewhat and now the only complaint I have would be is with the sail configuration. When on a port tack whether beating reaching or running the headsails remain fixed on starboard, this is purely aesthetic and doesn’t make a hill of beans difference in playability, it just looks weird."

And Due is still the best money I ever spent in the App Store. I will buy all major version updates just to keep this awesome developer in business! Regular free updates too (like Siri support), and steady bug squashing. New interactive notification snoozing is awesome too. This app offers a real difference and improvement over Apple’s Reminders. Due is the procrastinator’s best friend, and the cure-all for my stress- and age-induced ADD. Been using it since about a month after I got my first iPhone in 2010, and it will never leave my phone dock.

I would have given this game 5 stars which in my view it deserves but given the fact that the cards disappear in cities and nights practically every game I can only give 3 stars.   Massively frustrating to force quit the game during an exciting challenge only to find myself being kicked out by other players since I did not re-enter fast enough (it takes a while to load).  No update in one year leaves me to believe that USM’s focus lies elsewhere.  Very very frustrating issues but it remains a great game!"

"1330",391297152,"I have owned this game for many years it. I play several games a day and have purchased a number of add ons. The artist lost their way for a while but a recent update has thrown away the insipid tiles of the past 2 years and moved closer to the original releases which were top notch. I hope they eventually allow the option to select both the tile sets used and the game board as the original was simply inspired. The current set is quite good but the earliest board and tile set gives the game a great apocalyptic mad max feel that the later 2 iterations have not quite captured. The Ai us sometimes a bit stupid. Looks like it was never tweaked to correct issues. Eg the Sharrash Ai almost never uses one of its best pieces, “the hole”  which is a must use pice whenever I am playing that race. Another issue is that sometimes the Ai draws 2 fight tiles and an attacker, and instead of putting the attacker down it will discard it and use one of the attack initiations when the obvious thing to do would be to deploy an attacker and then initiate combat. Or maybe it draws 2 attacks and a movement tile and it won’t use the movement to avoid getting smashed in the attack its about to initiate. Other things it does is certain races have a race they are hard wired to attack, even though it would be far wiser to attack another race so it can win. Really bizarre really."
"1331",391297152,"This is a terrible game boring slow and dumb"
"1332",391297152,"When I picked up this game I didn’t think I would like it. I can confidently say a week later that it may have been the best five bucks I’ve ever spent. I think one thing that could make this game better is more free to play factions."
"1333",391304000,"This is my first ever App Store review, and its for this app. This app is my go to navigation app, along with google maps. I’ve tried tens of other apps, and none beats the value or functionality this app. For a one time $4 fee, I’ve got everything.   Features I found really useful/invaluable- 1- offline nav. There are other apps that also offers this, but the value isn’t there. They either ask for a subscription, or their maps aren’t as detailed or as useful. 2- choice of maps. In the states I like usgs topo, or topo map 1 or 2. Elsewhere, topo map 1 seems to be my go to- it has a lot of bike lanes mapped out around urban areas, and the terrain features are succinct. 3- route building. There are a few routing services (mapquest, graphhopper, yours) that you can play around with, and generally they are on point. They have a good balance between directness, best route for your method of going (biking, car, hiking, etc), and common sense (not trying to go above be the highest mountain even if it’s the most direct) 4- search. Search feature/point of interests surprisingly will show up even the most obscure place in remote areas 5- various app settings. All super useful - you can manually reduce gps accuracy, change overlay settings to make things easier to read, all super useful when I’m looking for a no frills app that will make efficient use of my precious iPhone battery. Other apps look and seem clunky that will take up tons of battery, all for a nice shiny look, but with crap functionality 6- recording. You can record and export your gpx file, super useful for journaling and keeping track.   All in all, I keep coming back to this app. Other apps seem seductive, but this app does it all and it does it with no fuss, all bang. You guys rock!"
"1334",391304000,"This app seems to lag sometimes and has difficulty loading maps in mountainous areas. I tried loading maps while on forest service roads, where I had cell signal, and the maps would freeze and not load as I zoomed in to look for roads and plan a route. I have purchased the full app, so I’m disappointed so far. I’ll continue to use it and hopefully have more success. This should work fine without cell reception anyway, seeing as how it is based on GPS for location, versus cell reception and data."
"1335",391304000,"I have been using this app for about two years now, and it has proven itself useful time and time again. The GPS is surprisingly accurate, and the terrain models show a sufficient amount of detail. The ability to save offline chunks and plot and track routes is what makes this app awesome. It has saved me many times when the trail disappears under snow or I decide to take a ‘shortcut’ or excursion and lose the trail. It helped me through a 5-day trip in the Sierra range, as well as more day hikes than I can count. It also has proved useful for plotting overland 4x4 trips. Can definitely recommend. Only problem is the step-up structured payment system... it would be nice to just have one Pro version that gives full access to whatever the app can offer.  tl;dr: This app is accurate, helpful, and awesome. Only drawback is the payment structure. Recommend for any outdoor enthusiast."
"1336",391432693,"So now I don’t even get to decide which orientation my canvas is at?  Move the iPad and phoomp like magic, it’s back to some idiots predetermined setting?  Why?  What’s the point?  How hard is it to simply let the artist, let the designer, simply determine their own needs?  But no, instead let’s just keep dumbing it down for the masses, for the “home user”, remove tools that were useful, make it easier for a generation of Snapchat idiots.  Well done...  Rage is simply more dying garbage in the toxic ecosystem that is iOS and Apple.    There’s just no real useful, decent software out there, and what is will like be turned into a subscription service designed to rob the user of Choice, freedom, and their money.  Works for adobe and their robbery so might as well.  Good job ArtRage team, you’re just part of a collective fail."
"1337",391432693,"If anyone had every told me you could paint using an ipad  (Pro) just like you could on a canvas I would not believe it. But, this app comes so close - unbelievable how well you can paint using this app. Great job guys!!!"
"1338",391432693,"I love Procreate but it seems to be missing a realistic paint blending simulation. I heard Art Rage would be able to simulate real paint but unfortunately, like Procreate, the iOS version of Art Rage produces a dull gray purple-ish color when mixing blue and yellow. I blame myself for not doing the proper research before buying. Maybe an update will add this feature."

The rocket that is supposed to launch sometimes fails to do so. In addition, it focuses mainly on factual information as opposed to mathematical skills. Young students might simply click on as many stars as possible as opposed to clicking on the right stars since there is no consequence for wrong answers. This way, they are not learning, they are just playing. I would not recommend it for teachers for classroom use. I would not recommend it otherwise because it is spotty and doesn’t always work."
"1382",393989284,"I see the awesome potential in this, and reading the reviews from many years ago it looks awesome.  But what happened?  Did they stop supporting it?  There are no math problems when you launch the rocket, it just goes up and then crashes.  ??!!  Please respond."

When you start the app it will give you a diet assessment of everything you have ate in 48 hours i believe and it tells you everything! Carbs, fats, proteins, exercise, sleep anything you can think of. Its the only fitness app i use a-lot. I used to be 180 pounds now I'm 178 and my goal is to lose 35 pounds.

Now RC Solutions thought it is better to pay a monthly fee for the ""premium"" version which does the same as my previous paid add-ons. There is even ""High Speed Delivery"".  The only problem is that now the notification come slow or later than before. If you say it is a ""Premium"" subscription service then make sure your ""Premium"" services are working correctly.

Update 5/13:  While I appreciate the three or so updates over the past month (having gone without any updates for more than 3 years), the artificial intelligence (or ""computer"") opponent, when playing on the hardest setting, is permitted an unlimited number of back-and-forth moves in the same two spaces; whereas than the human player is afforded apx. two.  How can the Developer justify this? The computer and the human players must be able to play by the same rules, and on a level playing field, or the game will continue to periodically receive a decreased rating from me."

I love doing campaigns on here they’re really fun like “napoleon’s waterloo” or “the fall of baron” and my thing is there are only 2 i think there should be atleast 4! And when i want to redo the campaign i push next and it doesn’t even give me the next battle! #3. Again about campaigns I don’t like how they criticize you after you did your best to win! Especially in “napoleon’s waterloo” napoleon criticizes you like CRAZY becase you try your best to win and then you lose then he pops up and says “my plan was flawless you just didn’t execute it properly” or something really annoying. so i’d like for you to consider these changes and please fix atleast 1 or 2 of them  Thank you."

I had to go through all the hoops for the number including giving them an email address, and then I received the notice that I was successful. However, upon sending or trying to receive a message, no success. I would get messages saying that the number had not been activated. Worse yet, upon going into settings, the number would change from the original one given. But if I tried to activate the new number, I would get a message saying that I already had set up a number with the email address given.

"1513",402614251,"Probably the BEST .99 cent I ever spent.. Please find a way to video tape what you are seeing if at all possible.. If you are able to do that, I would pay $5 dollars for it.. A VERY COOL AND FUN WAY to have a few laughs and relieve some tensions"
"1514",402614251,"I got this app when I had my 4s, and I still have it with my 6! Very fun way to enjoy a few minutes of your day."
"1515",402614251,"This app is awesome. It needs more missiles though!!!! Please update."
"1516",403037266,"Should be renamed to “After The Fact” app or “You’re Already Dead” app"
"1517",403037266,"Truly excellent. Love the feature that allows your to see the fault line involved in a quake. This app is superior to others, hands down."

"1519",403090531,"Please update this game! I miss it so much and it can no longer be played!"
"1520",403090531,"Please please give this to GameClub to update so that I can play again. 🙏"
"1521",403090531,"Alex!! I went back 7+ years to find this awesome app I had played on one of my first iPhones. Now I can’t download it because it’s not updated for iOS 11. This game is amazing. Please update if you happen to see this!"
"1522",403684733,"Good app"
"1523",403684733,"Thanks  This app is very great"
"1524",403684733,"Yessss"
"1525",403858572,"Title"
"1526",403858572,"Ima give it a one bc it’s a fun kid game I’d play it all night if I have to no more than bc my brothers think there ninjas it’s sooo annoying also the fact the all boys are annoying you guessed it I’m a girl it’s a terrible app in my appinion"
"1527",403858572,"This latest iteration of Fruit Ninja is a complete shadow of its former self in my opinion. It's one that is totally corrupted by micro-transactions by all accounts.  When I first bought Fruit Ninja on my Android devices and then now Apple devices, forever ago, the game was brilliant in my opinion. But, over the years this once great title has just gotten worse and worse with the inclusion of myriad in-app purchases, advertisements and ultimately - developer greed.  I think it would be so cool if, Halfbrick, offered a classic version of Fruit Ninja as a one time purchase, with no vile advertisements for other Halfbrick games or otherwise and absolutely no in-app purchases. Sadly, because of the aforementioned greed I just really don't see that lovely idea ever happening.   You'd think that after all the money this developer has made from Fruit Ninja and its other titles, that they would be cool enough to offer a classic version of this game. Like I said, though, I don't ever see that happening with Halfbrick truly being lost to greed.  That fact is very unfortunate in my opinion because this used to be one of the best video games available on mobile devices and elsewhere I always thought. Heck, I even bought a copy of Fruit Ninja for my Xbox 360 back in the day to play it using Kinect. And let me tell you, that was an awesome way to play this game, using your arms like swords to slash fruit and rack up crazy combos. I found as well that it was a really good physical workout.   So, I have no aversion to spending my hard earned money on quality video games offered by ethical and moral developers/studios. But Fruit Ninja and Halfbrick are so far removed from being ethical and moral now. That, honestly,  I refuse to spend even the lint in my pocket on the corrupted trash this once great title has truly become."

"1530",404095058,"I personally love this game and a friend of mine had a great suggestion for the game. What if you got coins for completing levels and other thing and you could use them to buy new skateboards. Please add that in!"

"1532",404299862,"I was on WW when they went to free style I stopped losing weight. Switched to this app and love it."

"1535",404405151,"It won’t work. I have been trying to fix the game for centuries, but it has no hope"

"1543",404593641,"Your Apple TV app is TOTAL GARBAGE! There is no activation code to log in. I’ve tried reinstalling the app to no avail. My kids used to love your shows but they don’t even watch it at all anymore because they are so frustrated."
"1544",404593641,"I can’t even log in it won’t let me and there are not complete seasons"
"1545",404593641,"As the title states, the app is horrendous. Trying to find the correct episode takes way too long, and when I click on a specific video another will start playing. This is not user friendly whatsoever. On top of that, the app crashes multiple times, it’s almost as though you have to take your absolute time to find the correct video and you have to be absolutely sure it is the correct episode. I am dissatisfied with this app. Nonetheless I’ll still have to use it if I want to watch some of my favorite shows being that I’m constantly away from home. Cartoon Network it is imperative you fix your app so that it’s more easily accessible and user friendly."
"1546",404990064,"One day went to check out the morning sky an see the ISS  flyover.  This app didn’t or couldn’t pick it up.  It has in the past.  Disappointing"
"1547",404990064,"Maps will no load I cannot see anything. My sky view lite wouldn’t show me the full moon or where it was on a cloudy night. I realize the app is not working now after I purchased the full version I found out neither of them work at all! Please fix this issue I used to love the SkyView."

"1551",405338085,"Who in their right mind would pay 20 per month for a commercial filled app.  I tried this.  I click the 10 second less (literally 10 second clip) and it started playing a 30 second commercial.  I closed that and clicked the next item - commercial.  Are you KIDDING ME!?  I could not undo my purchase fast enough.  It’s a cheap scam by those companies who put out click bait and deliver ZERO.    DO NOT WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE"

"1563",406239138,"Last Update 2 yrs ago.  You can tell."
"1564",406541444,"Love the app!!! Only thing is sometimes it won’t let me upload videos from my album and the app just shuts down when I try to, so not sure why I can’t upload videos. But everything else is great"
"1565",406541444,"This app is great for taking videos... if you’re using the actual app to take them. My app has glitched many times and will not allow me to upload a previously taken video. Every time I try to do so, the app crashes and exits out.  PLEASE FIX THIS. there is no support to find out how to fix this issue either. #unhappy"
"1566",406541444,"Love the app, unfortunately it crashes every time I try to import a video from the camera roll"
"1567",406719683,"Sign In with Apple is not available on iOS 13 in iPhone xR.  Rest of the features works fine."
"1568",406719683,"Used to be great but now there’s so much bloat and ads and worst of all, doesn’t always show all stations. To check for yourself, filter stations so not as many show up then zoom in and out of the map. You’ll see some stations only show up when zoomed close in, once you zoom out they will disappear from both map and list view. Of course the giant iHop ad icon stays no matter what zoom level it’s on."
"1569",406719683,"I am happy"
"1570",407375789,"Waste of money. Doesn’t print labels on iPhone."
"1571",407375789,"Started using this app at Christmas & loved how easy it was to address/send out cards plus they looked very well done!    Also, the developer Nigel will get back with you asap over any issues & have it fixed in a snap!"
"1572",407375789,"I was really tired of trying to keep a labeling list up to date every year. Nothing I used would do everything I needed until AddressLabels came along. Now, if I update the list, I get the new labels to print accordingly. Also, the sheets are already formatted for my label stock, so no more printing test sheets on plain paper to check alignment, etc."

"1580",407838198,"It’s an awesome game, but here’s a few things. Russia needs to be bigger because as someone else said, it’s smaller that any of the bigger countries. The world map for Europe is weird. Russia is not as good quality as the rest, and Albania is tilted. Liechtenstein is a bit off. Asia is weird, too. Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan are squished together. Also, new countries (and maybe territories, too) would be good.. Like Kosovo, Greenland, Western Sahara, and more. Also, when I zoom in on the West Indies, it shows nothing, so I can’t learn about it. Please fix the zoom in screens. They’re broken."
"1581",407838198,"The app is great, but my 5 year old likes to play it and I have to sit and read him every single question, since he can’t read yet! Would love it if a narrator read questions and answer possibilities— then even the youngest of players could benefit and learn!"

"1585",407949800,"After downloading the latest IOS, the game is tiny on my screen"
"1586",407949800,"A fantastic port of the original SNES classic.  Updated graphics are crisper but not too different from the original’s.  Controls work ok, with buttons to tap on-screen for character control and menus, but may be tricky for those with thick hands and smaller devices.  Also includes a very nifty addition of allowing one to quick save 2 spells for fast casting."
"1587",407949800,"Can't say anything bad about the game as I love it and it's awesome however id love of they updated it for the iPhone x. Please and Thank you"
"1588",407976815,"so i updated to ios 12.4 and the PiP mode doesn’t work anymore, the icon changes but the screen doesn't pop out.  FTP crashes each time you send one file making it a hassle when sending multiple files from another device"

"1599",409128287,"Love the articles. App is ok except I really dislike how the Save Later feature is activated. Very often I accidentally activate it when I’m scrolling a bit took slowly or have my finger too long on an article as I skim through the screen. Remove that activation."
"1600",409157308,"I paid for this app to easily get recipes for my baby. But I couldn’t even log in or register. Waste of my time and MONEY!"
"1601",409157308,"Recipies seem nice. It is not very handy to add one by to the meal planner, specially since there is no way to have a general overview of it. You need to remember what you already add and when. Then, once you succeed, there is not shopping list automatic generation, you need to add the recipes again! It will be really nice if there will be a nutritional preferences quiz at the beginning and then you have meal plan automatically generated, with shopping list. With the option to swap recipes if needed."
"1602",409157308,"The headline says it all. There’s great content in here, but the app functionality is definitely not worth the cost of the app. Sorting/filtering features need work."
"1603",409299054,"App only works when it's active, doesn't work in background, completely worthless chinese garbage."

"1606",409362880,"J'aime beaucoup cette application, très utile. Malheureuses, les autres applications associées ne sont présentes que sur le store français, limitant l'usage de tous les services de la banque.  Il serait aussi intéressant d'avoir une possibilité de classer les opérations (voire automatiquement) dans des catégories pour arriver à une gestion de budget en continu à travers l'application."

"1611",409395695,"I did Weight Watchers for many years, until they changed the program and it didn’t work for me.  I rely on MyScore Plus because it is one of the few apps out there that allows me to count the old, Weight Watchers points and stay on the program that works for me.  The app is awesome!  It keeps track of my favorites foods and has a database of hundreds of other foods.  It allows me to track my weight.  It does everything I need!"

"1624",409890132,"After years of playing this game, I finally deleted it today.  The programmers have taken all the fun out of the game and made it the most frustrating game....average every game of more than 50% of the spins resulting in not even a single number.  Who wants to be frustrated when they’re supposed to be relaxing and having fun.  Sorry programmers, you lost finally lost me.  I kept hoping the game would get better."
"1625",409890132,"Great job on this. Much more fun than the AOL version and I loved the AOL version. It takes everything from the classic version that was good and expands it.  Update: I actually took a star away for the unprofessional nature in which the developer decided to take away features I'd already paid for and make me pay another $3 to get them back and buy ""Part 2"". Luckily I like this game so much and I don't mind supporting the developer but it's not cool what you did!"
"1626",409890132,"I only give it *** 2 Stars now  Update your APP people hello 👎!!!  Love love this game have been playing it more than 20 years probably. Very disappointed to say the least!!!  I had deleted it & restored purchase & it's not showing anyone but me for the supreme challenge? Anyone know how to fix that, as help email is no good. I had to completely start from scratch!!! Ugh 👎 that's not right.   What gives? Anyone know what I can do to fix above problems please write a review & help me.   Your help is appreciated please???? 🤔 Question can you download again from purchased in the APP store & it work to show all people that are playing the challenge plus keep my progress?  I would give it 10 Stars if It had been updated to current but last update was in 2017!!!"

The only problem I have with this app is that it loses wifi contact once in a while and I have to shut my computer down and restart to get the app back online.  It doesn't happen very often but when it does happen it is annoying.  Also I can’t find anywhere but I can add subtitles , I have a few movies that I need subtitles floor .  I would give this app four and a half stars, out of five stars."
"1630",410089731,"The protein values listed for meat differ from every website I’ve checked- and I’ve checked at least a dozen prior to writing this review.

"1631",410089731,"Had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work"
"1632",410089731,"I had been using carb manager for a few months. I love it for tracking net carbs and finding out new recipes from other users. It would remind me daily about premium for $40 a year. I thought about it but figured I didn’t need it since I only was using it primarily for tracking net carbs. That was until I got a Fitbit. Which to sync it I needed to buy into the premium. I sucked it up to buy it. Which it a equivalent of 4 hours of my work day. Part of syncing you need to go into the site. Imagine my delight to find out just a matter of 10-30 second after purchasing it on the app and switching to online I was offered it for $30. Wait I just paid $40 for it.... so why offer the discount AFTER I paid for it? I figured I would reach out to costumer service. Joke! They won’t offer a refund of $10 due to inconvenience. They said they don’t offer the discount even if it was shown right after it was paid for.🙄. I am a manager in costumer service and let me tell you, that is not how you treat a costumer. I will be calling my bank to tell them to make sure the $40 gets cancelled. Along with forwarding this review to apple and Fitbit."

"1635",410148139,"Looks like a good app in general, but you’re missing Alaska! Sorry, but one star rating. We have more population than Vermont and Wyoming, which have two stations each listed. You’ve also got Puerto Rico and Canadian provinces. Guess I’ll keep my VHF handy after all."

"1639",410319945,"I'd honesty give it zero stars if it would let me... let me start with this is no QWOP. Instead of you pressing the buttons Q, W, O, and P you now have to rotate TWO joysticks each with four functions for the legs that the joysticks control... the only thing that this states with QWOP honestly is the title, the motivation, and the fact that your character is apparently named QWOP. If you had a hard time using four buttons then have fun with what essentially equates to 8 and half the time you legs are very much exaggerated and don't match what they should be based on where the joystick is moved."

"1645",410395246,"When I try to create an account, it says the account already exists. When I try to recover my password, it says the email doesn’t have an account associated with it. Does this with every email I try."
"1646",410395246,"The app is what you would expect with nite taking and flexibility in customization. My biggest gripe is when your WiFi connection is erratic, a message pops up in the app to warn you are offline and notes are not currently synced; if you’re handwriting a note, the location of the ink writing jumps off point and the jumps again when connection is restored. Really annoying if in a lecture hall with a weak or overloaded WiFi access point"
"1647",410395246,"As a student, this is a game changer.  I can’t really compare it to other applications because this one has done all I’ve asked it to.  I love this program."

"1654",411430426,"This game is a really fun and addicting game but it would be better if you put more animals in the game because there is no point in the game if you have all the animals and you can’t work for more if you put this stuff in the game I would play it more often thank you for reading my message"
"1655",411430426,"I’ve been playin this games for 5 years and I’m love live with it!! (Yes, since 2014) anyways I’ve always wanted to play with my friends, so maybe you could add multiplayer?? Please?! ❤️❤️❤️"
"1656",411430426,"This is an addicting game, but there are things you could add to make it better. What I mean by this is that you should add more features to the animals, such as their movements. I would even love it if there was an option to be one of the animals and you had to survive from a hunter, and you would be able to choose if you wanted the feature to be easy, normal, hard, or difficult. Also, it’s kind of a little bit frustrating when you kill an animal, and you can’t go very up close to it. This annoys me because I would like to get a very good close up to the animal that I killed so I could get a better look at it. I really hope you read this Tatem Games."
"1657",411711646,"I really love this app. It helps me memorize bible verses. However there is one thing I do find a bit inconvenient. I paid an extra 3 dollars to get the NKJV sense that’s what I like to read out of. However when trying to add my own bible verses to memorize them, it sends me to the web to copy and paste. I find this a little inconvenient, shouldn’t the NKJV already be in the app? It’s a little nag on such a great app, other then that I really recommend this app to anyone who is trying to memorize bible verses."
"1658",411711646,"I’ve started using this app a few days ago and I’m already in love with it. My one and only complaint is some of the wallpapers don’t fit the iPhone XS Max screen. A minor complaint, but it’s super useful to glance at the screen to refresh/test my memory when in line at the store, a stoplight etc. Please fix it when you get a chance. Thank you so much for this awesome app!!"
"1659",411711646,"I love this app! For some reason it has started to have a glitch when I’m doing the typing quiz and scrolls back up to the top so I can’t see what blank I’m on without scrolling back down. It does it after every word. Very annoying when working on long verses."
"1660",411766326,"I’m on an iPhone 8. The app does not allow me to scroll through courses; it’s stuck at the top of the page no matter what. It also defaults to me, not my son, so I have to change the profile every time I log in. I won’t be able to easily review course material without finding a desktop computer."

Messaged them again for refund but no reply. Then called them. Reply was “ the person left hence there was no reply. However it’s just as well since the reply wouldn’t have changed.” Don’t care attitude!! Customers will also soon stop caring.... plenty of options to try....

Long story short, they never even called the course, tee time wasn’t changed/canceled and we were charged....  never using this app again, DELETED!"

"1669",412792865,"I had the SkyDroid app on my android phone and really found it easy to use and full function. Besides distances to the green, it showed distances to hazards, I could measure my drive distances, including club selection, but most importantly (to me), I could use it to keep score with a history of my score on various courses. What a disappointment on my first golf outing with my iPhone with this app when I couldn’t find how to enter my score. I assumed it was the same app I had used on my Android phone. Wrong! I should have known from the name SkyDROID that it was originally written to run on the competition and another clue should have opened my eyes when it was less money which typically means less function. I give it 1 star for “distance to the hole”, but if you’ve used this app before on an android device you will be disappointed with this version. I found several free apps with much more functionality. I am currently using SwingU."
"1670",412792865,"I had the android version and recently got an iPhone. Why can’t I keep my score and putts on this phone? I don’t see scoring even offer. It use to be right next to the hole number."

"1674",413511993,"I have been a long-time user of this app, going back to the iOS 4 days. It was always so accurate and reliable, such a useful app. Now though, I have my doubts. This app has not been updated in about three years, and I can tell that it does not work as well as it used to. I would love to continue to use this app, so please update it. I used to recommend this app to everyone, but I cannot anymore."

I have changed it to Spring & have examined other nearby screens and no floating box. There is only the open empty box in the lower half of the picture. I love the game and have completed other series of the Maple Tree adventure game series and am more than half way through another one. But in this one I am stuck. Please  developers I could use some help here or if anyone who has completed this puzzle would sure appreciate your expertise. I mistakenly presses only 4 stars. The game deserves 5 stars. There is no problem with the game but user error. I the user am apparently   having eye problems or trouble seeing boxes. Or this box is floating too fast, high, low or too much as I am missing it entirely Thank you anyone Candy"
"1707",414835676,"Nice long game - I really enjoyed playing."
"1708",415069562,"Creativity: none really, this type of gameplay has been used a lot before.   Story: Its a fun story, keeps you wanting to play more.  Levels: very repetitive, every level between the last one in each location is basically a filler level to make the game seem bigger.  Progression: very confusing, blob goes from being huge to tiny every level and it isn't clear that during the story when it gets hit it shrinks.  Price: a bit too high. I would say $0.99 would have been worth it."

"1714",415468221,"I thought that this app might be wonderful however, it is getting to be a pain in the butt. All I wanted to do was to create one single group and when I first tried it, easy drag and drop but NOT for all my contacts. I kept getting  a message about not being able to add contacts to my group because of Google exchange and that I had to create a group with a ‘local’ tag, Whatever that means.  So I tried to turn on ‘local groups’ using the slider but that did et work and in order to do so I had to delete my group and start a new one so the ‘local group’ slider turn on would workout now, I still can’t add my contacts I want to the new group, any of them. So, I went, in one day, from 4-5 stars to zero if I could. Also, there is no landscape mode. Only portrait. Another PITA. All I wanted was something simple. SIMPLE.....this ‘ain’t simple’!"

"1720",415850124,"This is still a great supports them all photo and video sync application. Supports most major services, some computer protocols, hardware devices and cameras.  The UI is a bit of a mess, selection can involve many taps, thumbnails are small and not resizable, configuration options are daunting. Try their support web pages for documentation. Once you get set up transfer can be simple and painless, easily backing up your photos to multiple destinations with many options for filing and renaming. Geolocation triggers can be helpful and Siri automation can make kicking off a sync simple.  If you need a powerful photo and video sync app, you aren’t going to find any better than this.  My recommendations: a UI overhaul, and syncing settings and/or destinations between devices."
"1721",415850124,"from the looks of it, new pricing throws previous customers under the bus.  i’ve loved this app but i am very disappointed that they would take a paying customer and switch the payment service on them like this.  i refuse to pay subscription fees and and the lifetime fee to continue to use the software the way i originally purchased it is way more than when i first purchased for 3.99  uncool guys.  if you’re gonna change payment options, make a new version. don’t slip it in an update to trick your customer base like this.  not updating to the new version"
"1722",415850124,"This app is exactly what I’ve been looking for: Wireless transfer Easy navigation Duplicate management  Direct to computer HDD and cloud integration  Custom naming and folder options   By far better than any desktop software I’ve tried, much less an app. Keeps everything organized just like I need, and stupid easy. It had replaced light room and iPhoto for my image transfer from iPhone to iMac. GET IT!!"

"1728",416048305,"It used to be a perfect app, until recent upgrade. It really puzzled me why a photo editing app has to force into social media. Everytime you edit a photo, you will have to “share” it somewhere because it is forbidden to simple save an edited photo to your own album. What a shame."
"1729",416345444,"Adds are unsuitable for this games age group.  Adds you have to sit through and can not close for items toddlers don't use.  Attractive buttons to download other games all over the screen. Come on. Give me a $3 button and no adds."

Tried three separate devices, same problem on all: sound and video sporadically cut out, rarely do both function together as intended. (B) have still been unable to sync the app on both my devices, and (c) today all my custom workouts have disappeared! Frustrating"
"1736",416981420,"Probably the best value you can get for $5 on the App Store. Very easy to understand and follow along. I still have to remove 2 stars because the beginner program in its standard configuration is slightly delusional for any true beginner. You are looking at 6 reps of 12 pushups each on day one without manual configuration. If I could do 72 push-ups in 6 minutes I wouldn’t need the app. That said the reps are configurable to your own pace just make sure you do so before getting overwhelmed!"
"1737",416981420,"Its all good and loving the exercises but one major disappointment is that the video is unable to be fast forwarded. Sometimes I just want to skip the lecture and know what the exercise is really about! And I wish that the exercises would just be categorized by parts of the body so that it would be less time consuming to watch every single video. Other than those two I think it’s an amazing app that provides surplus amount of exercises."

Answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly. Very happy with this app.  I would recommend to any volleyball coach at any level."
"1781",421168738,"Love love love this app. I purchased the pro account over 8 years ago and have been using since. Does everything I need and more!"
"1782",421168738,"We used to keep stats on paper, between three different clip boards between myself (assistant coach) and a couple JV players. They were never paying attention so on top of trying to coach and keep stats, I also had to keep track of their stats. With this app, I can do everything with the touch of my finger! Not only is it easy to use, the stats it gives me are AMAZING. I have never considered half of the analysis it provides. This app is a must have for every volleyball coach at any level."
"1783",421254504,"A few years ago I used to play it all the time. The gameplay is good and they have a variety of songs, but the problem became the ads. When I first got the app there was maybe an ad after every 5-7 songs or something around that. I think that's reasonable since none of the songs are full length so it's maybe an ad every 10-15 mins roughly. Time passes by and smule increases the ads to after every 2 songs u will get one which means getting an ad ever 4-5 mins, doubling the amount of ads. I dealt with it for a while but ultimately quit the game for about 2 years because it just became annoying to play. I played it for the first time in such a long time (after deciding that I would deal with the ads) to see smule actually upped the ads to before AND after every single ~2 min song u play! Now that is what I call just plain greedy and it's ridiculous. Just learning this disappoints me that a game I used to like so much became like this. It's just not worth playing anymore and it's a shame."
"1784",421254504,"I liked the trial but it takes too much to get to play the songs you want to play."
"1785",421254504,"I’ve had this app for years and I really loved it for a while. I recently revisited and it’s changed to say the least. It takes for ever to load. Compared to other games I have  played, this takes the longest to open (I have an iPhone 8). The amount of ADs is obnoxious. There are Advertisements at the beginning and end of songs. I am having issues with the 3 and 4 finger taps. This was an issue on my last phone and it’s still an issue now.   It takes forever to earn coins to buy new songs and the free ones are not as updated as they use to be. In all honesty I would not recommend this game until at least the AD spam is dialed back a bit."

"1789",421894356,"I really like how I can organize playlists of podcasts! Then they are automatically in the order I want them. And I can change the order anytime I want!"
"1790",421894356,"Been using PodCruncher for several years now. Never had a single problem. I’ve never even thought of using another App. I’m very happy."
"1791",421894356,"I’ve been using this app now for years and not much has changed. GOOD. Keep it this way! I am absolutely anal when it comes to managing pods.   I’ve tried Stitcher, original Podcast app, other podcast apps, and I can’t break away from PodCruncher. PodCruncher simply just works. No frills, no ads, it just does what it’s supposed to do: play and manage podcasts.   I subscribe to 52 podcasts so I need a basic podcast app to manage them all. I can create different playlists (my weekly shows, “specials” that I save for travel and if I run out of hours in the week, “boring” podcasts that I fall asleep to), change the order around, and play around with the playback speed with ease.   Thank you so much for this app. In a world where Silicon Valley tries to read your mind and be intuitive and over complicated things, this app is a savior from it.   My only complaints are that it doesn’t work with Siri (like all 3rd party apps) and sometimes when I have 3 media apps on at the same time (like PodCruncher, Spotify, and Music), it gets wonky and my iPhone only likes the play Music. Just make sure you close all media apps before playing PodCruncher for the best playing experience."
"1792",421998342,"I love this game it is kind a like real life you will love this game is awesome but you can stay in one area but it’s still awesome if you play this it’s like it will blow your mind you’ll probably love it so much I’m glad I have this app even though it didn’t cost money I actually kind a like it so you guys have to play it but it’s not the best game I’ve been still great but not the best OK done"

I didn’t change anything w my tv but now the app won’t let me watch any shows.   SO FRUSTRATING!"

Now I’m not to busy so I play it and I had to start over but it’s okay I tried the 5 day VIP and it gave me a big boost and the game is fun. The more towers I build the harder it is to find these people but thanks to costumes they stick out like a sore thumb. I suggest organizing the floors in Alphabetical order and separate them from the living spaces. That’s what I do to find stores that need to be fully stocked up so I can earn 10 buck."

The point is to countdown idc about font or anything else pointless, just easy time tracking not that hard."
"1834",424229589,"I guess the developers just GAVE UP on this good game that, according to their own ad, had millions of views on YouTube, etc. One would think with all those views also came millions (or at least hundred of thousands) of downloads as well.   It’s disappointing to see developers just drop the ball on their products and it DEFINITELY makes me hesitant to EVER purchase anything from them again.   Prior to the app just dying on me, I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating. It WAS a good game. At this point though, don’t waste your time/money.  Bad decision on the developers part, imho."

"1846",424912055,"Just completed the game and honestly was unimpressed. Generally, I love adventure games, especially ones with a wink and a nod to their own campy mechanics. This one is overblown in its self-references and unnecessarily pared down to having a single pixel as a face. Like, it took half the game to realize the protagonist uses female gender pronouns. It has style, but seemingly for style's sake. The paper-thin plot is left like a series of archetypal placeholders, Jungian references without fleshed out characters, and yet, there seems to be one character that shines through: the unambitious, possibly stoner college guy voice that took some basic 101 courses on literature and psychology and thinks it sounds pretty rad to work big words into a video game without knowing why or what they mean. Still, walking around a cosmic grotto for a gameplay is ok with me. Kudos for a game about nothing. That's the one thing I actually liked."

A very weak app for a paid app.  I wish there was more educational value and less “fun”. The only valuable part is the tracing and the three videos that correlate to the sound, the drawing is dumb because screen is too small to actually color AND it doesn’t teach anything, and the hide and seek is defective and doesn’t really help them learn anything."

I love this game, I love the smartphone mode with upgrade equipment, and bullet hell games just feel right to me with the immediacy of a touch interface with no lag.  I missed this game a lot when it woulf no longer run on current OS versions, so I was ecstatic to see it revived from the dead.   Sadly, there is one massive issue for longtime players and several really annoying UI issues on an iPhone X.  The biggest problem by far is that, upon opening, I got an error message in Japanese that the save file is corrupt... and had ALL my smartphone mode goodies vanish. Given that I had spent many, many hours grinding literally all but a single item, this was frustrating to put it mildly. At least my purchased items restored correctly.  The remaining annoyances:  - On an iPhone X the curtain graphic extrnds all the way to the edges of the screen, but the touch area does not. This is s disaster, since it means you still need to keep your finger on top of the gameplay to control, and if you drift too far your character just stops moving.  - Likewise on the right side, the buttons aren’t in the extended screen, instead blocking the gameplay area for no reason.  - It doesn’t hide the swipe bar on an iPhone X so if you don’t use the Accessibility trick for licking yourself in the app or shrink the gameplay area needlessly, you will keep bumping it when trying to hit buttons.   - You can’t rotate the screen. This is notably annoying because in the orientation they chose my left hand is on top of the bottom side speaker so I lose the left channel of audio. Flipping the screen like 99% of landscape apps allow would fix this.   - Button targets at the bottom of the screen are wonky, so it is difficult to tap some shop buttons and almost impossible to get the shop previews to display.  - The word “long” in any cutscene text is replaced with “Int32”, which is possibly the most hilarious find-and-replace error ever.  On the positive side, this new version fixes text clipping errors in the shop, and you can full screen it and move the screen to the left or right as well.  C’mon, Cave, at least fix the UI bugs. The save loss bug makes me afraid it’ll happen again if I spend hours grinding rare items."

"1925",430823968,"I mistakenly bought this game thinking it was a universal app and that I could use an MFI controller like on the iPhone version. Well, you can't. I can't fathom why Square-Enix would have controller support for a 4-6 inch screen display, but not for the larger iPad screen.   I'm guessing they won't ever update this either. I also noticed the opening cutscene that plays in the beginning of the game menu is gone and it's just the word version. Not sure why they removed it but there's some really bonehead decisions going by on around here.   Just beware before you purchase. Technically I should blame the Nimbus companion app for not clarifying that FFIII controller support is only on the iPhone, but yeah..."
"1926",430823968,"I just got the iPhone 7 plus and tried download all of the Final Fantasy versions to it finding out that this is iPad version is not supported unless I pay another $15 for no major difference. I'll still give it 4 of 5 stars because it is still a great game."
"1927",430920838,"Just bought the physical board game and loved it. Tried playing a few games of this digital version and it's mechanically broken and ruining the game. It would hide tiles placed by opponents (something that should be knowledge for all players) and even after sending an explorer to the hidden tile it never revealed. It's either a game breaking bug or design flaw of this format that needs to be addressed before you bother to play this."

The worst offense, though, is that now that I’ve got to the point where I want to insert educational drawings saved in my Google Drive, the integration with Drive is broken.

For example, When you finish the game and you have to “tap on it” and then if you want to rematch hit rematch and there’s so much going on that it takes a good 10 seconds at least and that is for every game. The same goes for when you want to view a game that your opponent has ended. Another waste of time. The amount of time it takes when you made your final move the hearing play to go through all the theatrics to be able to move onto the next game is also a waste of time. I do not understand the purpose of collecting these “dice masters” set. Maybe children enjoy that but I can’t imagine adults do. My biggest frustration is how difficult it is to win dice with a scratch off. Also how difficult it can be to beat a Dice master when you have zero bonus rolls."

I also appreciate the array of colors available to use as this helps me to organize events by colored groupings.  I wish the app would be updated for the iPhone XS Max so it could take advantage of its larger screen. The app is currently sized for a smaller phone so there are two large black blank areas on the top and bottom of my screen.   The addition of an integrated to-do list would be great as well.

My son is actually learning quite a bit blithely blowing up the virtual batteries - and figuring out how you have to connect them to blow up 4 at the same time, instead of just a paltry 2.  The tutorials that accompany the lessons (and the mistakes) are pretty clear.   If you are looking for a puzzle game - this ain't it.  But if you are looking for an introduction to circuits and electricity, then you have a winner.  No parts to lose, simple pick-up and the melted wires are self repairing.   My very paltry complaints: i wish the lightbulbs would grow brighter and dimmer to reflect different power levels, and the interface is a bit repetitive and rigid."

So if I drive for over an hour I can get breakfast or lunch (they don’t serve dinner...) We don’t need apps so much as we need vegan restaurants!

Here are the reasons why I like the aps: -Providing six main circuit models let me create lots of light bulb-battery-key combinations and each time the user supported by the constructive feedbacks. -Since it is online, it is safe so no chance to get en electrical shock by accidentally. -App lets me to explore scientific evidences about the incorrect pathways such as short circuits in a very funny way as well as the correct ones."

Cute music, gorgeous graphics and very quirky atmosphere add up to a wonderful game to show off your iPad 2's graphic capabilities. Dialogue hints at eastern European origins but I think it adds to the uniqueness of the game. Plus the home planet is a cool, one-eyed turtle/dinosaur jamming out to tunes! Who thinks of that! You'll want to get this one... Trust me! Paaa pare paaa pare...  2/2019 - Any news on a sequel? Kickstarter can help with money!"

It is very customizable as you can choose the cards you wish to learn and the language you wish to learn FROM. Then you can change the “from” language at any time. I went ahead and paid for the extra sets of cards and am very glad I did. The total vocabulary in the ML system is huge. Hope I live long enough to get all the way through it."

You can think, if I have taken great shot and video doesn’t get saved in gallery then it will ruin whole effort! After very few minutes, app start to cling. Sometimes app is shooting video in faster speed automatically. It has ruined many great shots. In this condition, video saved in the gallery looks like distorted, just like if you are playing high quality video in cheap phone. In the beginning I thought it is my phone hang issue.

Note, that it is clearly printed and legible. It just saves me some time from having to type it all in since I have about 30 items to go through.  Also, listing it as FREE is misleading. It should be noted somewhere on the product page that it is “in fact” a trial and you only get 3 uses to “experience” the product before you “have” to sign up for a premium membership.  Overall, the app has a lot of potential.  @Developer, your reply suggests that you either didn’t read my review or understand what was written. I’m stating that your product is misleading. It is NOT FREE, it is a very limited TRIAL and needs to be advertised as such."

"2082",439628153,"I love this app so so very much. These games are so relaxing and fun. I have a few suggestions for the game. I feel you should add a baby store with cribs, strollers, and bouncers and many more supplies for babies. You should also add a pet store with pets that you can take to your house for example cats, dogs, birds, fish, and so many more. You should also add other houses for a bigger families and more cars and a garage, if the game has so many characters it should have houses for more families, for example they should have a basement as well. You should also add more characters for example you should add Office workers , police  officers, fire workers, mailmen and many more. You should also add a pool for everyone but not as another app you should add the pool to the my play home app not as another app that you have to buy. You should also add more clothing to the clothing store for example if you will add a pool then add beating suits. You should also add a furniture store where you can buy new furniture for your house and redo your house so you can customize it in your own unique way. I think you should also add leg cast to the hospital and crushes. Thank you so much for listening I hope you can find a way to fit as much as you can possible thank you."

I don’t want to have to uninstall and reinstall for fear of losing all of my data for the last 3 months. I need the developers to fix this bug and update it again ASAP!  PLEASE!"

"2090",439873467,"Didn't update right away and now it won't update? Was there a deadline? Tried in the App Store and on app plus the pop-up on the app itself...nothing! Flashes back and forth but goes back to Update....love this app but this is frustrating!!! Also now have to use coins if you want to begin with only the edge pieces!!! Didn't have to until recently...not fair since I play all the time!!!  Adding to this review...purchased Cuties puzzles but they wouldn't download even tho it said the pack was...no download line but puzzle now says. Restore but same thing...grrrrrr...??fix it???   April 4...still love the app and look forward to free monthly puzzles...use the app daily!!! One problem this month--when I start each new puzzle I have to check my settings...before this they were logged in how I had set them--not so for April...reverts back to lowest level every new one  Dec. 14...still love the app but this month we have a puzzle between puzzles for the month that requires not only to have the internet to see the mystery piece but the internet to download separately...again grrrrrr...then you have to surrender 100 coins to download it...I can do it because I do a lot of puzzles but 100 seems a bit high...some problems with download too...  Feb. 22...again--still love the app & work puzzles all the time...however...of late have had many freezing issues where it doesn't move & in order to get into the puzzle or download more I have to close the app & go back in!!! Often several times....grrrr again!!! Do you all even read these ratings anyway???  April 9...still love the app but some problems still persist!!! Again--do you ever read these--seriously!!! Having issues with app freezing & if doesn't correct have to close down, wait & hope it will clear!!! Very annoying !!!😈👿...latest surprise: part of my coins disappeared & I hadn't bought anything!!!   Aug 12...Again...grrrrrrr!!!...Still having issues & it's not getting better...still freezes on a regular basis but still no resolution or upgrade to this...additionally when I tried 2 download a new puzzle (Bridges) there were mucho problems & it wouldn't download the & had problems that resulted in problems with the apps whenever my WiFi is on...I emailed you & you did reply to delete the entire app & reload & (supposedly) I could restore it....that doesn't solve the problem of the points taken from my totals...plus the download won't probably restore those already done, etc.    (see Aug 12 review...did what I was instructed from the developer (via email) but no results or contact since!!!) double grrrrrrr!!!!!  Sept 21...Do you people even read these reviews???? Apparently not!!! Even though I enjoy this app & do the puzzles the speed of change has slowed down to a crawl compared to when I first downloaded the app several years ago...takes forever for the puzzle app to appear-several seconds of black screen...I did hear from the developer who promised to reset my points after an app in the shop proved to be not tested or viral...no points restored as yet                                                             Dec 3...a still love the app but glitches r still a problem!!!...did get 2 emails from ximad 2 send them some info but some of the info is hard to 2 find as instructed or my iPad Air is retarded!!!...takes a good 20+ seconds after bringing up the app for main choice screen appears...still having major freezing issues...sometimes the only thing that unlocks it is 2 get out of the app & start over!!!...very annoying & frustrating...the app did not do all this when it was first loaded & used...I know I am not the only one with these problems...  April 1st...(and not an April Fool post)...Kudos for some problem solving on my previous issues, at least they have disappeared for the most part—still have to navigate the new screen which is more consolidated than previous one...still love this app and work it daily...  Dec 3, 2018 Much better and so far nothing like previous issues and screen navigation is ok. Love this app and play daily🤗   Mar 30 2019 Improved and much better but another oops has appeared...now the 9 cards to turn over one for points that appear each day don’t show up and movement from one puzzle to another is very slow and often hesitates before moving along. Do we need an update to resolve these issues???                                                     July 18 2019 Some of the issues mentioned above still create problems...now when you get the pop up to move on it says “watch an ad” but there’s never an ad available so you have to shut down and move on...also happens with the card match pop up...do you even read these? Seems like it continues, regardless of the reviews....   September 5 2019 Still like the app only now there is another problem with the bonus cards for extra points—after they display and rearrange as a fan & indicates to check for an ad for bonus ad...it says there is no ad, try again later—9 out of 10 times it does this...very regularly do you get a chance at anything else to earn more coins!!! It hasn’t always done this—in the beginning it worked with an ad without the notice..!!! Seems like this glitch could easily be fixed....  September 19 2019 Same issues as described in the last THREE reviews...AGAIN, DO YOU EVEN READ THESE REVIEWS??? It would appear not-no response to these reviews as yet!!!"
"2091",439873467,"I had an issue with puzzle pieces being all “black” on some of my purchases. But I think this “bug” has been fixed. More fun than real jigsaw puzzles and  I don’t have to turn the pieces over!!! . My grandson does  the puzzles with less pieces. I always make them with 630 pieces and some of the puzzles are more challenging due to the pictures. I love this app!!! I have even stopped playing the apps for slot machines as I found them very boring after making the jigsaw puzzles!!! Your selection of pictures are awesome and I can choose various groups!  Thank you!!!  I am thinking of purchasing the VIP package for one year. If the developers should read this I would like to know how I can contact the developer or the company who produces this app. I love all the puzzles and I keep playing for coins to buy puzzle packs but I spend too much time watching 30 second videos to get coins to buy packs. I probably will NEVER make them all but It is so relaxing to make the puzzles even with 630 pieces that turn. I also have my foster granddaughter make them with 24 or 36 pieces. Keep it up. This is an app that is well worth it. Thank you for all the puzzles!"
"2092",440045374,"I’m truly in love with this game,however...There has s a FEW complaints. Ok, when you start the game you get 10 gems/crystals for FREE! And Dragon City gives you eight, so that PROVES Dragon City wants you (& push’s you) to buy more gems/crystals. But back to the point. Dragon Vale is a overall a AWESOME game to play! But I do have a reason to give it four stars, but I’d rather not because of how much I like it. Number one PLeASe give original players like 20-hmm..maybe 100 gems/crystals FOR FREE! I’m not a “Original” player but I know how much they’d probably LOVE to have that. THaNkS!  -JAiNDeN AnIMaTiOnS!!  ~WATcH SUPER BOWSER LOGAN..! You’ll laugh yO PAnTs oFf!!"
"2093",440045374,"It’s not a bad game, but it lacks the ability to really capture my attention, it just gets boring. There are no battles so there really isn’t an objective, and yes I know battles aren’t the only thing that make games interesting, but still. And yes there are seasonal events that are kind of fun to participate in, but they have a cool down time so you have 5 minutes of fun before waiting five hours just to do it all again. There is a competition which gives you more fun but it’s just an elemental race, so yeah. Anyway that is what I think of the game."
"2094",440045374,"Great game when it doesn’t take a year to load in and doesn’t crash on startup repeatedly."
"2095",440488550,"I have owned this app for over a year I guess? And the seek bar and swipe to seek functionality was broken back then and it is broken now.

"2096",440488550,"I’ve been using PlayerXtreme Pro for several months. It’s a very good video player. It can play some videos that other players are unable to play.  It’s the closest thing I’ve found to a universal video player.  However, it needs a couple of improvements:  1. I enter the user name and password to connect to my Windows system and click “Save”.  However, if I close the app fully, I have to renter the account and password the next time I run it.  I want it to save the logon so I don’t have to re-enter it.  2. It needs to have controls to delete and rename videos while browsing the file list."

I prefer purchasing for … ummm… $10…  I don't think devs understand how many apps people might have; not just photo apps. They add up; people should do this funny thing called ""budgeting"". Ask Elizabeth Warren.   Second: maybe I didn't know or notice until recently: Does this edit just portraits? If so, is  a change planned? I'm hoping to move into more into pet photography; a few effects have recognized a couple animal faces and trump's but having access to more would be great.

If there is a new verb and it is not on the app you will likely conjugate it correctly based on the form of the verb after practicing with this app.  For really getting good at conjugation this app is awesome."

I’m sorry to say I could even start a proper evaluation of this one, as it is so determined to collect my data before even slowing me to use it. The opening 3 minutes with this app includes personal data (standard, age, weight, height, birthdate), followed by an aggressive advert for pro version (with large timer as if they need to convert you within 30 seconds!) and then they want a Facebook account or create new account to login. I have yet to see one exercise? (Or a terms of service and privacy policy?)  For me accounts should be optional until I decide I want the features of storage or multi-device sync etc.   So far, this app was more in your face about sign up than any I had evaluated. It may be good, I never got there I’m afraid."

Transferring photos I gotta keep them at Keep? dumb  Stickers I gotta re-download them and worst, hrs to track previous purchases and even losing them..  Horrible experience, and as we change phones frequently each year it’s seriously annoying.  Please fix the mess, make messages and photos transfers more intuitive. You guys are LITERALLY the one and the most annoying item that stops people from switching over to new phones. (especially those who are technologically challenged).   People, encourage your friends/ group to switch over to other great services such who BACKS UP/ SAVE IN THE CLOUD of your chats/ photos . a more seamless experience.

I really have never experienced another app quite like this. From Brian Hardin‘s excellent narration of the Bible each day to his familiar closing words, to having a whole community of people from around the world who are accessible through many ways, available to pray for you at all times. Although most likely you will not meet many of these people, their lives and stories will become an important part of your life and prayers nonetheless. It’s an amazing feeling to hear someone say that they are praying for you specifically and to be able to reach out to someone even on another continent whose voice you have heard. This app can help change your walk with God if you let it."

In Numbers I write a formulas that inserts a “<“ at the beginning of an email address and “>” at the end. With the contacts name in the first column and the addresses formula in the second column, I simply import and manually paste. This creates is one paste my whole list. Easy as pie.

Of the many utilities I have downloaded, mailshot pro is by far the most useful one. In addition writing any problems to Peter, one always gets a response that he will look into it and the support is absolutely tops.  IOS9 I was very worried when I heard that the app no longer could select a group mail program as I send out a group of about 80 emails.   The two ways to work around the IOS9 change are excellent. If I am composing an email to a group, I do it in MailShot, if I am forwarding an email, I copy the group list from mailshot onto the clipboard and and paste it into the blind carbon copy line in mail. A little extra work but hopefully Apple will shape up and allow the app to work as previously."

The aspect ratio isn’t adjusted so the controls are too far for comfort and the wrong buttons get pressed continuously. The intro isn’t skippable. The game screws with all the sound on my phone.  Then there’s gameplay. Half the gnome’s shots don’t even damage the monsters; they just disappear. The panda will sometimes randomly die when slamming instead of killing the opponent. The frog’s tongue does not increase between upgrades 2-3 and gets caught on everything and doesn’t work. It worked well in the android version. And lastly, the bull. When charging, half the time it doesn’t kill the monsters! I just don’t understand.  I’ve played this game for years and when I saw the poor IOS reviews I gave you the benefit of the doubt and paid for the game still. And now I see that I was wrong. Despite the numerous flaws I made it to Dark Lord mode in a few days, but beating that Christmas level is absolutely infuriating when I get the gnome, frog, or panda. Fix your game."

It used to and do so pretty well, but its useless now. Googling the number does a better job.

I mean I love all the new brushes and tools, just a small bug id like to point out. One, the app crashes more easy now. Like if I leave the app or open another tab for even one minute it logs me out and I have to reopen the app, so if I made a Mistake or needed to fix something i cant undo it now. Another, the transparent layers when compressed. For some reason, now when I combine a slightly transparent layer with another it changes it back to its original state which isn't what I want. If there was already an option before to change that id really like to know please. But yeah, apart from the crashing and the layer problem, the app is amazing and without a doubt my favorite drawing app. 10/10  I just hope these problems are resolved."

Now of course she's too old and they are too easy. Why not make more for the older kids!?"
"2268",451287325,"We took a chance and bought the whole pack because my kids loved Monkey Preschool Lunchbox. My 5 year old loves this, especially the aquarium prizes! We love that there are multiple users and that it adjusts to her difficulty level based on her success in the games. Soon my younger one will be interested too and they can each have their own user in the game."
"2269",451901829,"The sound is remarkably soothing and it's relaxing to play with."
"2270",451901829,"Reading the description, I thought the app would generate movie type ocean sounds in a mechanical way. To me if you could adjust the fade of sounds some way other than the amount of beans, I would appeciate the app. To me it just does sound like  beans in a basket. I would prefer a sound generator instead. As a azuki-sound generator it does work perfectly."

"2293",453571750,"As a former Boy Scout, sailor and someone who has spent a lot of time thinking about how to teach people how to tie knots, this is a truly great tool for learning and teaching knots. You can see the knot from every angle.  The animations are clear and the speed can be controlled.  The color choices  make the illustrations very clear.  You can also view static images of the animations by moving your finger left and right across the image.  I especially appreciate the accompanying history, uses, related knots and safety precautions.  They are clear and concise.  It’s a lot easier to learn to tie knots using this app than it is using Ashley’s Book of Knots.  I have recommended it to my friends, family and anyone who expresses an interest in knot-tying."

"2325",454781476,"I. Love this game. Played when I was very young and had great times with friends, and I just now bought this again on my phone for old times sake and can’t believe in almost 7 years there is no sequel to this game or anything like it!? I’m surprised to no extent! I think if you guys released a better and revised and upgraded version of this game it would blow up because the only things wrong with this game is the aspect ratio and graphics and how it displays and the upgrading system and story system and how you progress, if there is an actual story or even a better way of how you do the whole killing zombies to unlock more areas,  I hope you could make it so it’s challenges and some are secret challenges and/or feats that you can achieve with weapons, certain characters (who could have abilities) I’m just saying. This game is amazing, I’m playing it through right now and will do agai and again to waste time when I wanna kill stuff on the go! You guys made a great series and I think you can do it again even better! 😁 also have some ideas on the game and it’s design and ideas for what to put in and love to have some input or at least a hearing. Thanks for reading🙂"
"2326",454802329,"This game is one of my favorites, but it needs some upgrades. I think the f-15 Eagle, YF-23 Black Widow II, and the SU-50, should be added. If there's ever another good update, than that's what I want. I also think rortos should fix the f-35, because it’s way to fast and maneuverable when it gets to 150 knots. The f-35 shouldn’t have the exact same maneuverability as a harrier. Get good. Anyways, I think this game needs a major update that includes the things said above. If they don’t add at least one thing said above, then I won’t like this game as much as I do now, and I’ll also drop two stars to make it two stars. So rortos, start working. 😉👍"
"2327",454802329,"Great game, realistic and fun. You guys should make a Hot Shots/Firefighting version."

I’ve yet to find a solution to this as sometimes closing and reopening the app works, sometimes it doesn’t. Occasionally I’ll be playing and I’ll get a text. When this happens the game just slows way down. I tried updating the app and the tables but it says it’s all up to date. Very fun app as I really dig me some pinball and love all of these tables. This is just a tad frustrating."
"2343",455826958,"Pinball Arcade was amazing, you’d get to buy new tables ever few months and there was always something awesome to play.  Now, there hasn’t been anything new table wise in close to a year and old bugs haven’t been fixed in about that long.  I’ve spent several hundred dollars on tables across all systems (iOS, switch, Xbox 360 and steam), I’m starting to worry that they might shut down the ability to download those tables."

Just as there are different seasons and a variety of teas... There’s different ways of influencing the minds of the masses. A VPN gives access to the world’s entertainment options, yet many shows are still unavailable - and leading streaming providers such as Netflix don’t operate in China (great fire wall paired with Chinese protectionist practices towards their larger companies - which are all controlled/unglued by the Chinese government).

"2387",459035295,"This game is fun, but it is very pay to play. If I were a dev I would take the coins off of the purchasing a player option. It just doesn’t make sense to have to give up two forms of payment for a better team."
"2388",459035295,"Game was okay , I give it 2 star because the way the game was more like pay to win. You sacrifice too  much fund for a season to get all your player to be on top and then season end. New season start and now you have to start everything all over again, you can’t do much to upgrade the team because you sacrifice too much fund for the previous season, so now you have to start all over again to upgrade your team, it a waste of time or if you want to get them instant strong you need to pay more to get more token then you can upgrade your team to the strongest. So basically this game is like a pay to win, not a skill to win. If this game is a Skill to win then I would have rate it 5."

"2390",459189186,"I was really enjoying the game up until the prison safe puzzle with the green triangle. Unfortunately the “Cheat Book” is no help and basically tells you that to move on you need a to solve the puzzle. I wish there was a way to bypass the puzzle or rest it to something else like the wiki suggests but even when I step out of the room or reset the game the puzzle is the same.  If a developer is reading this please help me out! I really want to continue playing this visually beautiful and plot based game!"
"2391",459189186,"This game has great graphics and I love the tone.  The puzzles were interesting and generally well done.  There are two main drawbacks for me.  First, I think the game is too short given it’s price.  Second, I think the hint system, which is crucial for a game like this, has a terrible flaw.  Generally I don’t care that you have to play a mini game to access the walkthrough.  The problem is that it shows you the walkthrough for the area you’re in, regardless of where you might be in the chain of puzzles.  So you might have access to 6 or 7 areas and not be sure where to go next.  You’ll have to go to each area, play the mini game, and hope there’s something you can actually do there.  This also means that you will sometimes bypass the actual puzzle accidentally because the walkthrough for the area you’re in just has the final solution to another area’s puzzle."
"2392",459313476,"The flaw in this app is that it has Bb Major as having 3 flats WHEN THAT IS Eb MAJOR! I wonder what other flops does it have!"
"2393",459313476,"I really enjoy this app.  I have had it for around eight years and have been consistently satisfied with its performance.  I love how customizable it is so that any user can make meaningful progress.  I would like it if there were a chord progression ear training exercise, but otherwise I can’t think of any way this app could be better.  Excellent!"
"2394",459313476,"This app has not only helped me, an experienced piano player, but I have used it with my piano students for ear training and reading and it has helped them a lot. The only thing I think could improve the app was that if there was a teaching mode. For example, if someone doesn’t know what the Aeolian scale is, there could be a place in the app where they can go for a reference. Other than that, the app is simply a blessing. Thank you"
"2395",460177396,"Great app , very well functioning, easy to access and easy to create an account, they just spam too many emails so that’s why the y get a 4 star rating"
"2396",460177396,"If your into finds my quality content creators especially gaming Twitch is the place to be. The only thing that’s always driven me crazy to the point I almost gave only 4 stars is all the QUALITY broadcasters that are buried in such a saturated market. You must sift through hundreds to find a few hidden gems. “Partner” streams or “Featured” channels have put in the grind and deserve it but some of these other upstarts have no prayer to cut through the noise. With that said the majority of people sitting through directories do not take the time to sift to the streams at the bottom with little to no views. I find that to be the Consoles (XBOX & PS4) fault for making it so ez for any toxic 12 year old with a console can connect and upload toxic trash.

I love using this for anything in my life, personal to-do lists, Tasks, checklists. The customization options are endless. Thank you for developing such an easy-to-use and helpful app!"
"2408",461504587,"This is one of the most versatile applications in the entire App store. Gym schedules, work projects, vacation planning, household organization, meal planning, wedding planning, and pretty much anything else that you can imagine can be collaboratively organized on Trello."
"2409",461504587,"I didn’t know I would like or need this app so much.  But once I started building my to-do lists, I was hooked.  It gets the tasks out of your mind, letting you focus more on work and stress less."

We ended up detouring for over an hour and half in Chengdu urban area and felt extremely confused and frustrated.....  In the middle of one trip, it led us to a one lane secondary route due to heavy traffic on the main one. Somehow, after following the new direction for 15mins if not more, suddenly its algorithm asked us to make a U-turn to go back to the original.....and we thought we somehow missed a turn which we did not....

"2416",462134755,"I am an educational technology specialist, and Puppet Pals HD is, hands down, the finest app for publishing animated versions of student work. Students can take photos of their own drawings and record their voices as their pictures move around the screen. It's great for biographies, facts and virtually any project may have been a poster, paper or presentation once upon a time. This one is absolutely essential for all educators. It's easy to use and super intuitive to use... even for year olds."

They want you to download iexplorer and delete a certain file. It says so on their website yet it gives no further instructions. I have navigated through a bunch of system folders trying to figure this out and I am done! I spent Hours playing this game because I liked it but had I known this would happen AND that rather than the developer fixing it they make the customer try to I would have never EVER spent my time playing this.   I’ve played over 50 iOS games from start to finish and no other game has ever left me in a spot with an unfixable bug.  The only way to MAYBE fix it is to delete the whole game and start over... no promise that will work though and I won’t waste my time any longer. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS THE DEVELOPER DECIDES TO FIX THIS!"

"2448",464309202,"This is waste of time. Why wouldn’t you be able to scan in your quick pic numbers. Why doesn’t this app scan and automatically put in the right “Game” and why would you have an annual section where people can add in their seasonal purchases.   All this is, is a cute app to check your numbers. I can do that when I purchase at the store."

"2454",465092669,"Great app. It’s nice to be able to listen to my games while I’m driving all day since I’m not able to watch them most of the time. But the notifications need to be fixed. I have all notifications turned off except for the one team I’m interested in. Yet I get more notifications for other teams’ games than I do for my own team. What’s the point of setting my notification preferences if I don’t get the ones I chose? This has been an ongoing problem with the app since the 2018/2019 season. Several updates have been released but that problem is still there. And before anyone asks, yes I am running the most current version of the app and iOS."

"2460",465694275,"I’m a huge fan of pinball, but specifically Zen Pinball! If you are a fan of pinball, then this is a must have app.  That said, I’m only able to give four stars because it appears that the tables I’ve purchased on my Android device is not transferable to the iOS platform.  Is that the case?  Seems like if I’ve purchased tables already, I should have to repurchase them on another platform."

Please change this.  4. Have an option on the ground on what they should do there like vomit, dance etc.   5. This is my last thing: if you tap on a sims icon on the bottom left corner you could choose if there sick, dying etc. and you can choose if they have a fever or a heart attack!  Thank you I would like these changes!"
"2469",466965151,"I have always loved this game. Currently I switched phones from galaxy to iphone. However, anytime I try to send my Sims to work or school the app closes itself out. It's honestly annoying. How else am I suppose to make my Sims money, that's were majority of it comes from and its very discouraging when I've loved this game and never had problems with it until now. NEEDS FIXED"

"2477",467703220,"I’m potty training my almost two year old and we love using this app as an incentive to go on her potty! She’ll sit there and get calls from Elmo and just chat and babble with him. It has really helped us, but I would LOVE to get all the calls, especially the ones that tell her it’s time to go potty or the other one telling her that she did a good job going on the potty! So please fix! Thank you!   I’ll be happy to change rating to 5 stars once this issue is fixed, because she is infatuated with Elmo and his calls."

"2486",467953363,"The app works great. The main reason i bought it was for the deer activity by moon phases guide. I never pay enough attention to figure that stuff out on my own and this allows you to plan days off weeks in advance. Also, read the instructions. I didn't and found some of the stuff a little confusing so I emailed their support staff and they helped almost immediately, however all of the answers were in the instructions had i bothered to read them."
"2487",467953363,"Great App. Has not been updated in a while now. What's up with sunrise and sunset times. This app needs some attention."

"2491",468564994,"The game is just perfect takes about two hours plus (not including bonus levels) to finish and yet you never wanna take you hands off it. I played this game when I was 5 and yet I still remember this and remember all the fun I had so I spent 30 minutes trying to remember the name and I am glad I did. Just the best game I have ever played!!!"
"2492",468564994,"PLEASE Fix The Slow Bug!!!"
"2493",468564994,"Still one of the best games on the App Store. I come back every few months to replay the full game."
"2494",468566852,"I know lots of people say “this is the best game ever” but actually in my opinion there aren’t very many levels and I finished this game in 2 days. I mean, at least there are SOME levels, and they’re fun but it kinda gets old. Not very much worth the $5 but if you add some more levels that would be great. Thank you."

"2498",468996152,"This app used to be amazing. Now, there are way too many ads and annoying notifications.  The fee to ship items is ridiculous. I can’t even sell a $5 item without paying $2 in fees. Really? 40% in fees?! That’s absurd and I refuse. I’d rather sell on the side through PayPal or hold onto the item."

"2504",469284907,"I could not get files to print from the Photos app on my iPad on anything but a 4x6 from the photo tray. This time the image was actually a letter sized document and this has been driving me crazy. I even emailed it to myself and tried to print it from the email. Same thing. I purchased another app but my eyes glazed over just looking at it. Too complicated. I googled the issue again and found reference to a couple of HP apps - which I could not find in the App Store, but found this instead (a replacement?) Really strange because the first thing I ever tried was looking for an HP app and I couldn’t find anything, which is why I purchased the other app.   I installed this app, it found the two printers, I picked one, it already knew the file was 8.5 x 11, so the correct tray was selected, hit print, viola!  All done within a minute. Maybe two. This app is so awesome it almost makes me like the printers, which have been nothing but trouble connecting to them through WiFi on a computer. Maybe it’s because they are connected to a computer using windows? ; )"
"2505",469284907,"Deskjet 2600 series does not print well. Before i learned this i got hp to send me a replacement printer same model in hopes the print quality would improve. It did not and now the app is malfunctioning. It spins a long time or doesn’t register at all. Makes using the printer cumbersome. Luckily for hp i love the insta ink program because i would abandon ship altogether."

"2512",469343097,"Pros: it contains the game and it is able to be played to the end of game.  Cons: the frame rate is bad. Looks super choppy. Not formatted for iOS 13 which means you have to use touch screen controls. The buttons are designed for a mobile experience which means auto-shooting and auto-charging. Overall: This game has aged terribly.  This would be an amazing experience on the iPhone 3 or iPhone 4, but it is a laughable experience on The iPhone XS Max. However, they (Capcom) would have to rebuild the entire game from the ground up to make it comparable to the SNES version you remember which means it is not gonna happen."
"2513",469343097,"This game is literally everything I could want for an “I have like 100 hours on my hands how do I use them” kind of game, just I play it even when I do have something to do. I could probably go on a lot longer about how amazing this whole game is but then the review would be really really long.  The only suggestion I would make for this game is that if you get all the achievements you get like a special achievement or some kind of trophy on the achievements screen or something"
"2514",469343097,"So far I love the games graphics and everything but for some reason I can’t figure out a way to save I’ve completed the first few levels and when I got on it later it completely started me from the beginning. This is the 2nd time this has happened. FIX IT PLEASE!!!!"
"2515",469369175,"This is the best racing game. You can drag race, unlock new cars from bosses, and test drive cars. Anyone who doesn't have csr  csr2 and csr classics get it now on android and mobile."
"2516",469369175,"I love this game and it is a necessity for my phone. I’m by opinion it’s better than csr 2 because its straightforward, and easy to conquer"
"2517",469369175,"its fun but you should add real time racing to all three of your alls games and add pink slipping it would increase ur apps profit and it would get more downloads i played racing rivals for the whole time it was up and running and they ended up screwing it all up with some stupid updates hopefully yall add the pink slipping to these games"

"2522",469622080,"I taught for several years and now work as a full time private tutor.  I recommended this to my students when I was a classroom teacher and now I use it with my clients.  Math fact mastery and mastery of integers is one of the biggest underlying problems I see on a regular basis.    This company has three apps that I use CONSTANTLY with my clients and this is one of then (I also loved the behavior management app when I was in the classroom).  I HIGHLY recommend this companies apps to both teachers and parents of students who are struggling in math.  I can't wait to see what they come out with next."
"2523",469622080,"I love this app! I teach high school algebra and many of my students come into my classroom without knowing how to work with positives and negatives. This app is perfect for refreshing those skills. This is a great sponge activity because it only takes about one or two minutes. Where was this when I first started teaching? I highly recommend this app."

Poshmark should consider lowering this fee, and should try to be more competitive with Mercari, who only takes 10% and has a wide variety of shipping options and pricing instead of the expensive shipping Poshmark charges the buyers. They charge nearly $7 for shipping even if the item is one tiny pair of earrings.   Also there is NO WOMENS SUIT CATEGORY. And overall, the gender categories for clothing items are terrible and very sexist."

"2550",471458190,"This game suffers from two massive flaws:  1) There is a bug that lets you undo your turn in multiplayer (after you complete it). This means you can backtrack after a conflict.    2) You can not swap leaders, which removes an important strategy from our disposal.  The game can be great, but it needs a lot of polish. The art is mediocre. The developer seems to have abandoned it."

I asked if the problem was solvable and the lady said yeah at this time we have no solution. Loved the app up until now. I have had this app for over 6yrs."

I’ve never used Safari once in my entire life. But I use Chrome for normal stuff and I used this app for flash.   The rumors about flash crashing the iPad have never happened to me. It has been so smooth for the past 4 1/2 months I’ve been using this site. I hated having to get my computer out just to play a flash game; I guess Apple has to give me something to hate again. I wish I used Puffin years and years before.  Best wishes to CloudMosa, Inc."

It only took about 2-3 hours to finish, but that was with reading fast and not waiting for the dialogue to finish. I would guess it is around 4 hours if you do auto mode or wait for the dialogue to finish.  Not much CG at all, but the story definitely makes up for it, and it is very touching indeed. I would highly recommend for a good read.  Now, I'm off to go find a planetarium and cry :)"

"2574",474121500,"Can you call it a game if there are no choices to make? This visual novel is more novel than game, but it still is an engaging experience. There is full Japanese voice acting and English text, but the graphics are mostly static with minimal animation. But what is great is that this is from the same company that made great visual novels such as Kanon and Clannad, so you get a great story and cute characters. You can put it into auto-play mode and it takes about 4 hours. There’s also a “Novel” mode where the text is shown full screen. I’m hoping that they will bring over more of their visual novels to iOS in English."

"2581",474595631,"Fantastic app. I use it on a daily basis. Very useful, great for presentations on either side of the table. Also, the dev is very responsive. I had a request for the app and he got back to me in just a few hours. If you are looking for the most simple way to do much of the math required in a vacation ownership presentation, you have two options: another app that is much more expensive and performs a whopping three of the dozen or so calculations possible on this app. Or, you can do presentation mathematics, plug in your sales and find your VPG and closing ratio on the fly on a single screen, quickly and cleanly show what the mortgage will be and more. If you work in vacation ownership or timeshare, this app WILL be useful and helpful."

"2590",474807486,"I chose for the app to use my location to help determine nearest emergency shelters. It gave me Florida, N. Carolina, and S. Carolina. Problem is I’m physically in Norfolk, VA.

I like the simplicity of it, but wish that the documentation was a bit better and that updates were given a bit more frequently.  I do use the handwriting features, but find certain gestures to be enigmatic to the recognition engine.  One big suggestion I would give the developers would be to have a handwriting option that lets you notate an entire measure at a time and then click a button or move to the next measure before it’s interpreted.  I tend to write all my noteheads first, then the stems, then the beams, then the dots, and the engine starts recognizing what I’m writing too soon.  Also - a free-form handwritten staff would be VERY useful for jotting down notes and ideas without it being rendered into anything. Otherwise, it’s a great little tool to have with me wherever I go."
"2600",475820434,"I was really enjoying this app, until I discovered that it lacked on of the most basic and necessary features - layers. Reading through their documentation I couldn’t find anyway to use multiple layers, a simple google search came up with the same results. Not having the ability to write for multiple voices for works such as a guitar part, or an orchestral piece where parts split. If I just missed it/overlooked it, but if such a basic feature is so hard to find, that’s not much better."
"2601",475820434,"Love this app, but is there any way to make it so that we can create our own presets/templates? Often times, we write for the same groups over and over and it would be helpful if it were possible to create a template for that group."

The Alarm will NOT Ring OR Vibrate your phone if your phone is set on “Silent” (I’ve missed a few Alarms because I forgot to take it off of Silent after being in a Doctor’s appointment or Church😹)"

"2656",479067148,"haven’t been able to open the app. smh what a waste of money. don’t charge for an app if all it’s gonna do is crash. at that point it’s just a scam."
"2657",479067148,"This app will not work. I paid for an app, so I want an app or my money back. Bull."
"2658",479067148,"Do NOT waste your money. I just downloaded this game along with my boyfriend. Neither of our app works. The app closes as soon as it’s opened. After I bought the app, I read that this app hasn’t worked for at least a year 😡 It’s a shame because I really enjoyed the first APP."

"2661",479159684,"Good"
"2662",479243891,"I have purchased this app, but only half the choices are working. THERE IS NO INFO in the settings. ALL PAGES ARE BLANK! It also says to Check Internet connection (it is working fine on other devices). I cannot figure out how to ""earn"" marbles. I cannot figure out how to create a parent account/profile.  I am exasperated! I really want these apps to work, but they only partially work. Support is totally absent!"
"2663",479243891,"reviews here seem to be fake by the app developer's friends. useless app doesn't have any demo/free version and once purchased, there is no option to return it. The features are useless, not at all kid friendly. Stay away."
"2664",479243891,"Haven't used the apps yet, this rating is based solely on the fact that I could not download the bundle, I had to download each app individually.  I kept receiving the following error ""App is not compatible with your device."" Because of this, I had to pay full price for each app and did not get the discounted bundle price.    Developer/Programmer:  Please Fix ASAP  Note:  the apps work fine on my device and definitely ARE compatible."

"2669",479528827,"Import all photos plus a background(wall) you want to include, touch the one you want to adjust ( size, brightness, contrast,etc), then touch the next that needs adjusting. Easy to overlap or move pictures around.Simple instructions provided.

"2674",479662730,"The game has a great start out It has a great campaign It is a very fun game"
"2675",479662730,"Love it. Been playing when it was released for PC. Gameplay is very smooth, bice port."
"2676",479662730,"Usually works great. Crashing after ios 2.4.1 update on iPhone 7 Plus"

UPDATE: Could you please add a statistic that tells you when or how many times it plays the reality message when we sleep? Thanks!"
"2681",479889140,"This is the most powerful app I've ever used. I had a controlled lucid dream. I heard this app play sound in my sleep. This app works perfectly. When I was in hypnagogic state I did not hear sound play, but when I did go into REM sleep where I dreamed every time they played sound only in the REM sleep. When I was in a hypnagogic state again, I did not hear sounds, but when I went back into a REM state again when I was dreaming I did hear sound play again."
"2682",479889140,"This app is pretty fun. It’s interesting to see the sleep cycles. I am still working with the audio cue. When I’m actually I’m REM I never hear it. The few times I’ve heard the cue I was already awake. Still playing with it."
"2683",479943969,"A little disappointed because the music does not play in the background and that’s a big part of the user experience especially when you paid for the app because the free version makes you get on WiFi. Disappointed."
"2684",479943969,"It’s 2019. Unless we’re being purists, why can’t this be full screen? And if we are being purists, at least fill the unused screen area with some artwork."

"2686",480079300,"I turned on the notification to receive instant message from potential buyers of the goods I published.  However, I received much more advertisements and unrelated promotions pushed by the app.  There is no place to limit the notification to actual messages from potential customers, so I have to tolerate searching for actual customer’s message in a bunch of rubbish ads.  I will not use this service once the goods is sold."

This can read QR code and any barcodes of books and other products I tested including American, British, Japanese one. And you can directly to search Google or Amazon for them and find them in a moment. It's spiraling and very convenient!! History feature isn also the best. This also has read URL and mail address. It works better.  I don't know why this perfect amazing app is totally free without ad. But I feel secure using it because this app is made in by Japanese company listed on a market."

"2695",480219484,"We have offices all over the United States but I was having a hard times figuring out where all the offices are.

"2698",480375355,"Hi All,  This game is the greatest value out there. This is a great game and the originals make it even better.  Now, I know some people are going to gripe about the graphics in the bonus feature of the 1980s BT3.  What happened there is that the developers were porting the Apple 2 GS versions of the games (1 and 2) to the iPad.  There was no GS version of the Bards Tale 3, much to my disappointment back then.  Thus, they ported the Apple 2 plus/e/c version over.  So, Apple 2 owners have the authentic ports they had back then.  There was a better looking version of BT3 though - the Amiga version, but I have learned that it was buggy.   Thus, including the non-buggy version of BT3 was a good call, even with the low quality Apple II graphics.  (If you love the originals, the remastered versions for PC/PS/Xbox are practically perfect. There you can find pixel perfect graphics and a fantastic gaming experience.)  This iOS app is a 5 star game, no question."
"2699",480375355,"Wonderful game. Using a Nimbus and loving it!"
"2700",480375355,"I’ve been wanting to play this game!  I’m glad I finally bought it!"
"2701",480688850,"It didn’t even work it just said limited chance don’t buy this app it’s useless"
"2702",480688850,"When I got this app, I tried to enter it but it closed automatically. I tried restarting my phone, but it won’t work. This is a waste of money... Don’t buy!"
"2703",480688850,"Anything over 50% good chance of a snow day or late opening .  It’s always correct!"
"2704",480805652,"Game freezes up"

But this one 😢😢😢😢 I wish the game had more tools and more accessories. The only 1 thing I like about it is that it’s very educational.... Yup, That’s the only thing I like, The other things.......... Meh. I guess I’ll be great if you can curl his hair, And, Like, Why can’t you take out the beard and the hair? This is VERY disappointing.. I’ll give it a 1 since there’s only one thing I like about this game. ( Don’t get Mad pleaseee...😰😰😥😥😓😓😓😓😓😬😬😬"
"2717",481623941,"So I was looking for a free hair salon game and found this. I was really excited but this is junk. This can be sexist in a way because it has no girls witch basically makes it say “Oh, Christmas is only about boys” but there is more to Christmas than SANTA and TREES. The tree even looks like a boy. Be creative!"

Unfortunately, anytime you spend more then 90 seconds making your collage, the app closes and loses all of your work.

The Roku Chanel gives you over 1,000 free movie choices alone, then there are so many other free streaming Apps. Just pickum and load them up ! If you choose This gadget Could  either be your answer to cutting the cable cord completely  or reducing the monthly bill to just WiFi,"
"2727",482066631,"this app is absolutely terrible. it takes me 5 minutes just to pause my show because this app won't load. also, the most glitchy app that i have EVER used"
"2728",482158461,"Everything works right. The options the computer play. Plus the update is amazing makes the gameplay even better and really love the multiplayer modes."
"2729",482158461,"The game is amazing and I've been playing with that game for years. Is it possible to give us the option to load the old interface (before the latest update) it's more professional and more clear that the one released with the latest update."

"2735",482465886,"I had a 25 mb video with the first option that says 70% it only went to 17 mb it was supposed to go to 6 mb ... but I think since its a paid app you should get to pick the size of your video ... next option got it to 22 mb and next option got it to 3.3 mb !! I wanted 8mb so it didn’t work for me .. I give it the 2 stars because its easy to use"

"2746",483336864,"Didn’t go to the right website even after screen splashed with ads."
"2747",483336864,"This app is junk."
"2748",483336864,"This is useful and great! Thanks! All the features that is built in this is great!"
"2749",483353496,"TL;DR: Zero stars - Plays sound even when you turn sounds and music off in settings - Still forces you to watch ads after every other turn even though this is a paid app.   Full Review:  There is a front on the home screen that constantly says “ribbit” every two seconds. I turned off both the sounds and music in the settings but the front still makes noise. What’s the point of turning off all sounds if the frog is still going to make noise? It’s super annoying as the frog keeps making noise every other second and no way to turn it off. Further, and even more annoying, is that the click sounds when you tap icons still plays even though I have sounds turned off and the games still make noise and sound effects such as the frogs saying ribbit.  This app is absolutely unplayable when in an environment where you need to be quiet.  I wanted to contact customer support or email feedback directly to the developers instead of leaving a poor review but there was no contact information on the app.  Hopefully this gets fixed. I’ll be sure to update this review if I hear anything back or the issue gets a fix.  Another issue is the fact that this is a PAID app. It costs $1.99 yet there are still ads! What did I just pay $2.00 for? The whole reason people pay upfront for apps is so they don’t have to watch ads! I’m not paying money to sit and watch ads or to have to pay even more money to get rid of them. Completely defeats the purpose of purchasing a paid app. If I wanted to watch ads there are plenty of FREE apps on the App Store that allow me to do so. Paying most of the FREE apps with an in app purchase of a couple dollars or less gets rid of ads completely so why is your app $2.00 with ads? No thanks!!   I very highly DO NOT recommend this app unless they make it fair and stop playing ads for an app that we already have to pay for in the first place."
"2750",483353496,"I paid for no ads option on my iPhone. I also downloaded the game on my iPad but it wanted me to pay again for no ads, and no restore purchase button to be found.  Tried tapping app support button and couldn’t find a way to leave a message. NOT HAPPY; wouldn’t have purchased the option if it doesn’t work on all devices!!"
"2751",483353496,"This is the best game ever! I love it"
"2752",483910781,"The reminders for vitamins and water and exercise. I like the database that builds up my food choices."
"2753",483910781,"I thought I would never be able to lose weight because of my slow metabolism but with this app I have lost 20 lbs and feel great. Very worth the money!!!"
"2754",483910781,"Just missing the option to have recurring foods on select or all days and the Apple workouts tracking (other than walking). Otherwise great!"
"2755",484090401,"I was working on a very difficult character and clicked “yes” at the end, in order to eliminate the character the stupid genie gave me, otherwise it would have come back over and over again and my character wouldn’t have ever been in play.  So, I clicked “yes” only to find out it was some fictitious character and I was told I was being watched for cheating. SCREW THAT! This game is for fun. I wasn’t cheating! I was trying to eliminate a character so that I could try again and maybe the dumb bot could guess the person I was actually thinking of. The fact is, this genie is a process of elimination bot and it has become so vague that it’s not hard to fool the genie over and over again. Try playing for Clive Bundy. Good luck. (They’ll fix this quickly I’m sure, but it was impossible to get the genie to guess him). This game used to be a fun way to pass mindless time, but they have gotten a little to big for their britches. If I have to worry about being called out as a cheater for something for which I neither pay nor use, you can keep your stupid app. I deleted mine and will not be downloading it on my children’s phone. Screw you Akinator. You can’t guess half my characters anyway and you treat your customers like crap. Good luck with your ridiculous app. I’m out! What a bunch of bot bull crap!"
"2756",484090401,"This should be in top 10 iPhone guessing games"

I can send you the screen shot that showed the 200,000,000 win if you tell me how to send it. Also, the begining gifts always puts me back to day one. I haven’t missed a day in more than 10 years."

And then I downloaded the app in the MIDDLE IF SUMMER and it said he would be here in 171 days and then I did the math and I calculated to be RIGHT. this is insane. I love this app and definitely will be using it. !!"
"2774",486270850,"I just love everything about Christmas. Family, presents, giving, and Santa! I have seen others reviews and their storys and I'm getting this app in July but I hope I can have fun with it next Christmas! I'm only 11 and I'm having trouble believing so I hope this will help me!! 🎄🎅🔔❄Merry Christmas!!  😄🎄🎁❄🎅"

"2776",486355738,"The new app update is very responsive. I think it was worth the rebuild. Good work bank people!"

"2778",486355738,"Good application!"

"2781",486645049,"Good calculator.  Easy to use and big numbers."
"2782",486692623,"I love the moe-tivational aspect. It would be cool if you had choices in the story between workouts to make it more like a light novel."

"2787",486717857,"Game is really good and no glitches it is really good for a boring day"
"2788",486947533,"The mini game where you dispense punishments is broken. The timer does not change, and none of the buttons work."
"2789",486947533,"For some reason, every time Bonus time appears, no buttons seem to work and I have to close my tab after every level. Otherwise, I love this game! Please fix!"
"2790",486947533,"You cannot choose any punishment for the offenders. The clock is frozen and none of the buttons work. Please fix this."

"2795",487126596,"I love this calculator. It’s perfect. I hated the ads and decided to try other calculators. Nope, this one was truly the best. So I swallowed the $2.99 to get rid of the ads. I got charged and the ads stayed. Now what? I contacted Apple and they said I can get a refund, but I love this calculator. I contacted the developer and haven’t heard from them. Five stars for the app and zero stars for the developer.  Updated review: They responded to my problem quickly and fixed it! Five stars for the app and the developers response time."
"2796",487126596,"I use this on my phone all the time."
"2797",487127942,"Super"
"2798",487127942,"You must press = after every function or the calculation will be way off."
"2799",487127942,"Likes how it shows the breakdown in any calculation. This to me is unique."
"2800",487162791,"I love this app. I am using it with my bilingual 1st grade class. It is awesome because I can create my own spelling list. My students love to use this app because it helps them practice the spelling of each word. Their grades have improved since we started using it. I wish that when I create my spelling list, I could it could be saved in all of my devices but any away I love it even though I have to create each list one at a time. Thank you so much"
"2801",487162791,"I have kids ages 9, 6, & 2. I've been looking for tool that will help in teaching my kids Spanish. It's important in learning the phonics associated with each letter and this application does a great job, in fact in may be one of the best for what it does. There are pre-defined spelling list but then you can also create your own. Most of the program is highly customizable which is often an issue with so many other apps. Kids are also rewarded with another fun side activity after completing a spelling test. The app was so great that I also bought the English version in order to practice our spelling words. Even though this app was made for kids, I also enjoy using it as well to work on my Spanish grammar. If you are learning Spanish it's a great app for your collection."

"2805",487250856,"Super easy and fun"
"2806",487285735,"I uploaded this app last night and am truly amazed.  It’s completely free, no tricks or gimmicks.  An ad every once in awhile during playback but they are short and few.  I’m extremely happy with it.  I use Netflix also,  but Vudu provides different titles to break up the monotony Netflix sometimes provides.  A plus, guys!! Thanks!"

"2826",488818252,"Please bring back the option to “prepare order” as desired.  When we order on the app it is with the intention that the food be ready when we arrive at the restaurant, which is a huge plus.  Not being able to do that is very frustrating.  Thank you!"

"2830",489221652,"Starts out being fun and colorful for kids, but they soon question what they are seeing. We wrote in the past, pointing out a small truth. Cook Island dancers are NOT Tahitian dancers. They are Cook Islands dancers. Tahitian dancers are from Tahiti in French Polynesia, NOT the Cook Islands. We did receive a reply that this could be updated in a future app update. It wasn’t and the kids still aren’t happy. “If this is wrong what else is wrong.”"
"2831",489221652,"My Grandpa seent this app 2 me bc I was kinda into georgraphy at the time and so we luckily didn't need 2 pay. I played it for almost 2 years and really enjoyed all the features and icons. Then I kinda got sick of it and didn't get back into it for a while. Then when I started playing it again, I found it wasn't the same as before. It was exactly the same, but every 30 seconds it crashed. I don't know what caused this issue, just because I hadn't played it for a long time, but I'm sure that wasn't the problem. They probably updated it and it made it glitchy, unless I was just out of space or somepthing. Great job overall... but pls fix the bug."
"2832",489221652,"This app is not what I expected , the only way to  get interaction is to continue to make more purchases...."

"2835",489321253,"Most awesome thing ever"
"2836",489479624,"I bought this app specifically because it said it was an iphone and watch app but it is not actually available on apple watch. It’s a fine game, not particularly fun, and definitely not worth paying for."
"2837",489479624,"As a caretaker of 3 Hatchis in this game, I have been willing to write a review on how good this app is.  Very educational; teaches kids how to care for a real pet. You feed, entertain, clean, and help your Hatchi in times is sickness. This all can be done for pets in the real world.  Also fun and addicting for everyone in general. Several games are included with a bonus game that consists of 10  levels. Games are simple, yet addicting. Some include Tic-Tac-Toe, Memory Matching, and Whack-A-Hatchi.  This game is triumphant, and I look forward to the bright future of this game."

"2839",489833171,"App is terrible does not work"
"2840",489833171,"A fun app for pics"
"2841",489833171,"Great app however would love the ability to create a personal library in order to save my work or save my favourites"
"2842",490077681,"I never leave reviews but I feel like ppl need it just like I did. I got a monitor for a gift but it was too close in my home and kept giving me the screeching sound. I also wanted something that was on my phone for mobility purposes. I haven’t found a monitor that I like yet and good thing because this app is perfectly what we needed. So don’t waste big bucks getting a monitor until your baby is active and you need different views. I put my iPad in the crib and I’m less anxious knowing I can see her every move!"
"2843",490077681,"We love to travel, and having this app has really helped us while away from home. It's so nice to have peace of mind that the kids are sleeping and safe right from our phones!   Letsgoadventuring.co"
"2844",490077681,"Title pretty much says it"
"2845",490109661,"No issues with starting on my iPad (iOS 9.1).  I can't wait to play this game with the love of my life!"
"2846",490109661,"Got hooked by the concept, game crashes no matter what i do, look at reviews to find everyone has same exact problem and a few people with fake reviews... Honestly this is just a scam to steal our money at this point. App developers not even testing their app to see if it works and making fake reviews to make it show as featured"

"2848",490152130,"I can’t get past the tutorial. This is my 3rd complaint with zero support. I am on an iPad Air2."
"2849",490152130,"Great map and overall concept, but the execution and factory testing is somewhat lacking. Some of the event cards don’t work. Example, I chose a disaster event card, the interface then told me to select a province to apply the disaster to (it even highlighted the eligible provinces), but when I clicked on a province nothing happened. I clicked everywhere on the map, nothing happened. Now I am stuck in the event card transaction with no way to get out of it except close the app and start a whole new game. Very frustrating."

"2853",490217893,"The text size in this app is ridiculously small. Font size of 2?!?!?!  I have to use the magnifier to read it. Why does an Apple controlled app not adjust text size based on  Larger Text in Accessibility."

"2865",491594445,"This game has not changed for 2 years! They have not made any new updates for 2 years! A all bronze team can beat a all gold team!  When I first played I got matched to people that are 10x better then me and I beat them. I do not recommend this game all they want is money. Like in Fortnite they add a update every week when in Big win has not added any update in 2 years!!! Your game has 1 out of 10 rules in real baseball. NOTHING IN THIS GAME IS REALISTIC. That is why you have trash reviews. IT  ALSO SAYS NUMBER 1 BASKETBALL GAME ON MOBILE, WHAT HAPPENED TO 2K AND NBA LIVE!!! THEY SHOULD JUST DELETE THIS GAME OFF THE APP STORE UNLESS THEY UPDATE THE GAME  LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY"
"2866",491730359,"First, the 2:30 minutes of ads for every 5-7 minutes of showtime discourages me from watching your programming.

"2868",491730359,"Emphasis on the but here, when I first downloaded it I think it was ( 4-5months ago) AND IT WAS AMAZING!!! It was like watching a video on YouTube, but then I deleted it (don’t ask), and so I download it again and come to find that it is completely different (totally fine) BUT (and this is where the whole thing changes so watch out) IT TURNS OUT TO BE GARBAGE!!!! I have Roku and the CW is on their and that’s where I got the inspiration to download (and then delete it) and download it again. It’s just better to pay for Netflix then to watch it on here or on Apple TV (yes this is on an iPhone) pleeeaase fix it and I’m not gonna “bribe” you with “another star” but please, the older ways were wonderful pls change (and I might give you another star)"
"2869",491899548,"I thought this would be boring but It was pretty addicting. I wish the matches were a tiny, tiny bit shorter though. And I think they celebrate too long after they score a goal. But I still really liked it."
"2870",491899548,"Feel like nothing to do except watch"
"2871",491899548,"Great Game!"
"2872",491907493,"The echo phrases and exercises need to have a count in in order to do them correctly.  The echo needs to be immediately after the playing, which is nearly impossible to do.  Fix that and this will be great."
"2873",491907493,"I downloaded the ap yesterday and used it throughout the day of teaching Grade 1-5 students. Each student responded positively. Several parents said they would immediately order this ap for their children to use at home."
"2874",491907493,NA
"2875",491998279,"Since downloading this app I have used it daily for articulation therapy at my school.  Gone are the days of pulling out different decks of cards, sorting them into initial/medial/final positions and finding their match for all the different students I work with throughout my day; all I have to do is go to one compact device (my iPad) and use this app that has it all and more!   To have all sounds available in all positions of words at the word, carrier phrase, sentence, and reading levels helps manage my office of clutter and simplifies the work space for the students. I am hoping the developers will add the phonemic /r/ sounds (ar, air, ire, or, er) in all word positions to be targeted at the word, carrier phrase, sentence, and reading levels as well.  But, the app does allow the user to add your own pictures for target words individualized to the student(s) so I could create my own phonemic /r/ lists/pictures this way but for now I don’t have the time and I’ll keep my fingers crossed they get to it first!    The app allows to easily create groups with each student focusing on their own sound(s) in various position(s) and level(s) to individualize each student’s needs to work on their own goals at their own pace.    One of my favorite features is the audio record and playback feature.  It has already proven effective with my students who typically have difficulty with self-monitoring skills.  My students are recognizing hearing themselves say the words incorrectly and are now self-monitoring their sounds better!    Lastly, not only does the app have articulation targets but they also have all of the phonological processes to target at the word level as well.  I am hoping levels for the carrier phrase and sentence levels for each to become available for students working through increasing the complexity of their speech while targeting phonological processes as well."
"2876",491998279,"I purchased this app to help my daughter with her speech during a time when our insurance did not cover speech therapy. The app is excellent! It is very user friendly and my daughter loves doing it. I love that you can specify which sounds you can work on. I also love that you can record your child’s pronunciation. I would recommend this app to parents that want some extra practice for their child. A+++"
"2877",491998279,"This app is your 1 stop shop! It has everything you need for an engaging therapy session.  Up the ante easily with words, phrases, sentences, and stories.  Collect data in the moment and save valuable therapy time. You will love this app and wonder why you waited so long to get the full version."
"2878",492076105,"I love the app and helps me organize my family schedule and appointments. Best of all my work schedule helps too. Because you can change color"
"2879",492076105,"Always keeping me on track. Wish we could get notifications by email though"
"2880",492076105,"I manage my work, school and personal schedule with this app. I especially love the color coded feature .. it gives a great visual of what is planned for the day, week, and month.   The one thing this app is missing is a share feature. I would love to be able to share my quickly changing schedule with my family."
"2881",492262759,"Great for tutoring, work, or just goofing around!"
"2882",492262759,"Nice simple program. On an iPhone 4 it is difficult to do any real detail work. A Zoom function would be useful. The color picker is good, but it would be nice to be able to save a larger palette for use by the artist."

"2887",492671847,"reviews are horrid.  I don't listen --- I'll give it a whirl and holla back"
"2888",492671847,"It is so lame. Whenever you press the screen once while the app is running, it just brings you back to the home menu. I wish I could rate this app 0 stars but there is no way to do that."
"2889",492671847,"Errors, uncertain controls, ads... Worth a try perhaps but not worth keeping. 2 stars for not totally sucking."
"2890",493136154,"I use a few different apps (OmniFocus, Things) for managing lists, work tasks and projects, however Clear is my “go to” app for quickly dictating a list under a variety of topics from projects, groceries, journaling, trips, ideas, etc. I love its simple & quick interface, unlike others that are more complex, yet also helpful for different reasons. The simple joy of sliding items completed off the list in Clear feels great."
"2891",493136154,"I love this app.  It’s fast and responsive. It’s very simple to use and has a very attractive design.  It has fun sounds too.  It doesn’t have complex features like recurring tasks and scheduling.  I use another app for my more complex needs, but when I want to get things done today, I use Clear.  It’s just a cool simple “to do” app, which is exactly what I want!  You can have multiple lists, which is nice. Also, it does sync nicely between my MacBook,  iPhone and iPad.  I highly recommend it.  My past problem with Clear:   I wrote a 1 star review in January of 2017 titled “Last update 2015, not syncing.”  That’s a long time not to update an app, so I’m concerned they might stop updating the app again.  Since it wasn’t working back then, I uninstalled the app.  At the time I was very disappointed in Clear’s app developer and felt that I had wasted my money.  But wait the story has a happy ending.  Re-discovery:  Recently I was searching for a new “to do” app and I was surprised to see Clear and that it was being updated.  I immediately downloaded it and am using it daily...and loving it."
"2892",493136154,"This is by far my most used app for iPhone. I’ve been using this app as my to do app for over 4 years now. Its simply the most elegant and simple app to use. I know it’s a big task to take on for little reward but I wish the developers would rewrite the code for the Apple Watch. Having this simple powerful tool on the wrist would be a huge game changer for me."
"2893",493145008,"I used to really like this app, but the more I use it, the more difficult it is to use the app. I keep getting messages that it looks like I’m offline, when I’m absolutely online, and it’s frustrating. I paid for a whole year, and it’s worthless now. Like they got my money and it isn’t functioning now."
"2894",493145008,"So grateful that Headspace supports educators. My days are so stressful and this app has been helping me become more mindful, and take the time I need for myself. Great intro course. The graphics are beautiful, and it’s very easy to navigate!"
"2895",493145008,"Worth the money. Audio has trouble when using some Bluetooth speakers, but it’s an acceptable annoyance when considering how great the app is overall. Went from occasionally meditating for 5-10mins a couple times a week to an active 7 days a week for 20mins."
"2896",493226494,"I used to use this app when it was free it was fun but i have to get premium to use the once free app its BS"
"2897",493226494,"Next time, when you offer a F R E E app, make sure it’s exactly that. F R E E. This force pay crap is ridiculous."
"2898",493226494,"Well I don’t know how the game works but I thought it was going to be free and some parts need to be paid for.I’m not going to pay that much money for a music app.I don’t think this is a mistake that only I made,but I got kinda sad because I was really looking forward to the app.But I’m almost certain that the app is REALLY good to charge so much money."
"2899",493536432,"App will not be compatible with future versions of iOS. Is it possible you can update the app?"
"2900",493536432,"Probably will not work on iOS 11 or future hardware."
"2901",493536432,"This game is very polished in terms of presentation - graphics, sound, guidance, mood.  The concept itself is largely mundane. Some levels are mildly amusing, many are simple exercises in chaos, chance, and opportunity.  I played through 30 levels or so which was more than enough.

"2902",493849232,"All those trucks are really amazing but can you add more vehicles to the game please otherwise it’s a really good game I love it"
"2903",493849232,"Y’all need more equipment and better quality need variety of trucks & trailers more semi trucks bigger dozers and cranes more maps a run way with one little jet and new boats every thing that is on the game already is great but it’s a little old need update very very soon before more and more people stop playing it"
"2904",493849232,"Well I love the game but we need a new update with new machines like a motor-grader, more semis and skid steers!!!"
"2905",493912733,"Amazing App!!"
"2906",493912733,"Adrian, your app has inspired me to get back into the fitness I love to do daily every week, including working on my abdominals!!  I cannot wait to see my results in a few short weeks after Week 8!  Thank you for creating this app for not just me, but for the fellow people of this world to try and use.  You’re a wonderful instructor!!!💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼"
"2907",493912733,"Hi Adrian  It's really cool one beyond cuz make me to workout after a really really long time , glad to meet it and thanks to you , I'm also in week 4 of challenge I am working on it."
"2908",494302506,"It’s a waste of money I bought this game so I can play a board game I like online but I can’t find an online game idk if it’s Bc no one plays it or if it’s a bug but if your buying this to play with real people dont buy it 😢I want my money back"
"2909",494302506,"The game, and the implementation, is fine. However, the best, BEST part of playing Scotland Yard is always the after-game, when you all burst out talking about how close you were back on move 20, where were you, oh my gosh I thought you had me, etc.  I'm surprised that zero thought was put into this critical part of the experience. You can't even look at the board after the game ends and they tell you Mr. X's final position. It just exits out and is lost forever.  Devs, if you are reading, I highly suggest you implement the ability to recap - you already have the turn counter at the bottom of the board. After a game ends, please let players tap on each turn marker and see where the pawns were at that point. It seems like that would be easy."
"2910",494302506,"I stumbled on this older game and gave it a try.  Enjoyed the simple rapid play against the AI, and wanted to try against friends and family on separate devices.  No can do.  When you select Bluetooth (which should also have a Wi-Fi option), it says to first select the number of players and then press “Connect”.  But there are no buttons to select the number of players.  If I go ahead and just press Connect it spins looking for a device, but it never finds one - even though a Bluetooth iPad was just a couple feet away.  OK...I then tried the Internet option.  Selected the name of a Game Center friend to play 2 player game with.  Their device was on and open in my house.  Again it just spun and never connected.  I suspect that since they used Game Center for the connection, they may not have kept up with the protocol for the new Game Center...or maybe this method cannot even be used anymore.  Too bad...hope they fix it.  Will give 5 stars if they can, because it would be fun to play with family and friends."

"2912",494407419,"This is a cool idea but the questions repeat themselves over and over again and it gets really annoying and boring. They need variety and/or someone to put more questions in."

"2922",495077699,"I like it but it is a little boring"
"2923",495546638,"I love the style of the app. Feels like you’ve got the real instruments in your hand. So many other apps have gone to a flat style. But I really enjoy the 3D visual feel of iPhone app like this."
"2924",495546638,"In your latest update v 5.1 on Jan 9, 2018 still this app crashed and never open in iOS 10 and above in iPhone 5 and iPad, may be bug which needs to be fixed. Thanks  About one week passed, nothing changed regarding my previous review, as this app immediately crashed. Will you make forthcoming update to solve this problem. Thanks  More than 3 months passed still no response to my previous review and this app is crashed immediately after open Thanks Long time passed since previous reviews and no action was done to correct the immediate crash when trying to open this app!!!"
"2925",495546638,"I just download this application and it’s not work with me directly off when I open it ?? I used iPhone Xs Max ."

"2927",495583717,"Approximately 5-7 times a week the puzzle locks up in such a way that you can’t scatter or zoom and the background is black and can’t be changed. Otherwise, good fun."
"2928",495583717,"I have looked all over for a way to contact the developers about this app not loading, but there isn’t a way to.  This was my favorite way to relax, I would play every morning. Over the past several weeks, it would periodically freeze when loading an ad. I would need to shut down and reload the app. But for the past week, the app won’t even open. I haven’t been able to use it all week. Before these issues, it was fun, had vibrant colors and worked well."
"2929",495680460,"Love it 😍"
"2930",495680460,"Some of you really need to read the app description. There are people whining and asking for their money back because they thought it was a Toca Life game. Obviously, if you took a little more time to look at the app’s description, you would see that it wasn’t (you should know based on the title—every app in the Toca Life series has “Toca Life: ____” as the title). This is an amazing game for 2-6 year olds, and there are 8-10 year olds whining about how “stupid” and “boring” the game was. I mean, if you’re a parent and your 2-6 year old actually found it boring, that’s fine. But it annoys me that people way outside the targeted age group are giving this terrible reviews when they should’ve read the description more carefully. I’m 12, btw, and I loved to play this when I was like 4-7 :D"
"2931",495680460,"I bought this game back when it first came out (2012ish?) and it was great! But I think it needs updated because it’s rather dull now and kids are getting bored with it. It’s still a great game, but it clearly needs updated."
"2932",496177674,"Thank you to the creators of this miracle app!! I usually never write reviews but I was soo happy to find an app that can help me so much! I’m in nursing school and I have ALOT of reading to do in such a short span. I wasn’t sure how I was going to read all of those chapters, plus do my homework and go to work all at the same time. I was starting to fall behind of my readings but thanks to this app, I was able to catch up on 5 out of 9 chapters in about a day, all while managing to keep everything else in my life on track. Not only did I not have to physically read the book myself cause the app is reading for me, but I actually retain a lot more information through this. I would usually take half a day just to read one chapter due to boredom, tiredness or just busy with other stuff, so I am very excited to use this while I’m in school. Thank you so much!"
"2933",496177674,"Ok i love this app so much and means so so much to me but lately it hasnt been reading words in qoutes, so i might have something that say  (the perspetive that someone is “high,” or “low,” functioning is.....)and the app ends up reading it as  reading  it as ( the perspective that someone is   To the power of  pr to the power of functioning is......)  which becmes extremely prob,ematic for being abke to understand whzt my artcle is axtually saying"
"2934",496177674,"Very poor support! Hard to follow and use. Would not recommend this product waste of money. Again very hade to work!"
"2935",496191902,"It’s fun to play and occupies time but you cannot get the sprinter challenge. It is impossible to achieve. Very frustrating."
"2936",496191902,"I played the computer one a long time ago but now I love it on mobile I mean right now I got 9853.51 m and a whopping $16,457.00 . Now I know some of you are probably gonna complain about my review or make some remarks but if not thank you for not I guess. Anyway I got sidetracked , I like this game and thank you for making it on mobile"
"2937",496191902,"Great game but the wind stream mechanic (that you claim gives you time to avoid) has no indication of when and where it’s going to happen. And I’m tired of getting grows where I literally go 5m/s the entire time with a fully upgraded plane. It’s irritating as all can be. Make it so it takes a lesser percentage of your speed or make it so the “wind sock” I purchased actually works and appears."
"2938",496218553,"I had this game once I really just ignored it I didn’t really like it last time so I gave up on it but what would happen if I just got it back it has been awhile so I forgot what it is like"
"2939",496218553,"Some issues I have to report. The music?! I am so sorry. That’s the bad stuff. Good stuff is the letters!"
"2940",496218553,"I got this app on my mom’s phone,I was thinking that it was the app that wasn’t free,When I got the app it was boring,Then I deleted it because it was boring,PowerpuffG1,"
"2941",496438671,"This is one of my favorite games. Perhaps u could add a freshwater spot. Also, make this game more realistic (jumping fish, better graphics, bait instead of lures, etc.). Also, the day I wrote this review, I caught a lot of fish, including Red Snapper, Red and Gag Grouper, a Mangrove Snapper, and even an octopus! Fishing’s my favorite sport, by the way. And one more thing, please decrease line tension to make the game more realistic."
"2942",496438671,"Developers,,,imagine if you could develop a game you could be proud of instead of a slot machine disguised as a game....  This free2play Is a cancer to all gamers and makes developers  No different then telemarketers... 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑"
"2943",496438671,"Horrible"
"2944",496499395,"I bought the premium thinking that I could actually play two player on WiFi but instead no matter what I do it will not connect and I wasted my money spending it on this app. Fix this or take the app of the store because it’s just a scam as of now."
"2945",496499395,"I bought it and could only play with me after t didn’t find a partner"
"2946",496499395,"The feature that you paid for to play with other players doesn’t work. App developers need to fix it or credit people their money back."
"2947",497595276,"I like it BUT it disconnects from server ALOT!!! Every 5 minutes"
"2948",497595276,"This is such a fun game!"
"2949",497595276,"Amazing game.... but.... I would like to be able to turn the buildings all the way around.... it’ll be nice... ( oh and a plus! They saved my progress from like years ago... THANK! :D)"
"2950",497716362,"Like the camera, tuners as a separate gadget are now obsolete.   TE is very easy to use, and has incredible flexibility regarding tuning systems, how narrow a band you want to consider in tune.  The metronome also works great.   The APP can also generate a drone for practicing, and has a wealth of other features for advanced users."
"2951",497716362,"I think this is good but I think it's out of tune because I play the notes correctly but it says I'm playing like an A flat when I'm playing a G flat"
"2952",497716362,"Tonal energy is an extremely useful tool for anyone studying music. It has multiple settings for tuning. It can transpose for you in any key or based on the instrument. It has specific settings for accurate tuning for voice, wind or string instruments. It has a drone feature where it will match the exact pitch you are trying to play. It also has a metronome with precision and subdivision. It’s very user friendly. I’ve had it for less than two weeks, and it has my highest recommendation."
"2953",497788271,"Got this game thinking that it would be like like Tetris for the NES but it was disappointing."
"2954",497788271,"I can’t through a game without it crashing...sad this was my favorite game."
"2955",497788271,"Overall awesome Teri’s. It every time I get to level 9 the game shuts down.  Every single time.  Fix his please."
"2956",497880658,"Amazing app granted and beloved by the sneaker community which is why I definitely paid for it but annoying big issue on some notifications that keeps popping up for just one notification, basically repeating itself so many times literally had the same exact notification around 18-20 times and screenshot it for their records"
"2957",497880658,"The best sneaker app ever I have copped 90% of my collection thanks to J23"
"2958",497880658,"Missing the restock updates. Not getting the notifications but news page is getting updates. If i need to open the app all the time to see updates then whats the point!  Update- this app is waste of money!. Never sends notifications. Whats the point of having an app which i need to open constantly to see the updates. Wish i could give zero star!!!"
"2959",497933996,"I’ve been playing this game for years and it still is so much fun, but I would really enjoy it more with my new phone if it offered support for it. Please!!"
"2960",497933996,"I love this game but don’t try to use it to relax. They also make another bird shooting pumpkin game but I can’t find it in this App Store sadly enough."
"2961",497933996,"Always fun!"
"2962",497936366,"Yup. You read that correctly. It’s what I feel when toppling these ridiculous knights off of their lame wooden structures, and my god, it’s amazing. I just used the magic to receive all the badges on Level 1 and it was glorious. Catapult King should be an animated cartoon. That’s how good it is. Plus, you can try different angles to demolish their structures for fun."
"2963",497936366,"I bought this game several years ago and played through all of the levels. Every so often I come back to it and play through again. Amazing art work with so much detail. The physics engine is effective and comically rewarding as you watch those obnoxious little knights fly, flip and topple over. Great fun!"
"2964",497936366,"I like your game"
"2965",498425561,"🙂"
"2966",498425561,"ALON Dictaphone can be sum up in one one to me “Awesome”."

"2968",499289888,"Too slow between throws. Should be able to “tap” to get to next frame quickly."
"2969",499289888,"First of all this game outstanding for its graphics and the fact you can customize your pins and ball and you could create an account and vs people in bowling! I am speechless 😶"
"2970",499289888,"Very enjoyable app, with the possible exception of my not being able to figure out how to make the infamous 7-10 split, which I did once in real ten pins in the 50 years I’ve been a bowler. One programming request here?  The next time you revise or update the app, how about considering incorporating a circle around the first number in the frame, like its done in actual bowling score keeping?  The game does incorporate lots of sloppy strikes when you put a spin on the ball and you’re near the pocket, which is also very realistic. Great game y’all, my second favorite game app, the first being classic hearts."
"2971",499470113,"...shows up as a location in my iPad’s “files” app, and allows drag & drop between an attached thumb drive and ftp server."
"2972",499470113,"I’ve been using FileExplorer Pro for more than a year, and I’m very happy with it. It plays 95% of my videos.  There are a couple that jerk too much to watch.  The interface is clean and simple.  I very much like the feature that allows deleting or renaming videos while browsing the file list.  I appreciate that they implemented one of my suggestions in the latest version."
"2973",499470113,"I painstaking moved all my files into this app because it has a password protection feature. However, I opened the files app native to iOS and found that I could see all the files in this app within the iOS files app. I could zoom in on the files view and read info on the first pdf pages. I thought that was all but, to my horror, I was able to completely open all the files on the app if I tapped on them and then tapped on the bottom of the screen after the blank page came up. I ONLY got this app for the password feature which is totally defeated with the files app. Also, you might think “I’ll just delete the iOS files app. Well it is easily re-downloaded and reintegrated with FileExplorer by anyone who has access to your phone. This is even if you log out of iTunes."

I tried another card 2 more times until it said I couldn’t run it and the seats were released. I had to start over with the whole selection but this time same seats were now 148.00!?!?! Not sure what happened because both cards were charged but immediately given a credit back. Ridiculous...."

"2976",500003565,"You can’t sell or transfer tickets in app and the only way to get into the event is to use this app. It even says “screenshots are not valid”. Bogus."
"2977",500098096,"I’ve never been a fan of touch controls, but the devs have made this game very accessible. There are some parts where the controls will be clunky and may waste a turn for you, and the “continue: Okay/cancel “ was super confusing at first so I dropped a star. Otherwise the game is fantastic and worth buying."
"2978",500098096,"Porting this to touch screen has made the game incredibly clumsy to play, and has even made some ‘tactics’ impossible.   Also, it’ll just crash out of the blue, which is suuuuuper frustrating when you’re in the middle of a long battle, or have just finished customizing some of your characters.  I love this game, and it brings back so many good memories, but this is driving me nuts, and I’m regretting paying for it."
"2979",500098096,"On the new iPad Air 3 the screen is stretched in heights so everything’s off...."

THIS APP IS UNSTABLE!!!!!!. $30!?!?!!!, wow is right.   For $30, at least give us the ability to format a document as two columns, show actual document borders or preview PDF so we can know how lyrics will look before printing, exporting, switching apps, then viewing exported file. This export workflow feels clunky.   Also have a presentation mode so that we can just view lyrics and not have menus taking up space.   Also, please give us the ability to save styles and apply them right on a working document without having to go to a song that is already formatted, then having to apply formatting from there. This seems counter-intuitive.  App appears dated, visually. Very pricey app for having it missing really essential functions. How long before an update?  Still no timeframe."
"2993",502344938,"I really need RTL support in the songs. I bought this expensive app and its absolutely no good to me. Please add Rtl support as soon as possible."

Very easy to use, you can take a picture of each item you're selling and show the price along with it. There's really no need to even carry around the paper order form, especially when it there's usually not enough room to record the necessary information anyway (customer's full name, address, etc.). App keep a running total of each item sold, how many in each category sold, can send receipt emails to customers. Can't say enough about this wonderful, helpful app that has made a usually onerous task so much easier!"

So, to the developers, I must say: your YouTube promotion efforts are working. :P"

This app not only makes an extremely obtuse and non intuitive topic accessible, it also manages to make it enjoyable and...dare I say it: FUN !   I have shared this app with my nephews and nieces AND their children (some as young as 5 years old) and it has always elicited excitement, curiosity and many, many questions. It will be interesting to see how their very early exposure to easily accessible and yet extremely abstract concepts affects their abilities to process and assimilate abstract and obtuse ideas going forward (or, in this instance, rotating outward and folding up...).  I do, however, have one suggestion...although the two pages where you ‘hack’ the optic chiasma (meld two images into a “3-D” facsimile) work fine on my iPhone and my iPad Mini they don’t do well on standard sized iPads. My arms, and I’m 6’4” tall, are too short to hold the screen far enough away to fix and hold the images in place while manipulating the conjoined image. If you were to make an iPad-friendly version of those two pages, one in which they are just a little bit closer together, it would vastly improve the experience."

"3035",504835984,"Had been feeling totally out of control with food! For a few years now I’ve been gaining weight and every week vowed that “this would be the day I start my diet.” Each time it was a failure and I kept saying tomorrow. Like an addict I had reached my bottom and was searching for anything that could help. I came across this app VGB and decided to give it a try. Almost immediately I noticed changes in my eating...smaller bites, really tasting my food and craving fruit!! This Is my 4th week and I’m down 15 lbs!!! I am a true believer. I love this program and how easy it’s been. If you want to lose weight or are feeling out of control with food please give this program a try!"
"3036",504835984,"I came across easyloss purely by accident, but after reading all of the reviews I could find...decided I had to dl it.  As someone who has been on pretty much every type of diet there is out there, this is a breath of fresh air because it ISNT a diet.  It gives you so much hope (and results!); you don't have to change your entire life to fit the confines of the latest fad diet...you just follow the guidelines.  The guidelines teach you to listen to your own body, and eat intuitively.  I honestly haven't changed what I'm eating at all, though I now don't have binge sessions, so I'm actually eating a lot less without any feelings of hunger or deprivation.  It's so simple, and yet our own  ability to eat intuitively has basically been programmed out of us!    The hypnosis sessions help to support your own resolve, and they really are great.  I've been able to lose 12lbs in 4 weeks...which is huge because usually I'll drop like 10lbs in 2 weeks on a proper ""diet"" and then fall off in some way (large or small) because I'm ravenous and cranky.  Because this isn't a diet, and you aren't restricting yourself, you don't get those feelings and it's so much easier to push on.  Instead of a big drop on the scale (water weight), my weight goes down a little bit on most days for a nice cumulative downward movement on the scale.  It's amazing!    I will say that when you read the guidelines you may think..""this is it?"" ...well, yes, that IS it!  And then you'll realize as you continue eating, knowing the guidelines, just how much you've been overdoing it.  Eating just because it's x-o'clock and everyone else wants to eat, or eating a massive serving of food just because it's on your plate and then wanting to unbutton your pants or something crazy.  Try this, it works.  And it will give you your life back when it comes to food.  No more obsessive tracking or controlling the macro content of your meals, etc.  just eating how we were designed to eat...with these lovely folks helping you along the way with the hypnosis sessions and Facebook group."

The monster ate the smoothie ( because you can’t drink it cause it isn’t a drink for some reason) and spit it in my face 😤. How rude! I like this app because it has a lot of combinations but I think you need more ways of cooking the food in the app and maybe some more types of food.

"3100",510461370,"Update 5: It is the worst when a great game is created by a terrible company. This game hasn't been updated in 8 months and is falling apart... server crashes, load times, ugh. Not to mention, it isn't a fair play game. Despite buying the game, it is dominated by those who pay more for turbo bikes. Im at a stall at level 4 because they often only do a single 4 star race per day and it is open bike meaning it gets dominated by paid for turbo bikes. They could easily add more 4-star bike specific races so it is talent, not money that wins...    Update 4: I really want to remove a star, but I will keep it at two because they did start releasing more “kickass” bike parts which is the only way to upgrade from level 2 to 3. The reason for the update is Duel is now completely broken. Before it had issues matching with 1 out of 5 attempts working, which is still the problem, but now, when a race is finished, it doesn’t connect to server so just deletes the race... super frustrating especially because challenges are duels.  Update 3: I just upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars because they started adding more of the bike that upgrades level 2 bikes to level 3 bikes... after months of being stalled, I get to progress again 😀 However, connectivity issues are seeming to get worse. Duel only matches ever 4th or 5th attempt and matchups tend to be very imbalanced. Also Tourneys often get server down issues... it seems the game is getting more popular, but their servers cant handle it.  Update 2: now tournaments is failing to record some of my times so I come in last. Either the game has developed serious bugs or <enter conspiracy theory here>. I did get a response from support who invited me to delete the game... are you kidding me?!? 😡  Update 1: now game has serious server issues with regular connection issues and duel matching just completely fell off. I will be happy when another company takes this concept and builds a better game. —  Original: First off, this is an incredible game. Ive even built my own tracks online... here is the MAJOR problem that makes it soooo frustrating. First, I paid for the game, yet players can still spend more to get a bike that is unbeatable... learn from other games, let spending be vanity not performance... people lose interest after buying anyways because there is no more challenge. Next and probably the worst is you can get all first level bikes in a couple hours, second level bikes in a couple days, but 3rd level bike near impossible (been playing everyday for months) because they hold back the one bike needed to upgrade any level 2 bikes so all progress completely halts and all rewards in tourneys become useless... DONT PREVENT PROGRESS DUMB DUMBS, again monetize on vanity or secret unlocks, not performance or progress, you wreck the game. Finally, to make it even harder to unlock their rare-as-a-diamond-in-the-butt-crack-of-an-elephant bike is the fact that higher level bikes can compete in lower level races... this means the entire progress bar skews to the already haves instead of leveling the field... not very smart. I have written the devs regarding this issue but crickets..."
"3101",510461370,"I’m sorry but as fun as this game is to play, they NEED to get new levels put in this game. Also is is insane how long it takes to level up to a bike that has 4 or 5 stars? And now with the VIP like What the heck that’s too expensive. NEED MORE LEVELS and where are the user designed levels there are never any there anymore!!"
"3102",510461370,"Well, I think this game is really great as far as mechanics level design and bike options etc. Multiplayer is a great touch as well. I even like pd it so much I got BikeRacePro pro. However this all changed with the introduction of bikerace VIP. For me personally 100$ is way to much even for a paid app. I find it very bothersome that I’m no longer able to use any other bikes but the default one. This wasn’t always the case. I almost had all bikes unlocked except the few ones that were only paid. Which I was fine with. But for me a reason I liked playing was completing the challenges that were needed to unlock the next bike in the line. And I don’t know how often review are read and if at least some changes will be made but in all the years of having had this app it would be wonderful to be able to unlock some bikes.   -Thank you."

"3109",510855668,"Overall this app works great and has a great selection of music available. There are a few technical glitches that are annoying to deal with sometimes.

"3137",514345557,"The app is so great I love designing and I love how you can build rooms and add windows and doors and my most favorite is decorating the home after I am done building it thank you for whoever made home design."
"3138",514345557,"This app is really great for visualizing how various arrangements will look in a room or house.  It is a little too tedious to end up with exact dimensions on a room, but to see how things would look in general is easily accomplished and fun."

"3152",515840296,"As with other games from this developer, this game is well designed and executed. The art and music are beautiful, and the puzzles are fun. Overall the game isn’t as challenging as it could be and I was able to breeze through it in an hour or so, but it was still enjoyable."

"3164",516875543,"I would have to agree with HDEMO. This game is so very frustrating!!!!!! Add a few seconds to the time so you can complete the level with at-least one star!!!!!   I guess if it was easy it would not be a challenge. But really.  Nicely made tho.   Bassfreak"
"3165",516875543,"Listen, your game is great. I love the gameplay and the controls are easy and simple. Yet, I hate this game more than any other in the whole wide world! Why? Because some of the levels are so demanding and are almost impossible. I’m not saying you should change the entire game, but certain levels should be given a few more seconds for all 3 stars. Nonetheless, I think it is a great game. Still, somehow this game is more frustrating than “getting over it”."
"3166",517260318,"Another Update: Why do I bother🙄 You’ve rigged the game..made it incredibly stressful..not relaxing and enjoyable. I’ve given you time to change things and you choose not to so I want to warn others and let you know how unenjoyable you have made one of my favorite games. This bad review is on you. I don’t want to try anymore. UPDATE: I reloaded this game and I’m regretting it already. IF you would make it to where you can turn OFF the timer I could enjoy your games..please make it possible. Also. I would love to give this 5 stars except for the fact that I notice how you have “fixed” the game and you deliberately make it stressful and pretty much unwinable. Too many examples to cite here. I don’t want to delete it but I’m not enjoying the stress, especially when you change the board to make sure that I don’t have a match.  I love the butterfly game....but it's not fair or fun to have the spider grab your butterfly if there is still a play going...xplosions all over the place..and your ""stratigic"" move is wasted when the spider takes a butterfly DURING a play. I am not a sore loser...I have scored many games near the 750,000- 2 million points. It would also be good to have something saved to help blast your way out when you are in real danger. I do love the game tho...and always hate spiders!"
"3167",517260318,"The game is okay with one huge exception.  It will constantly bother you with ads after each team regardless whether you turn the ad setting off.  In addition it will constantly encourage you to spend real money just to continue playing the game with more benefits.  I strongly recommend that everyone try to avoid this game and give it a poor rating so that these companies who create these things will get the idea or we don't want ads on the games we purchase."
"3168",517260318,"Purchased copy is suddenly full of ads. Small ad box constant on the lower left of the screen. Extra time requires watching a video ad. Ads between games. Game used to be fun but the sudden and offensive changes ruined it. Easy fix, of course: game deleted."
"3169",517271093,"The Opponent team always get a free 15 when I go into Ad is so annoying can you please fix your game or can you please make us turn off our Wi-Fi and make us have no ads😡😡😡😡😡😡"

"3171",517271093,"This is a great game, considering the speed, graphics and playability being on an iPad. It also has Bluetooth multiplayer which is great but me and my son haven’t managed to complete a full match without it freezing up. Shame, as it has loads of potential. The instant replays are a bit annoying, as is the slow-mo hit which basically makes it impossible to return, but a solid 3.5/5 * for now."
"3172",517329357,"With iOS 13, the Dark Mode feature is gone unless you switch your entire iPhone over to dark mode.  Horrible!  I don’t care for Apple’s dark mode, & now I can’t use this app in dark mode independently."
"3173",517329357,"You guys should make it so there is a spot to see multiple cities at the same time or a favorite list that would be awesome you should all so make an additional spot for the Apple Watch do you have the wind in the area just like the Apple weather app does for the watch then I can delete the Apple weather app  What would be cool is if you could add wind option for the watch and UV"

"3176",517409040,"Amazing"
"3177",517409040,"Great app! Simple, intuitive and can use speech also. It doesn’t get 5 stars only because it needs internet connection to work."

"3179",517642765,"It’s a fine game but I think they mislead me and wasn’t as much as the ads would make you think it is and I’d like more updates but generally a good game update it more."
"3180",517642765,"This looked like a good game, at first. I had previously bought the second game, and as that one was so good, I decided to buy the dirt game because, well, more weapons. There are some pretty major problems with it. First off, I can never get the light to work properly. If I turn on the flash option in the main settings and hit save, it doesn’t. It immediately removes anything that I have chosen. It also doesn’t work if I go into the gun settings. The only way for me to get it to work is to refresh the app with each new gun that I choose, which gets annoying. My second issue is that the bomb that you can put a timer on (which is a great concept, by the way. We need more bombs!) sometimes just freezes. It counts down, and then randomly just stops. No explosions, no beeping sound of the counter. Nothing. Very frustrating. If this can get fixed, I’ll change my rating, but this game was last updated three years ago so... anyways, I want my money back. This was not worth it at all. If there’s potential customers reading this, just get the second game, don’t waste your money!"
"3181",517685886,"Challenging and addictive, even though I’m still playing on the lower levels. I’ve never played the actual board game, so I can’t say how well it translates. But I’m enjoying this version."
"3182",517685886,"We just bought the $3.99 upgrade to get the special buildings. At least one of the special buildings didn’t work properly and it ruined this round. The trafficking spot special card did not allow you to trade upgraded goods, even though that was part of its description. There was only the option to trade standard goods.  Otherwise love the game and the app is excellent!"
"3183",517685886,"Excellent app. Been playing Le Havre on here for years. I’m so glad that the developer has kept it alive. Thrilled that they’ve added Le Grand Hameau."
"3184",517812925,"Every time I delete it I want to download it again but for creative can you add something to level up your pets to try them out and see what they will look after leveled up"
"3185",517812925,"This game has always been my favorite, but it’s had a little downtime lately, It hasn’t been updated for almost 2 years and it has some big and weird glitches that made me delete this game and get the free version. First of all the anvil has problems. If you put hammers and broken equipment in it it won’t repair them and instead cause them to disappear. Next, sometimes if you drop pets, a sign will come up on the screen. Whatever you press, YES, or NO it will disappear instead of being on the ground or being in the inventory. I hope you developers read this and fix these ASAP. The free version of Block Story doesn’t have these problems, so I’m playing the free version until these get fixed. Don’t trust me? Other people are reporting the exact Same problems."
"3186",517812925,"It’s an overall good game but the achievements don’t actually work. They don’t give you a reward. There’s also a lot of rendering glitches."

"3188",517871755,"meh. It was ok at first, but... just try to save a photo and you are bombarded with confusing popup ads! It’s purposely confusing how to “escape” the ad and get back to the ad. Then... it incentives you to “unlock all features” by watching a video. Now, I’m used to games doing this, but a utility? Keep in mind this happened in under 2 minutes of first opening the app!"

"3190",517989834,"I really love this app. You can do so much with your photos. I especially like the cartoon filter. I just wish they would make an update for the new Apple 12 operating system. Right now I can only use it on my older iPad that hasn't been updated."

I will be deleting this TOTALLY NOT REWARDING GAME but wanted to post this review first, to warns others not to wast their time.  Items earned are not a reward for successful play if they just collect in inventory and cannot be used.  Plus, the amount of energy required to search a place, when compared to the useless items and the excessive time (or $$) needed to restore energy is just nothing but another layer of frustration.

I guarantee most of the players are kids and not all kids have money and my parent personally aren’t gonna buy these levels so I’m stuck playing like 5 levels and then deleting the game.

It appears that for some purchases (specifically Amazon) the approval takes exceedingly long with the transaction remaining in ‘pending’ status even behind the 45 day redemption period.

"3232",521577043,"This is a very comprehensive App and the learning curve is quite bumpy at the beginning because some of the features are not user friendly at all. You will have to devote some time to learn if you want to get the most of it.   This App has one major flaw, entering a new wine is a very complicated and time consuming thing. You cannot scan the wine front label nor the bar code like Vivino does. That leaves you with the only option to use the search option to find the wine that you want to add. The search icon to access the database to find your wine is on the top right and not in the main data entry area. When you start entering your wine most of the options that come up don’t have the correct harvest year of your wine specially if it is an international wine or if it is a recent harvest from 2016-2018. You have no other option to select the closest option and then change the year manually.   Furthermore you have to manually take picture of  the label of your wine bottles, because the database does not include a picture. The App allows you to enter up to 3 pictures but you have to take those pictures manually to each bottle during the adding wine process. The other day it took me almost an hour to enter into the App a full case of 12 bottles, after navigating to find the correct year of my wines and taking manual pictures of all my wines.   Adding the option of scanning the wine label or the bar code to quickly locate your wine like Vivino does is an absolute must. If they don’t do it the App is too much time consuming and will require a lot of time to perform the most basic thing which is adding a new wine."
"3233",521577043,"It’s a great app overall, but I was very disappointed on the lack of information for the different Champagne sub regions. Also, wines like champagne don’t usually come from a single year, so it would be useful to have the option of introducing ranges, including a separate year for the dégorgement."

"3239",521640355,"I’ve had this game since I was three and I’m seven this game is super duper fine if you want to learn how to drive a train but please fix the sound affects there’s a train it affects so please fix The game and my brother love this game but he really wants it to have trained fracture so please make a train sounds if you don’t want train sounds by this game but if you do do not buy this game👊"
"3240",521640355,"So i like this game and its pretty entertaining to my sister and brother and I really like them being happy, one issue that we have is occasionally we will pull up to a train station and there will be no one there this then makes the game crash. This is most likely due to a bug in the code which makes the player model not appear as it should. Just wish toca would put more time in to there games. I payed 2 bucks for this and you guys don’t even update it. Smh."
"3241",521640648,"Hit the home button accidentally and the whole app closes and starts over. Works really great for kids who are working on self regulation"
"3242",521640648,"When I put the rainbow-colored raindrop harp thing on the star, I strum hard and the drops just stay there. And when I put another person on the stage, it doesn’t move and I see black pixelated stuff on them."
"3243",521640648,"I PLAYED IT SENCE I WAS 2 AND NOW IM 7 AND STILL PLAYING IT.  ITS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!"
"3244",521671873,"hello"
"3245",521671873,"I really like this game, except for the fact that the castle does not have enough beds for one of each monster. I worked hard to get them and would like to display one of each."
"3246",521671873,"I gave it a 5 but the thing is I completed a free diamond offer and I still haven’t gotten it so it wasted my time doing it for nothing"
"3247",521922264,"My daughter got married over a year ago and some of the photos of her and family were taken in front of a dingy gray wall and a stain on the carpet. This app has made the photos worth printing now."
"3248",521922264,"This is great app thanks...."
"3249",521922264,"My kids use it...but I thought hhhhhmmm ..then I remembered... so downloaded and now I’m having Funtime using this apps...nice and easy🥳🥳🥳💝"
"3250",522008611,"Great app!"
"3251",522008611,"I've been using this app every day for 3+ years. It's been amazing! A++"
"3252",522008611,"I like this app. The reporting tab is a little clunky, but overall this app makes my life much easier."
"3253",522029577,"Great Best RPG"
"3254",522029577,"I like the game and have even spent real money from time to time. The grind gets real tho. Would be nice to have an auto fight option so your characters track enemies and use abilities(wisely, not just whenever it's available) would add another layer of strategy to the game."
"3255",522029577,"Almost all the strategy of Plague Inc. minus the all-or-nothing irritation of blowing an hour on a lost round.  All I ask is a disperse button to move your clustered characters apart from each other when you need to issue crucial commands.  Update: I hate cheesy ad-supported game schemes.  Nothing here.  Love being able to reinstall and catch up fast.  Super-deep skill trees for a brawler.  Love it!  Aug 18 update: had to delete it after 85% of fights after 20+ hours started crashing on iPhone 6.  Seriously bummed out because this game is one of the deepest brawlers I've played."
"3256",522408559,"Now come on with the update I spend to much on playing this game update please thanks"
"3257",522408559,"This app rocks! I rake in awesome payouts!"
"3258",522408559,"I love this game.  Been playing it for years.  I just wish the bonus came sooner than every 4 hours."
"3259",522626820,"No Apple Watch support"
"3260",522626820,"Overall, fine app. I just wish that it was free!!"
"3261",522626820,"It’s simple and an easy way to learn Spanish"
"3262",522700349,"别用"
"3263",522700349,"非常好！"
"3264",522700349,"非常喜欢😘"
"3265",522826277,"Good"
"3266",522826277,"Very good interface and easy to use!"
"3267",522826277,"This app helps so much when you forget something or need a clear up and dont have time for waiting on receiving an email back from your teacher."

"3271",523403945,"It had taken a lot"
"3272",523403945,"I think I’m a HORRIBLE skin creator myself but looking at all these other skins, I can see master piece! When I look around for the skin I want I can’t find it. So when I press “New Project” and then press “from other user”, I type in a “name” like doctor or something it ALWAYS says “Alert invalid Username”. I have NO clue if this is a glitch or something else. So who ever is reading this, I would use this app at your own risk."
"3273",523403945,"Legitimately bought this to edit one of my skins, but I can't even import it because it reads every username as invalid. Cool App Seus, you really outdid yourselves."
"3274",523520711,"This is a rather lovely app..I’m glad that I installed it. I love the cute designs. 💕☺️"
"3275",523520711,"This is a good app but I wish you the makers of this app would add more free things there are some others that cannot afford to use the things that you offered by paying for it this would be more usable if you had a lot more features and made it free for some of us that through no fault of our own because there are other names in our lives have to pay for otherwise this would be a good app to recommend and use on a daily basis thank you For making this app available but I think you should add more free features you would get a lot more people using your app sincerely app user"
"3276",523520711,"Love it."
"3277",523540409,"Absolutely love using Nearpod lessons!"
"3278",523540409,"I just can't seem to find the add presentation button(, do not blame me, I'm 8 yrs old). The website is more convenient."
"3279",523540409,"So I was trying to do one of the old nearpods my teacher assigned to my class but once enter the code it won’t let me in saying it’s invalid. Like I get it it’s been two months since the nearpod was made but I should still have access to it NOT FAIR"
"3280",524299475,"I got the free version and you only have like 3 raps to choose from unless you want to pay $100 a year 😡"
"3281",524299475,"Ok the point I make is that sometimes VIP members can’t reply to challenges. It says my internet connection is bad however I’m on it and beside it."
"3282",524299475,"App is subpar - pricing is structured in a way that you get charged without getting a receipt due to their “weekly subscription”."
"3283",524644575,"My fav pregnancy app. I love hearing little ones heartbeat. Gives me peace of mind as well. This app has been great and very easy to use. Heard heartbeat as early as 21 weeks!"
"3284",524644575,"Don’t work and keeps charging my card won’t let me cancel"
"3285",524644575,"This does not work at all!! I have had this for a few months, I'm 34 weeks pregnant and I have never picked up a single heartbeat on this app. Very disappointed!"
"3286",524988885,"With an iPhone X you can’t access the menu. Not sure if there’s a flashlight option either because it’s very dark. I remember having a flashlight on the computer version."
"3287",524988885,"I got to the very end and put in the correct gem sequence and the correct color sequence and pressed the red button but was only left with a star pattern and not the promised view of Riven. Please provide a fix in the next update. Great game otherwise."
"3288",524988885,"Very good game, and hard puzzles so far, but the lighting is HORRIBLE at some spots. I cannot find the secret door in stone ship age because it is too dimly lit. Needs a graphic update where the game is brighter. Right now it is too hard to see."
"3289",525176875,"If this app offers to put entries into Calendar - entries such start & end times of full moon at sunrise / sunset. Such capability would allow me to better plan and set alarms appropriately.  For now, I must manually enter each full moon period into Calendar, then set alarms. Tedious task at best."
"3290",525176875,"This app has helped me tremendously finding the perfect time to photograph the Moon and Milky Way. Unbelievable amount of detailed information."
"3291",525176875,"This tool has just about everything you could ask for. Use it to plan ahead for photo/video shoots, know exactly how much time you’ll have for light, and know exactly when the moon will be in just the right spot over your nighttime subject. It even tells you when/where the Milky Way will rise and when to get the clearest shot.   I love using it while planting my garden. Now I know how many hours of sun each area will get on any given day of the year.   Only thing I could see them adding is a constellation overlay. That would blow me away."
"3292",525195399,"I know his is a Japanese game but switching to other languages would be very helpful for many people. I tried to play and learn without English and it seemed pretty fun"
"3293",525195399,"It said when I downloaded the game I could translate it to English but I can’t find out how too in the game could you please make it easier wot people who speak English to find how to switch it"
"3294",525195399,"Great game, great app... you can sort of figure it out without knowing Japanese, but English would be helpful."
"3295",525246631,"I used to play these games all the time when I was younger. The graphics are really nostalgic to me. I’m glad a few of these are still here but please pleass PLEASE bring back breakfast maker, s’mores maker, snowman maker, and all your other “maker games”, but especially breakfast maker! Please... I love that game and I wish to purchase all the items on that game. Please!!! Update: PLEASE BRING BACK ICEE ARCADE AND ICEE MAKER TOO I BEG YOU!"
"3296",525246631,"I remember when i first got this game i was like 4 or 5 it’s was one of my favorite games ever and i like forgot about it but i ran into i and i’m so happy i found this game again i hope you other people have/had a good time with this game like i did"
"3297",525246631,"I rember this game I would play it as a 5 year old and I totally forgot aboute it!! I  downloaded it again and it brings back so many memories!"
"3298",525507410,"My nephew LOVES this app and my niece is already showing interest even though it’s not potty training time for her yet :)"
"3299",525507410,"This used to be one of our favorites but then came the update...  The new update:  -removed the “just watch” option which my infant loved. Why remove?  My LO (little one) would be hypnotized they the whole thing. Now she just gets stuck and bored.  -removed fun phrases like “Elmo knows what to do”, random flushes, Elmo laughing, Star sounds and more.  -Re-recorded phrases using a seeming “drugged up” super slow Elmo. Happy Elmo was far superior! -added a female character which is blends in very poorly. It’s like someone shouting during your favorite song and ruining it. How about her own pages instead of sloppily throwing her in?  In summary, I wish so much I didn’t update. Unfortunately Apple gives no option to roll back or money back when the product is negatively changed."
"3300",525507410,"I realize it just a few dollars but it really wasn’t worth it for me. It got my son to sit on the potty to play it but there isn’t a lot to do. He got bored with it very fast."
"3301",525781368,"Respect"
"3302",525781368,"I would be good to know what kind of phones you guys who give good or bad reviews are using."
"3303",525781368,"To many ads"
"3304",525790167,"I like this program to Sce money and convenient."
"3305",525790167,"Like the app"
"3306",525790167,"Doesn’t even give you the full view"
"3307",525818572,"I first saw this and thought it would a fun thing to do while at work. Awesome concept. However, it gives inaccurate achievements. So until that is fixed, I won't use it."
"3308",525818572,"Nice improvements. Finally works right."
"3309",525818572,"Please update to make the app function properly in background. Please allow for 1.5 and 2.0 pay for overtime. I poop a lot on overtime. Great app."
"3310",525818839,"It is a fun game, but there is some room for improvement"
"3311",525818839,"I used to play plague inc. all the time, with my friends, cousins, and siblings, but then DLC’s came out, and the original game modes died, I still play it now but it changed too much."
"3312",525818839,"It took about ten tries to figure out the balance. At first I couldn't get past the cure being developed and implemented. Then I made the virus too deadly too fast and it wiped out all of my infected before contaminating the whole world. Then I figured out the timing of all of the various triggers and realized that once you win - replay is just a variation on a theme with little to maintain long term interest. Worth the price but definitely not a five star game."
"3313",525929300,"Let me start off by telling you that this game is utter perfection. The dynamics are so on and the physics is right which makes it so much fun to play. The ONLY complaint I have is when the diver is doing a type of backwards flip (reverse, back) when you switch from doing a backwards pike to a backwards somersault the guy glitches, he starts in a different position than where you left off on the previous flip and its not smooth. I know this is fixable because when you are doing a forwards dive, it works perfectly. If you could please take a look at this I will surely be buying much more from you guys! Thanks!"
"3314",525929300,"Best game I’ve ever played, super fun and interesting!! There’s only one problem, there should really be a female diver, only reason it’s not 5 stars."
"3315",525929300,"A really cool game, but I’d love the option to have a female diver, as well as a slower twist maybe."
"3316",526011730,"This game is scary I told Angela if there was something in her eyes she said r u alone and I said just 2 people and I was with my 5 friends and my phone frozen and I got a virus.I deleted it and reinstalled it and I pressed on Tom and he fell and the same things happened again it froze and got a virus.I was talking how cute ginger was and automatically ginger came out of nowhere so kids do not download this is soo scary."
"3317",526011730,"i roasted her and she came out as lesbian."
"3318",526011730,"if you say who is a idiot Angela will say a bad word and this app asks personal information and talks about sex this game should be banned"
"3319",526012271,"So like whenever you use the word who’s an idiot Angela replies in a very inappropriate language that isn’t good for kids..whoever made this game needs to change or think about this game..I got scared reading so many bad ratings and written views that Angela is a demon! She has a man near a closet near another kid in her eyes,Angela your not ok! Others may say”oh no Angela is the best game ever shes so safe” but NO she’s a killing machine I’ve played it a lot when I was little and never thought about it till now it’s time these evil talking Tom and Angela games die! Like, playing this game is kinda fun if you don’t know about the stuff but by hearing all this creepy stuff may change what you thought good about her...so uh yeah that’s all I had to say..bye   /\_/\                                             ( .  . )_______                                              |                 |///////\\\|                                              |_|—|_|—|_|"
"3320",526012271,"Once upon a time I was on the phone Angela said set a bad word I didn’t respond to it because I thought it was too inappropriate in fact my mom doesn’t even want me to say anything to Wade just quit of the game I asked my mom to delete it and she didn’t really wish you didn’t do it I wish she didn’t even download itNo I am seven and even here on the couch it is Brian do you make your son just changed it by hope you get this message"
"3321",526012271,"Fun"
"3322",526641427,"I love this game! It’s very fun, puzzling, and a time killer! Highly recommend all the flow games if you love puzzle games!"
"3323",526641427,"It’s not the best game ever, but I like it because I’m good at it.                                   Alayna L.                                     Clark"
"3324",526641427,"I have perfected every pack including the purchasable ones, and I have a 300+ daily streak with 800+ daily completed puzzles. This game is amazing. Please please please add more packs! I need more 😅"
"3325",526783584,"I’ve been using this app to edit my digital photos and also pics I talk on my phone. I like to take pictures of my family and friends children, family Pets and make them super original and creative so the pictures are original and personal to the friend or family I’m gifting them too.  This app has a ton of options, and I feel like anyone with practice can generate some pretty epic pictures!"
"3326",526783584,"Have been using this app on android and iphone since i found it in 2013 just switched back to iphone and this app freezes and doesnt close correctly when i use it :/"
"3327",526783584,"I have been using this Moble app for several years now.  Last few times, I’ve tried using the double exposure and can not see the photo I need to insert.  All I see is the crop lines.  When I check the checkmark to ok it then the phot shows up.  BUT it is not what I wanted to do.  Is anyone else having this problem."
"3328",526819635,"This is actually for the text notifications from COJ, but I had no idea how else to let them know. I’m getting alerts for flooding EVERY SINGLE DAY. It’s going to end up being The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Whyyyyyyy are so many alerts being sent??"
"3329",526819635,"The app tells you if where you are currently is an evacuation zone. You can also type in your address and it will tell you. One add I would suggest is since we have so many bridges in this city, have a bridge status telling what bridges are open or closed."
"3330",526819635,"Very helpful app, hard to identify your zone with the evacuation zone map, this is mainly due low resolution, surprisingly the search bar will let you know your zone by typing your home address."
"3331",526831380,"This app is so helpful and reliable. Use this on a daily basis. Really like severe weather notifications."
"3332",526831380,"Really a great weather advisory app"
"3333",526831380,"Thanks so much for all the updates n hard work ❤️❤️"
"3334",527173191,"Update the app so it can work with iOS 11"
"3335",527173191,"I hate your game"
"3336",527173191,"I downloaded this game to get pumped 😉 for the new game and finished it one day before Pumped 3 finally came out. It's still a great game even with the new games out. I definitely recommend playing all three games!"
"3337",527219710,"This is part of my morning routine but I’m trying to use the watch app so I won’t have to pick up my phone first thing in the morning and it’s not working. Love the app but please resolve"
"3338",527219710,"Me encanta esta aplicación, pero no tengo para pagarla me la podrían dar gratis por favor"
"3339",527219710,"I used this back when it was free and the workouts were great. Now I have to pay $15 a month to use it. I might as well go to an actual gym. Thanks for nothing guys. 😔"
"3340",527358348,"Don’t buy this game if you have an iPhone X. The bottom part of the screen is unusable, which leads to unwindable rounds"
"3341",527358348,"Bought the game and it’s awesome.  I got some coins and wanted to get the machine gun but it keeps saying I don’t have enough coins or stars. The issue is I have more than enough coins and it does not have a star lock on it.  So I restarted the app and still nothing.  I tried to redownload the app to see if that’s the issue and now all my progress and the coins I bought are now gone.  I need a resolution for this.  I tried to email them but the site is not loading. Please help"
"3342",527358348,"I can’t buy new towers with coin??? Solution?"
"3343",528122602,"Now that pretty much all iPads have support for the Apple Pencil it makes no sense that the pen input in this app is as TERRIBLE as it is.   Walking around a job site using this app with the pencil allows you to make comments and notes just as if you were carrying a full size set of drawings with you and is a lot easier that typing notes while walking around the site.   The desktop programs are amazing and I don’t know what I would do without them. I just don’t understand why they wouldn’t make the iOS app in the same fashion.   I could say I would update this review and give it full stars once the pencil support gets better but I have been waiting for improvements on this app for over a year. It doesn’t even get updated regularly."
"3344",528122602,"Completely useless app, when I go to measure the screen turns blue blocking out the floor plan in the background.  I’m asking for “my” money back."
"3345",528122602,"As a professional Architect, I have used BlueBeam for years in the office and in the field.  I liked that I could easily get files onto my iPad through the Studio feature, and I liked the ability to create tool sets on the Desktop that would transfer to the iPad app.  However, ever since Nametshek bought BlueBeam, there seems to have been a complete lack of support and development for the iPad app.  Seriously: not even a release to fix bugs in at least 11 months!  Most good apps release bug fixes every week or two.  I also see all of the instability issues that the other reviewers mention.  Whenever another Architect asks me how I use BlueBeam on the iPad, one of the first things I mention is to Save Often, because the app WILL crash on you regularly.  Unfortunately, I haven’t found a good replacement yet, but I am definitely looking.  One star for giving up on what could be a great product."

"3349",528919633,"Addendum:  The app is no longer actively maintained.  It’s kept up for posterity.  Members can interact with each other on a limited basis. I want to say “thank you” to the app devs who worked long and hard to make this app available for so many years.  This app was a big deal in many peoples childhoods. Original review: When I initially reviewed this app a few years ago, there was a huge problem with fake seeds.  There are now moderators who work to remove the fakes.  There's also now discussion forums along with seeds so the app is more interesting."
"3350",528919633,"Used to be on here back from 2012-2013, cool app for seeds and creations My username is Lordawesome23 and I have 450 followers on here, good times I had with this app"
"3351",528919633,"This app is like a dystopia. There are hardly any users and no posts are approved because the developers deserted it.The are no moderators left so the off topic section is full of inappropriate material. Used to be good, that’s why I rated three stars instead of one."

"3361",529379082,"Some of the lyft driver cars I have been in recently have been filthy.  Badly stained interiors and general messiness...  Lyft needs a new standard."
"3362",529379082,"Lyft needs to provide accessible services for persons with disabilities. I am able to use the service; it is just stressful. Since I use a manual wheelchair and am short, I cannot transfer into high cars. So, I feel it is Russian roulette whenever I request a ride."
"3363",529379082,"Good drivers  good communication while trying to connect at location  Price of fees. tues Sept 17 changed while in trip. No traffic. No reason  Not good"
"3364",529443604,"thought i’d be able to listen to audio collected over the night but i guess not lol"
"3365",529443604,"Great app but since it was updated last it crashes on launch 😓"
"3366",529443604,"App appears to have recorded activity. Shows data, graphs, etc., but no sound during play back. No app support only worthless FAQs"
"3367",529646208,"I've purchased hundreds of apps and never reviewed one, until now. This app is utterly mind blowing. Go for the full pro package with 240 pro renderings. IMHO, this app is incredibly underpriced!!  Developers, thank you so much for keeping this app updated."
"3368",529646208,"I’ve been trying to teach myself fractals with a PC program for years and have never been able to figure out how to get the beautiful images I often see.  I am so, so, so thrilled with Frax.  It makes exploring and seeing results very very easy (imo) and it is just so beautiful to look at!!!  You have one very VERY happy customer for life!"
"3369",529646208,"Normally I don't write reviews. But this app blew my mind. I love fractals. So I could play with this for hours. It does have a learning curve though."
"3370",529652920,"The game is good and addicting the only problem is there is a bug that won’t let you do fusion and I don’t know how it happened but I hope you fix it please and thank you(ps-sorry if my punctuation is bad)"

"3372",529652920,"Videos are causing the game to crash. Used to be a great game but has been getting worse."
"3373",529815782,"I’ve had this app for a while and have found the information helpful. I opened the app recently and all of the content is gone. No Calendar, no information about leaps, nothing. It is now just a 4 page ad for the Wonder Weeks book. I don’t know if the developer screwed up their update or if this was intentional, but I’m deleting it. A subscription fee that exceeds the cost of buying the book is ridiculous."
"3374",529815782,"This app was good when I bought it, over a year ago. And then came the updates! It constantly repeats itself, doesn’t give you much clue or tip (real ones not the bla-bla-bla of now) and keep on reminding you that each kid is different and goes at his own pace bla-bla-bla. So basically they don’t say anything and you don’t learn much... too bad, I liked it BEFORE. Now, there is nothing in this app that you can’t find on the internet."
"3375",529815782,"I bought a great app.  Then it upgraded an app that is one giant ad for the book... so I paid to be advertised to.  Nice ploy.    I still struggle to see what these leaps are in my child, there’s nothing remotely similar to the described behavior anywhere near the times they list, and support for dating questions has been paltry at best. It’s still good information about development and skills my baby is learning, just because it doesn’t come close to describing my child certainly doesn’t mean it’s wrong.   I’m fairly angry about the huge loss of info with the update though. Crappy move."
"3376",529997671,"Do you Disney play really want Bizaardvark the movie I’m a six-year-old"
"3377",529997671,"It’s a great way to watch disney Channel! Especially if you don’t have cable. Like me. I definitely recommend this app. It functions great. And has great quality! Absolutely love!  ❤️😋😃"
"3378",529997671,"It is fun watching Disney channel on tv or on your iPad Have fun watching Disney Channel on TV or on your iPad it is very fun so I don’t miss every thing OK"
"3379",530060483,"This port has a lot of potential, but the controls in this version hold it back from being great.  One major issue is the movement. You will often find yourself stopping in the middle of movement because your thumb will slightly be off the joystick. This creates an incredibly unenjoyable experience, especially when the game requires your movement to be slick and reactive. If that can be fixed, I can see myself having fun with this game. Otherwise, I'd rather save myself from the frustration.  Also, please add iPhone X support."
"3380",530060483,"Great game. I have completed the final mission several times and cannot replay it after completing. It re-makes me play mission 4 to get to the final mission again. Also can you update for iPhone X?"
"3381",530060483,"Awful controls either I pay attention to game or to controls. Always loved the game but these controls just made me give it a one star. Glad I only bought one game instead of the bundle."

"3384",530168168,"This has gotten laughable. It continues to give me a “fatal error” message every time I try to play something. This is my 3rd review in a month. I received 2 emails from the developers and they both said to update to 7.0.6 and they told another person to update to 7.0.5 BUT their latest update is 7.0.7 WHAT IN THE WORLD!!! I’ll go spend my time and money elsewhere. No Way should it take a big developer like CBS over a month to get their crap together."

"3388",530445196,"I was very excited about the concept of this game.  I found myself rather disappointed.  The stat bonus system is absolutely tedious!  The game has MAJOR balance issues - toward the end equipment doesn’t even matter since your character stats are enormous in comparison.  All my characters get 1 shot killed and only win by mobbing enemies.  The jobs are ... bad.  Most of these (like merchant, Carpenter etc) should just be aspects of town building.  I don’t want to fight dragons with merchants, carpenters and ... clowns???  The endgame character class (no need for diversity because it dominates everything) is literally a blockhead.  The present / medal system also silly and tedious.  I wanted to build a town, attract character classes based on how I developed my town (which would five replay value) instead of “collect them all.”  I was looking forward to the passive nature of this game but found myself constantly sucked into tedious tasks.    Worth a play through but ZERO replay value.  The concept is amazing.  If the developer had consulted to implement better and more traditional rpg mechanics for the characters this could have been such an amazing game.  Turned out kinda mediocre."
"3389",530445196,"Been playing this game for years! It’s always a great game to come back to and beat again!"
"3390",530445196,"I would really like for devs to make a DV 2 and I would definitely buy it. Or make more content to this one. Game is so freaking addictive that once you accomplish everything you are left with the desire for the game to be infinite like those ascending games where everything get reset but you get an extra benefit every time you ascend.   This game worth every penny and would love to see more 🙄🙄🙄😁😁😁"
"3391",530621395,"So I’ve noticed that y’all added tax?? Why :( it much better when that was not included, also some products are sold like “$2.47” why can’t it just be $2 or $3? It was better when none of that was added in. I love this app i shop a lot, but the cents ain’t it. Hope y’all decide to not tax & add cents in"

"3394",530809322,"Just downloaded this app, it does not work and I paid for it. Says loading for about a second, then the screen goes black. I also erased and redownloaded did not work."

"3397",530957470,"Just love this app for making cards, pictures, special notes, scrapbook photos. Easy to use and fun to create!!   I have used several photo apps and this one really has quite a bit to offer. All kinds of frames, backgrounds, stickers and effects to work with and have something really great to save and share!!   Highly recommend upgrading because every time developer adds something new, you get it also!!"

"3401",530957474,"it’s pretty good for a mostly free app, it works well for basic stuff. in the sticker section, however, i would like to report that it is extremely heteronormative. so there’s that. it’s good tho"
"3402",530957474,"I thought the app was free than got an annual fee of 47.99. I’m sure it was in some fine print somewhere but I was frustrated none the less"

"3405",531184261,"This game is really well done, the gameplay is smooth, the AI is challenging and adaptive but not overly frustrating, and their is a good collection of guns and customization. Only thing is please please add iPhone X support so I don’t have black spaces on the sides of my screen."
"3406",531325150,"I downloaded this app just to see if it was true and I literally saw a white no face man with a f*ing knife I swear to god I was scared to death.

"3416",532046195,"Real gem in the rough. Tone sphere is a unique and interesting take on the standard rhythm game. With good songs, novel gameplay, and cool design, this game is definitely worth trying."
"3417",532046195,"The new released 'dark sphere' is pure wonder and well worth the wait. I like the song 'Astra walk through' in particular."
"3418",532138534,"I loved this game until I couldn’t play it any more because the software wasn’t able to go with the current versions! So if the developers read this please update it!"
"3419",532138534,"This is a great game filled with endless hours of fun but the only issue now is almost nobody can play it because of iOS 11 .  So please make the fans of this game happy and update it to make this masterpiece to work with iOS 11!"
"3420",532138534,"I bought this game a few years ago and thought it was pretty fun but I never finished it. I decided to try it again and can’t even play it now!"
"3421",533024665,"I love this game but what is the point of having other people with you I haven’t beaten the game yet but the people don’t even help you they just sit there and eat your food and so on"
"3422",533024665,"It charged me for the expansion TWICE because at first I thought it didn’t go through and I’m still not able to play it :( other than ripping me off it’s a fun game"
"3423",533024665,"I just bought this game last night and played it three times. During the last play through I was able to make it to safe haven. Everyone in perfect health, car running great but a little low on ammo. Ok, now to collect 8 gas cans. Don’t ask me how this happened but I lost my entire part in less than 5 minutes. One touch from a zombie is an instant kill. My leader was attacked or touched by zombies too many times while scavenging, but was easily healed with medkits. I had several but wasn’t allowed to use them if a zombie touched me searching for the gas cans. That seemed like a low blow to me after making it this far in perfect health. After sacrificing my last teammate to have the zombies eat him to distract, I collected the remaining 3 gas cans. Strangely, I ended up collecting 13 of 8 gas cans and then the game was stuck and couldn’t get to the next part. Very frustrating and disappointed after thinking this was a great game up to this point. I’ll try it again and see if I can get 8 of 8 cans cans this time."

But to me that’s no reason to make it 4stars because what game doesn’t do that but other than that great game !"
"3428",533079551,"This is just like COD Zombies and it also has an endless mode unlike other zombie games on the AppStore! I usually get the AK47 when I start the game because it’s amazing for lower levels. But please add more to the story and apart from that it’s an amazing game. Wow! You read all of this?

"3435",534160364,"Awesome game"
"3436",534282109,"I gave it 4 stars only because even if the game is fun and relaxing it needs alot of work still. They need to update it by giving us humans and natural disasters. Wouldn't it be nice having a volcano that erupts or hurricanes and even rain storms? If we are all paying for this game then the least you can do is update the game.I hesitated it to buy it but i have high hopes they will have a major update soon. Please listen to us!!!!"
"3437",534282109,"The more support this game gets from the players, the better updates we will have in the future. I have been waiting for this title to be released and I'm so glad to own it on my iPhone! I am very pleased with the look and feel of the game. The controls are simple enough, you don't really need much of a Tutorial to get started (although I'm glad it was there to follow).  Any Strategy, RPG or Achievement features in future updates will absolutely have continued support from me. This title sets itself apart from all other games released in the App Store. Great work, Crescent Moon and Glenn Corpes!  [EDIT] Crescent & Corpes, Just take a step back to previous releases (such as Topia World Builder) and polish them off a tad bit more ;) Topia is analogous to an unfinished sculpture that shouldn’t take too much effort to polish, but it would be great if the imbalances everyone is mentioning are tweaked. Put your mind to it and create a balance between all ecology. Do that, and players can REALLY create their world and watch it thrive."
"3438",534282109,"It wont let me do anything! It just puts me through some dumb credits and I don’t get to make anything aside from the tutorials. I’m so angry!! 😡 please fix NOW I just spent REAL MONEY and I would like to BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME I MEAN HOW CAN YOU MISS THAT"
"3439",534342529,"Fun and addictive but the ads!!! I HATE the long boring ads! A quick flash of an ad would work better with me. If an ad frustrates me I will refuse to use a product! For example that solitaire ad has taken so much of my time I won’t even look at it and I love solitaire. Don’t force long ads on me and I’d give this game 5 stars!"
"3440",534342529,"Great game!"
"3441",534342529,"I love bubble mania.  This is the best game ever.  It is fun and challenging and the games keep changing which holds my interest.  Each new island contains a new game twist.  Jump in and swim to the fun!  Dr. purplebaker"
"3442",534477679,"I absolutely hate it it is soo not worth like 3$"

"3449",534568162,"I use it to watch past fights and they update the new ones pretty fast. I can’t pay for the newer fights this is a great alternative."
"3450",534568162,"The mammoth amount of fights available on ufc fight pass alone is worth the app and every penny of the membership. Navigation is a little wompy but everything works and plays smooth. There’s a lot more to the fight pass than just ufc. If you’re a fan of combat sports, it is seriously a must. I can’t speak to the usefulness of the app outside of Ufcfightpass though."
"3451",534960206,"I have all the apps by this developer, the papers are pure awesomeness.  I had no use to try the video insert until recently,  The quality is not so great. Otherwise an outstanding app."
"3452",534960206,"Original review: Love the bubbles but would love more.  The finished product looks great but would love more flexibility with shapes and a way to save ""favorite"" settings etc. Glad I have it though.  Was a 4 but now a 2 Star rating. This app used to be called BubbleFrame, and inexplicably got a “makeover”, but unfortunately not to my expectations. What happened to the beautiful logo which actually made sense (It said Bubble Frames, and showed Bubble frames, imagine that) and how did it change from all bubble frames, to other random frames, too, which I have other apps that can already do this and just clutters up the app. Why did I lose the ability to create single bubble-shaped frames, without having to pay for an IAP to unlock this, when I bought this app years ago and it allowed for single bubbles? I used to use this a lot for my Apps blog, but am unhappy with the changes."
"3453",534960206,"I wish there were updates on backgrounds for the collages.   I LOVE that you can download your own fonts!!"
"3454",535127218,"I have played/coached in dozens of organized sports leagues and Upward Sports is BY FAR the most efficient and effective. As a coach, this app provides a “one stop shop” for accessing all the tools I need for communicating with parents, practice and game schedules, preparing weekly training, reviewing objectives, and many other necessary tasks that would ordinarily take dozens of hours to complete. This app allows coaches to spend more time investing in the children, which to me, is the most important thing."
"3455",535127218,"This is a wonderful tool for Upward, but it does glitch.  I have already lost all data once.  Having to log on each time is also a hassle...once on my device it should be able to open and run without a log in.  There is nothing that merits bank account security measures."
"3456",535127218,"Not a bad app but never leaves me signed in, even when i toggle to stay signed in."
"3457",535153636,"This is not accurate at all. Would give zero stars. It matched me with a woman of a different race."
"3458",535153636,"It is just terrible"
"3459",535153636,"I would get done putting a picture in and then I would submit the things I liked and then it clicked enter, well the loading thing came up and I thought nothing of I gave it a few minutes but nothing and then it kicked me out of the game! I have perfect internet and everything i still don’t get why it wouldn’t give me my results. If I could rate this a 0 I definitely would!  |•DONT BUY THIS•|"
"3460",535176909,"It’s good game and I enjoying it!"
"3461",535176909,"This app is a really good app and I like it a lot I love playing it all the time I love making levels. I also like that you can play with friends so I’ll just ask my friends to come over and we just play Badlands and then we get to create levels together and overall this is a awesome app I paid $.99 for it and it was awesome so you guys should try it anyone who sees it and who’s interested in it to try it it’s a really good app I recommend it for all ages and I gave this a five star rating. Thank you 👍🏼🙃"

"3490",536475199,"I've had some difficulty finding educational apps that my 18 month old daughter enjoys and is capable of playing. This app is PERFECT! She easily picked up on it and even loves the menu screen where she can interact with different objects that move and make sounds. I'm sure she will continue to play this for at least another year or two as she learns to talk and count herself. Definitely worth the cost and highly recommend to parents of other young toddlers."
"3491",536475199,"Not the best app. Keeps my two year old busy for a short time and then he gets bored. Doesn't really teach them to count, just tapping on pictures. However, for the price it's worth the few minutes of entertainment."

"3495",536495161,"I’ve read a few reviews about how this app was made worse with the upgrade from 9 months ago. I agree with them. It used to be Great, BUT NOT ANYMORE. I loved this app and did a lot of time lapse and stop motion with it. I had many more plans to continue to use it. However, with the new update I’ve had a hard time getting motivated to use it. They dumbed it down to try and appeal to the novice. However, this has made it so that I don’t like to use it. Some of the changes that have made it worse are: 1. Made it so that I cannot change the frame rate. I can only change the length of the video. However, sometimes it take me more than one shoot to complete a video. Since I cannot change the frame rate I have to hope I get all the length accurate so the video speed works right. 2. The preview mode loops the video. So, when I watch a preview it plays it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Until I finally realize that I’ve watched it many times. Especially, since the default time is 5 seconds. Who does a 4000 frame time lapse video in 5 seconds? 3. The settings window is useless. First, it’s too small to use, why not make it fill most of the screen? Second, I’ve changed the settings and closed out of them. However, when I get back in the settings, its as if I didn’t even do anything. What is the point of having settings if I cannot change the settings. Get us back to the ugly looking version that ACTUALLY WORKED!!!  One last point, I would pay at least $20, or more, for a good quality time lapse - stop motion app. This app used to be worth that. Now its not even worth the storage space it is written on."

I’ve been playing it on my iPad and it’s beautiful and I think the perfect size. I ignored the part that said to wear headphones and played several times without one. Wish now I hadn’t. It’s a completely different experience with the sounds I never heard, streams of music I missed and even parts of the narration I missed as well. Wear headphones! And try different mixes of weapons, etc. You may think you have the perfect combination until you try something else. Some things work better in different parts of the game. I love this game!

Unfortunately it is very unstable, it’s very slow to start and just gets stuck or completely crashes on a regular basis. One of the problems seems to be with the server, but the app itself has issues as well - especially with ‘older, less powerful’ devices. We have a fast internet, and the only device (of the four I have tried it on) the app works with reasonably well is my iPad Pro - but even this has to be regularly restarted to get the app working. And I don’t mean closing just the app, but I literally have to do a complete shutdown and restart of the device!

Lastly when you accidentally press upgrade on the cues it doesn’t even say “do you want to upgrade this cue”, I wouldn’t say this if it was cheep, they usually cost over 1k or 2k.

"3581",544007664,"YouTube is a great idea however the people behind it are way too biased. They forcefully remove videos because some people get their feelings hurt even if what was said was accurate. Feelings are being placed above the truth. They claim they are a platform however they act as if they are publishers and ban people with whom they disagree. They create vague guidelines like no hate speech, but don’t define what counts as hate speech and then they arbitrarily ban people who break this undefined guideline. Videos of people civilly having discussions are demonetized for some unknown reason. And there are many more failings of YouTubes policies on what is acceptable in the videos that people upload."

"3585",544118997,"Great app until something goes wrong. For me it was my mom forgetting her email address. Those that use the app know that when you first make a purchase you get 10 dollars back. She bought some stuff for my dad for his birthday and when she went to get her cash back she needed to verify her email. Since she’s not too good with technology I emailed ebates for her. They changed her email after I provided some proof but they also combined my account and hers because they thought we were the same person trying to get 10 dollars. After multiple emails, talking to multiple different members, explaining how we are not the same person, they still refused to give her money to her. It got to the point where I scheduled to a time to call and talk with them, but they conveniently called in a time I was not free. After a while I just gave up on it. I hope no one ever has to deal with their customer support like I had to. Oh and the only reason they thought that we were the same person was because I used my paypal for her account. Like I said she’s not good with technology so instead of waiting for a check of 10 dollars to come in I said I would give her the money and just use my PayPal. No matter how many people I talked to, they just kept bringing that up and even after I wasted my time doing things they wanted to prove I wasn’t trying to scam the system, they still kept repeating the fact that my PayPal is on her account. If the company is that desperate to keep their 10 dollars, maybe they shouldn’t have offered it as a starting bonus.  Months later still haven’t been helped even after I write this review and followed the steps they asked for. I sent them what they wanted and they never responded. I sent another message asking how much longer it would take, and shocker, they didn’t respond."
"3586",544119998,"If you like synths, get this! One of my faves. Gives awesome crisp modern sounds, but can do a good range in general. There are lots of synths out there, but I feel this one has a character that really sets it apart from others. Kauldron is also a great one from this developer. The two are definitely on my top 8 must-have list.  This synth has so many features, yet it is so well designed that it’s super straightforward to use. Everything is in the right place. No clutter, yet a lot of controls per page. I usually prefer external fx, but in this synth they really fit in well with the sound.  It’s hard to pick a best synth in terms of sound because each covers different ground or different approaches to sound design, but in terms of UI it’s easier to pick because a lot of synths have weak UI. Magellan is definitely at the top, along with Nave - both being beautiful and usable at the same time. Both feel like you have a hardware synth in your hands, and are just a pleasure to use for the eyes, ears, and fingers too.  Only request I have is, please make presets save both synths. There are 2 synth engines that can be used individually or together. You can save each independently and load them, but can’t save the two combined. Using both engines really gives beautifully huge sound! As a workaround I save them as name-part1, name-part2 so it’s not really that hard to load the two together later, just think it makes more sense to just treat both synths as a single preset. Oh, and if you could give this synth an AUv3... goes without saying ;)"
"3587",544119998,"This synth looks amazing and it’s easy to modify the sounds and customize things to your liking and it sounds nice through the iPad speakers.

"3592",544695089,"Or the best one out of the three.   TWEWY is an amazing game and story.  If you have a chance to play it you should!  The story is interesting and the location of Shibuya comes alive.   On why this is the best version of the game:  I have played this game on all systems it has come on.   •The DS graphics are just a little tired and needing to “mingle” with other people IRL playing it for LVing up certain pins makes it hard and time consuming.  (But it can be done given just lots of time waiting)  And sometimes playing on both screens doing different things can give you a headache.  Over all though it’s a lot of fun.  •This app has updated graphics and increased the storyline a little.  All the pins still LV up in the same way as before.  When you need to “mingle” just play TinPin Slammer.  I find this to be the easiest of all the versions to play overall.  However this app did stop working a few years ago after a iOS update and it took SquareEnix months to get it working again.  But this is also the cheapest of all the versions as well.  I don’t think that will happen again however.  •The Switch version of TWEWY is the newest but uses the same graphics as the app.  (Its mainly a port of the app with another small epilogue added to hint at another game that may or may not come)  It also changes how you LV up certain pins by totally removing “mingle” points.  Not a difficult thing to deal with but it is worth mentioning.  The problem with the Switch version of this game is the controls.  None of them want to work!  Touchscreen works the most like the older versions.  Trying to used a controller means only using 1 and motion control which is a little wonky.   Switch is also currently the most expensive.   I hope this helps other people decide what version of this wonderful game they want to play."
"3593",544695089,"But this version is missing a lot and I know that the mobile version is not supposed to look like this. I’m missing basically every cutscene in the game and even redownloading the app didn’t work. It’s a shame because I’ve been very interested in playing the game for so long only to pay almost $20.00 for an incomplete version."

"3602",545689128,"When this app is needed the most, it takes too long for the data to be updated. I have been watching the latest hurricane and it takes around 3 hours to update tracking information. The updates come every 6 hours but the app does not get updated as quickly. It should be as easy as changing a few data points since the cones are a standard algorithm."

"3607",546287349,"Great game, I have loved it for a long time. I am obsessed with the animal diversity. However, there is only labradors for the dog aspect, and in other games you are capable of creating multiple dog breeds. Possibly even customers seeking specific breeds? Also, maybe a different cat model, like a long haired cat or even a hairless cat. Maybe more reindeer and foal coat variations, as well as some new animals such as chinchillas, ferrets, lizards, rats, sugar gliders!! Thank you for continuing to be so active in the upbringing of this awesome game! 💖💖✨"

"3609",546287349,"Hello 👋 I love this game dearly! It is very fun and teaches you to care for, respect, and love animals❤️. Perfect for people of all ages! Kid friendly, perfecto 👌 I love all your hard work you've put into this game. Your so nice to your customers, the customer service is just 💯 and your animals? They are so cute, tenderly and lovingly made. The amount of effort you guys have put into your games, constantly improving it is what a true good app developer does. You don't see many good app developers anymore. This is just... amazing!☺️ stay strong you guys!!♥️♥️  As for that, I would just like to make a few friendly suggestions.  Could we please have more animals? Yes, I know, there are quite a few animals already in there, but many pet shelters accept more then that I'm sure. You should add:  Falcons,Robins,Ducks and Chickens (that is a must!😂😂) This may sound bizarre but.. Can you add crocodiles? 😂 sorry I love crocodiles 🐊  You should add more wild animals.. Monkeys and kangaroos/ joeys whatever they are  You guys should definitely add lynx cubs or something  Cows and llamas!!! Please cows and llamas!!!  Otters!!!  Pleaseeee♥️♥️♥️ This is turning into more like a zoo but.. 🤷🏻‍♀️😂  Love you guys, keep working hard and doing good! I'm always here to support you guys!💕"

"3623",546871573,"After reaching level 200 something, the game all of a sudden just stopped offering new rooms. The last room I got into is Spring Rain, and no matter what I did and how games I played in that room, I have had no new room to advance to. I contacted customer support multiple times and only got their templated email response. I never got any answer or explanation."
"3624",546871573,"I really enjoyed playing this game, but now find myself playing less and less. Too many frickin’ ads!! I get it...to get an extra ball or some benefit, ya watch an ad,  but now there are ads in between what seems like every game as well. It gets old! I’m sorry,  I know this game is free but as far as I feel you’ve sold out. Not to mention, it crashes a lot more than it use to, and I lose whatever it was I was playing. At first I thought it was my tablet, cuz it was old, but now I have a new tablet and it still does it, and now after reading a lot of these reviews, I tend to think it wasn’t my old tablet after all. From the looks of it, you guys are losing people left and right, I would think you’d want to do something to rectify that, and make this game fun to play again, but like a lot of the reviews on here, I guess you’re in it for the money.....well good luck with that."

Every time my phone breaks or I get a new phone, I download this game right away and every time I have to start COMPLETELY over! When you are on level 235 it just breaks your heart. The only other thing I dislike is that, again, since I don’t have Facebook so I’m a guest, during the daily reward if I get the frog toggle, I get nothing at all. Besides the whole Facebook/account thing, I love this game and spend a lot of time playing."

Tailslides and nose slides are fun, but they almost never lock into any surface. Sometimes when big tricks are done but the board just slightly touches an object (even if you still land) it will count the trick as a fail because a part of the board knicked a ledge or rail over your gap. Little things like these need improvements, NOT MORE SKATEPARKS FOR MONEY. Use the money we are giving you to improve the bugs in this game. Every time I see an update it just says “bug fixes” I haven’t seen one. Be more descriptive on what you are fixing and be more attentive to your players."

"3669",550221096,"So like me you got all excited that Outlander was added to Netflix. You suit up in tartan and get ready to watch. Approximately two straight days of watching later it all comes to a grinding halt when Netflix suggests you try other historical dramas. But why? This can’t be! You’ve only seen two seasons and you know there are two more and in a panic you take to Google to demand answers. Here you learn Netflix, the Zeus of all streaming services, has only been able to acquire the first two seasons and you must stoop to Prime or Hulu or....Starz to continue. But Prime and Hulu require you to buy a Starz pass so with a sinking heart you realise there’s only one way forward. You must use your time wisely and your one week of free Starz to watch the other two seasons. You sign up and download the app only to find you get “login error” every time you try, the app is useless and your well planned binge watch is ruined. This is where I‘m at and now I’m tied to my laptop for the foreseeable future all because the app is dysfunctional and I hate a cliff hanger."

"3681",551407760,"The second you enter this virtual horse world you are sucked in. You start off with a lower level horse, but you can soon buy more competitive horses and compete in more competitions. I've never had any glitches or with this game and I personally enjoy just watching my horses compete and leaving it up to the computer to decide whether I will do well or not. I do wish that there would be more options for training and possibly more courses to compete with. There are only six whereas  Race Horse Championships (another great game by them that I highly recommend) has 15. Another great thing about this game is that you can breed horses. The cost of breeding depends on the sire and dam that you choose. My only problem with breeding is that it gets more expensive each time you do it. The graphics aren't anything over the top, but I personally like more simplistic games which is just another reason why I love this! If you love horses or just want a fun game to play, this is definitely the right game for you."

Last yer I was super excited to see this app.  Then I was super depressed that it did not come with a smartboard camera.  I found a hack around this by downloading an amazing app called GoodNotes.  You can use the lasso tool there to capture images and then copy and paste those into your smart notebook file. This app has a propensity to close an not save your information which is maddening.  Also, the inability to create folders to organize your files is ridiculous.  Cmon Smartboard, you’re better than that.   The saving grace is that I am finally able to work on my lessons comfortably from my couch.  That’s worth 3 stars to me.  Oh, and the app is free."

Thanks for making this game, I hope you consider my input!"

If (Please don’t) the Dems win the presidency, we may have to go popular vote, figure out the jail systems, know where all the illegal immigrants are living  and realize 16 year olds can vote. That make 2022 and 2024 almost impossible to figure out, except free handouts for all. AND YOU MAY HAVE AOC in 2024 if she turns 35 before then. You can then rename this “Fear Factor” then!"
"3723",554533253,"Love the game, excellent time passing game, especially if you’re a political freak, however what I dislike about this game is there isn’t many senerios, I would like to change the name of my campaign and also would like a handicapped menu where you could change states and their electoral votes to make it to where it could be any year election, would be great! Especially if I’m paying nearly 3 dollars"

"3725",554597348,"I played this on my friends phone. It was a great game. On iPad mini it will crash when you press play."

Well it is all true.I downloaded this game and I was playing with Angela so I left for a couple minutes and when I came back her eyes where red.As soon as I saw this I also saw a guy or a man in her eyes so I got out of the game as soon as I saw that so I deleted it the next day.So DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IM SERIOUS"

"3742",555233356,"I don’t understand why this would be so outdated.   I literally have the classic version, just not the original. This means characters and rooms are the same with the exception of new additions, like Dr. Orchid. You literally can’t purchase the original in stores anymore.  There should be an option to add/change the rooms, weapons, and characters. I don’t understand why you can’t customize the app seeing that it simply runs algorithms to calculate who absolutely does and does not have what cards.   Customization should really be an option in this app. I mean, it even saves the developers time seeing as they don’t have to update it to include new cards EVER.  I already paid for the app, but I’d be willing to pay up to 5x the price I did for it to simply be customizable so that it works for any version.   I left 1 star because it isn’t compatible with my game, even though I have the updated classic version (the one available in store). I will update my review pending a response that goes over plans to capitalize on this, or an update to include customization."
"3743",555233356,"The rooms do not match the rooms in our game. We have a kitchen, bathroom, office, bedroom, courtyard, game room, garage, living room, and dining room. The flip side is a boardwalk with Ferris wheel, jet ski rental, beach, beach house, arcade, and surf shop. Would be good if names could be adjusted accordingly. We were excited to try the app to use in place of paper. My kids and I play the game frequently."
"3744",555233356,"There is no poison as weapon. It guessed the weapon was a card I was holding. Does not work."
"3745",555376968,"Using this fantasy football app is what I imagine it feels like trying to figure out an iPhone as a 100 year old with Alzheimer’s. It’s so difficult to use, the interface is unappealing and riddled with advertisements, and there’s far to many steps to see simple data at times. The Yahoo Fantasy Football app is far and away better, easier to use, and more visually appealing. I love ESPN, but this app needs a MAJOR revamp or I’ll be sticking with Yahoo."
"3746",555376968,"Can’t do a lot of the stuff in the app that you can do on the site, especially when it comes to player research. It’s absolute torture in the app, due to some really stupid design decisions."
"3747",555376968,"Love the app and everything about it it’s great but the only problem is after I draft a team it disappears I’ve tried logging out and back in I’ve tried lookin for it on line instead of the app I used to love playin with people and betting but now I’m loosing my teams. Ik there is a limit but I don’t even have one"

"3752",555641008,"Nice game but needs some updates well at least you can restore your purchases"
"3753",555641008,"I like epic especially the 2nd game is little better but I like the old school stuff so epic gets a 5 stars."
"3754",555916407,"I appreciate a challenging puzzle, but there’s absolutely zero help in this game. It’s also not friendly to people who are hard of hearing or who have ringing in their ears like I do. I can’t get past the dark woods. I’m assuming that you have to choose the path with appropriate scale tone, but it’s very frustrating for people with damaged hearing. Otherwise I absolutely loved the content and the graphics. Problem is that when you get stuck, you’re 100% totally done with the game. So I guess I’m done about 10 minutes in."
"3755",555916407,"there’s a difference between being challenging yet engaging and rewarding and being completely obtuse and impenetrable. year walk’s puzzles are the latter. there’s also a difference between creating a creepy, haunting atmosphere and having jumpscares every time the player makes any progress. again, year walk is the latter. it would be cynical to say the obnoxious difficulty is to stretch the game’s length out to justify asking for 4 dollars, but unfortunately that seems to be pretty accurate. the companion is a nice idea but the lore it provides is pretty categorically not helpful. the art and sound design are nice. if you want good puzzles and/or creepy atmosphere i’d recommend something out of the cube escape series (many of which are FREE) or even this same company’s title DEVICE 6, which is superb. year walk, however, is just too unintuitive and poorly executed to recommend."
"3756",555916407,"I honestly loved this game. The puzzles are challenging and the story is very intriguing. I will say that it is important for someone playing this to get the companion. Besides having information about the research that went into the game, it is essential to unlocking the alternate ending."
"3757",555936735,"Enjoy it! Best of all of them!best there is!"
"3758",555936735,"Love this game been playing for years❤️"
"3759",555936735,"I am actually addicted to this game-love it! The people who design are unbelievable! Good job everyone involved,"
"3760",556164008,"WAY too many downloads. Every time I log in it’s a 10min process. And without purchasing gold coins you are basically a spectator."
"3761",556164008,"As soon as I got another iPad that is the same as mine. And it's super fun and now I'm on the American cars. So I have to say that I am sorry I said you are the worst and I'm not playing your games anymore. I'm gonna play one of your games right now and I will put a 5 star review."
"3762",556164008,"Don’t get me wrong, this is a very good app. But in my case it just takes up too much space on my phone. Other then that it is really fun. The graphics are great, and it is so fun to play."
"3763",556382158,"This game is a blast to play on any phone older than the iPhone X. The controls need to be brought up from the swipe to home button. I used to play this when I had an older phone, but can no longer play with the X."
"3764",556382158,"Ok. I love this game and would give it 5 stars, but... Played it several times over and try different tactics each time to keep it interesting. However, just tried to play recently and I can’t use the bottom slider to turn my ships or aim the turrets without closing or switching the app. iPhoneX uses screen gestures. Anyone have a fix for this?!"
"3765",556382158,"The way this game was built, means you cannot play on an iPhone 10. Can’t change direction or anything as the control for that is the same place as the function on the phone to close an app."
"3766",556430416,"This game is INCREDIBLE!!! I’m twelve years old, and seriously, you shouldn’t be fooled by the 4 plus heading, because if you use my hack, this game is for all ages. In the app, not only can you choose designs and accessorize your character, but also choose photos from your camera role to use when making the clothes. So, keep reading for the hack: you can search the web for any image you want, or even a paused moment from a video- really anything you can screenshot. Then, enter the app and go to the photo album, where you can use your screenshot as a design for a shirt, dress, skirt, pants, shorts, or sleeves. Or all of the above! I’ve already spent hours browsing the web for photos that match the accessories in the app, and by using this hack, you likely will too. This game has virtually no limits, and I have only one warning: once you download it, you won’t ever want to put your phone down. 😄😄😄"
"3767",556430416,"OK so let’s game is super fun and addicting but I wish there was a way to get out of the photo thing I tried it and I was stuck in there my iPad is frozen and I won’t unfreeze like what so if you don’t have this problem you should definitely buy it if you have this problem delete the app and re-download it that would be awesome I have no idea how to fix my problem."
"3768",556430416,"I have had this game for so long. Its great.I love designing close and i have so much fun.Everybody should play this"

"3773",556867879,"I love this game it is really fun I just need to clear volcano valley"
"3774",556867879,"This was my childhood game and I loved it ever since. It is soooooooooooooooo fun but then 2 years ago my iPad got stolen. I got a new one and I was surprised it didn’t cost money. I finished the game a few times and I always got stuck at the end. And remember this and it brings me back to the time when I was 3 😭😭😭😭"
"3775",557121061,"I especially appreciate importing PDF books & highlighting, making notes & doodles/illustrations on with Note.  Powerful app."
"3776",557121061,"i’ve been using this app for so long i can’t remember how many years!   And it’s STILL my FAVORITE APP ❣️"
"3777",557121061,"I have tried a lot of the multi-purpose (typing, handwriting, audio and video, import web materials, and presentation) apps, and I like this one the best (by far). Here's why.  1.  The handwriting recognition module (an in-app purchase), called Mazec, is simply the most reliable and easy to use of any offered. 2.  The variety of writing implements offered are easy to access, and the handwriting experience is excellent.  Because of ease of access, it is easy to change implements quickly -- essential for note taking in a fast-paced classroom or lecture environment. 3.  One can use pinch and zoom or bottom zoom for handwriting. Writing with pinch and zoom also has auto scrolling, so you don't get stray lines on your page. 3.  Pages and backgrounds can be imported or created and then made into templates.  Thus, the user has an infinite variety of page backgrounds. 4.  One can cut and paste pages not only between documents, but also between Metamoji apps (for example, between Note and Share). 5. The entire note background (not just the page) can be used for posting photos and typed materials; handwriting can be created on the page and then moved (pasted) on the note background.  Thus the entire canvas (page and note background) can be used. 6. App can accommodate very long notes (over 100 pages) without slowing down.   7. Notes can be stored in a comprehensive filing system using folders and infinite levels of subfolders.   8. Tagging system allows the same note to be stored in several folders at once.  Just add tags corresponding to different folders' names, and the note appears in all the named folders. 9. The app has its own cloud system, Metamoji cloud, which works reliably.  Documents can thus be synced among devices. 10.  The iPhone app is as full-featured as the apps for iPad, and one purchase covers everything.  I am sure that I have forgotten to mention some other crucially important features.  I use this app for everything.  I would probably need several apps in order to do all that this one can do."
"3778",557130558,"I’ve used this app for over 2 years now and a lot has drastically changed.  Pros: You meet language natives of the language you want to learn. It gives you a little bit experience in tutoring your own native language. You get to share cultures with other people. You have the chance to make many friends.  Cons: Sometimes when I take too long to make a post on the moments, Hellotalk automatically restarts and doesn’t save my progress. Many times, I’ve had this bug issue where friends would send me a message and I would not receive it until way later. Another bug issue is that sometimes I’m not able to view the moments, messages, or people recommendations because the app is unable to connect.  There are a lot of toxic trolls that have tried to start arguments with me, on my moments posts and they constantly return to any new posts I make. There are a lot of people that don’t try to exchange language or culture. I’ve gotten few VERY weird messages from both genders, from different countries. Due to the amount of weird, shady, and toxic people on the app; it makes finding friends/language partners, very difficult as a male. The system for moderating the moments is a bit unfair.         —Someone reported one of my posts for being “a dating purpose”, although that was not my intent nor did I ask any questions for dating on that post. Instead, the post was taken down without question and I got a warning. I have doubts that the post was manually reviewed. I didn’t even know what the post was, and I had to personally use the in-app messaging to Hellotalk to question what was taken down. Although it was just a warning, I’ve noticed that no one is viewing my educational posts anymore on the moments. So I’m assuming that I’m being censored without my own knowledge, considering that I have over 1000 people that follow me because they view my moments as useful for practice and learning.  Overall, the intent of the app’s goal is admirable; but it is severely lacking in specific areas that cause many good people to voluntarily leave the app."
"3779",557130558,"The main language has changed suddenly and they didn’t fix it. That made the app is 0% useful.  +VIP is a joke .."
"3780",557130558,"I love meeting with chatting with natives and I love the fact that the conversation can automatically translate and the feature to correct. My only comment would be I wish I could set my preferences as to who can contact me or see me. The messages can get overwhelming especially if it's not what you are looking for. I know you filter in search but I would to just set my preference in my profile. Example: Brazilian Portuguese vs European Portuguese."
"3781",557153158,"Have had about three transactions on here and i met great people to do business with"
"3782",557153158,"I have purchased several things from Shpock. I cannot recommend this app. In fact I recommend you stay away. I was scammed out of 600 pounds and after reporting it Shpock didn’t respond for days. When they did days later they told me the transaction was fraudulent. Really?!!! I had already told them. I then followed the scammer and they are still posting on Shpock. The company refuses to check IP address and do anything.  They have an obligation to protect customers but instead they protect the criminals. Run from Shpock."

"3792",558094294,"I love this game! I enjoy playing it on breaks! Really want to ask the developers - is it possible that you could have the Dino event again, or something similar to that? It was so fun but I missed out on the chance to get a Dino because I had things to do..."

"3797",558270538,"I’ve used Readdle Docs (free) for quite some time, but... So I saw I had this File Manager (free) on my iPad Pro (2017). I don’t remember getting it, but gave it a try. Started copying files over and within 30 minutes, I bought File Manager Pro.  WHAT A STRUGGLE/NIGHTMARE! The Pro install left the Free version on my machine and imported  NOTHING! So I uninstalled the Free version and started ALL OVER AGAIN with the Pro version... The NIGHTMARE CONTINUED! Then after about 1/2 hour I glanced at the Tutorial. Didn’t think much of it - pretty basic - a quick, cursory review and it gave me a couple ideas of things to try. 10 more minutes and the clouds parted, the sunshine came out and this is app is 5 stars for sure.  Sometimes, it seems like the more irritated I get the less I’m willing to look at a tutorial. ...phfffff"
"3798",558270538,"Would be nice to have a search tool so an item, like pdf, jpg, doc, xlsx, etc and let app find all such documents regardless of location.  I use Microsoft OneDrive cloud account and use iPhone and iPad plus Windows 10 laptop.  Would make app handier."
"3799",558433129,"Honestly hands down a really good game I would highly recommend this! But the only issue is that you haven’t updated it to make it compatible with IOS 11 and I really think you should update it to make it compatible because it was such a good game!"
"3800",558433129,"I used to love this game and it’s story mode but now I can’t play anymore cause the update you need to update so it can work with iOS 11 or more"

"3808",559887125,"I’ve been a loyal Ibotta user for four years. I haven’t used the app for a few months because we had our second baby earlier this year, and we can barely get it together enough to make it to the grocery store at this point. I received an email today letting me know that my account had been deactivated for violating the terms of use. I’m not sure how that would have happened when I can’t even remember the last time I opened the app. I’m waiting for a response to an inquiry to their customer service team, but I’m pretty unhappy with this turn of events. I’ll stick with savings apps that don’t bring unnecessary stress into my life."
"3809",559887125,"I love this app!  I have made nearly $300 in 6 months and it is so easy.  The bonuses are awesome, too!"
"3810",559887125,"Excellent helpful service people."
"3811",560372072,"I played this game religiously for the last two months.  Started playing for real $$ about 3-4 weeks ago and enjoyed playing.  For over a week now, each and every time I start a match the system glitches.  Reached out to support 8 times and received 8 responses asking me to identify the match # or my opponent but the matches never got past a freeze screen and I had no way to provide what the tech agents were asking for.  I was told to trick the system by using a volume button pattern and even after I did this, copied and pasted it to an external email, no fix but my actual $$ was gone because they charge 10% of the match price when you “tied”.  It was my favorite app of the year now I believe it’s just a scam.  Just for the aggregation they should refund my entire deposit.  Asked for a phone cal to explain the glitch but they are not offering “phone support” at this time.  Play the game and have fun for “Z” tickets but DO NOT give them your money if you want to “Win”.  The company profits 20% per match.  Multiply this SMALL fee time 1,000’s and you can all do the math.  Hope you have a better experience than me.  I’m very unhappy.   ...all over $2.00 prompted me to write this.  Never written a review like this in my life.  Good luck."
"3812",560372072,"When it locks I lose my points with no chance to play.  Worked great until now ..."

"3814",560586497,"This app is great in concept, and I’ve really tried to use it, but there is no way to move the interface to the right side of the screen, which means frequently bumping different buttons and icons with the wrist and palm as a left handed person, which completely kills any chance of every getting into a work flow in this app. It does have some features that apps like Procreate do not, but Procreate does account for left-handedness, so I will just stick with that. :/  Updated: The developer responded to my issue of left-handed support and turns out I just wasn’t looking in the right place haha! Upgraded my review accordingly since this app has since been great for drafting out ideas for everything from web projects to 3D prints. The way the canvas can keep expanding and be rotated is amazing. No more trying to squeeze a bunch of details into the constraints of a single page!"
"3815",560586497,"Best app for drawing!!!!!! Thank you!!!!"
"3816",560586497,"One problem I’ve often found in many drawing and painting programs, as well as on paper and canvas, is that I tend to have issues with initial sketching.  Something about the process has always felt, somewhat claustrophobic to me, if that makes sense?  What with not knowing exactly how the finished piece will turn out, it begins to feel more and more cramped as more is added to the canvas.  This app, however, completely gets rid of that feeling for me, and allows me to just continue to sketch on and on to my hearts’s content, without any feeling that I'm running out of space, and then allows me to export my sketches, from which I can then continue and finish them in another program (though, it does seem like you may be able to create good finished pieces here as well, if that better suits your workflow!)  Thank you for this wonderful app!"

"3825",561521557,"We stopped playing it, because you have to watch your opponent play twice in pass and play. We both watch the screen during the move, so we see it happen and then it reviews it again!!! There’s no option to skip the review of your opponent’s turn. Why? WHY?!! It makes this unplayable. It got so annoying that we just moved on to other games."

"3829",561632513,"When trying to get a ticket transferred, I clicked on a link in the browser to open up the ticket in my app. I was presented with a modal where the primary action was “validate”. I clicked it, read the warning alert, and wasn’t 100% sure if it was saying that Only the ticket owner could validate the ticket, or only the staff could validate it. At any rate I wanted to see my ticket show up on my list. I closed the modal but the list was empty and there was no record of it anywhere in the app. This made me worried, so I went back to the browser to repeat my steps. I figured I must have read the validate modal wrong the first time, and perhaps that it was actually I that had to do that to add it to my list. I did that, and quickly realized no, that just made the ticket unusable. It sill didn’t show up on my list...   After I rebooted the app a couple minutes later it finally showed up in my list.

"3832",561941526,"I like this game because it’s addictive"
"3833",561941526,"This game is somewhat addicting but also very annoying. There are often competitions where you need to accomplish things but you get to a point where you can no longer accomplish things without spending gems. There is no indication whatsoever as to when this will occur or when you will be eligible to go further. It is quite rediculous and completely unexplained! They really need to fix this aspect of the game. An example is you have to collect food 6 times. It only lets you collect 5 times then you can collect as much as you like and it won't count it for no given reason. This is extremely annoying and I absolutely hate this aspect of the game!!"

"3845",563027226,"The cards and collections concept is awesome, cards are appealing and some are more rare than others. However ive been playing it over the years and you used to be able to get coins through downloading apps and completing different FREE tasks, but now the tasks ask you to spend money, sign up for something or watch a video that isnt even worth the time because they give so little coins. So essentially there is no way for you to get cards outside of logging on each day for 10,000 which is only 5-10 cards depending on what you choose. The app is trash unless you want to spend money on virtual cards that one day will cease to exist."
"3846",563027226,"I downloaded this game and proceeded to open some packs with my starting coins. I opened the packs and to my amazement I received a very cool looking card that was very rare (less than 130 in game)! I was very happy to have gotten this card so I decided to “save it” by connecting my gmail account. Upon doing so I was met with the unfortunate truth that my account had been reset and I had lost that very valuable card. I instantly deleted the app and I will never play again.  0 out of 10 stars. You get the blessing of the NFLPA to make a game and you do this with it? Shame on you. Shame on you..."

"3860",563910324,"After using the desk top version of this I decided to download the app. I almost didn’t after reading reviews stating you had to pay for info on each vessel. After downloading I ran into the same issue, HOWEVER there is a super simple fix to see the vessel names/basic stats. For some reason the app does not default to this; but if you go to settings-map options- you will see “vessel names”, you just have to toggle that on and you will be able to see them for free. A few took a few minutes to update but overall it is working just as the desktop version does."
"3861",563910324,"Love this app because I can locate my husbands  Ship within just a few minutes without going Through his office."

If you do decide to add skins please don’t make them cost cash make then cost coins or gems or maybe even new currency kind of like when you put gems into the game."
"3863",564540143,"Love this game had it off and on for years now at one point had everything maxed but lost all of my stats some how when I transferred phone but still love the challenge. But this isn’t my real issue, I love the game mechanics but is there some way of making it somehow optional about the gas and brake pedals being well more like real gas and brake pedals I’ve noticed that In some levels or when on inclines like the caves or others that you need more control of how fast you go or how hard you stop, sometime I give it all gas and the car flips over  and when I tap on the gas I can’t get the boost where I think it needs to be at to get up the hill, but enough of me criticizing still going to play if you do or don’t do this but I really really hope you do.

"3872",564874986,"It’s such a simple yet such a fun game, I’ve had it on every iphone I’ve owned. It’s so fun to go back and beat my high scores. Looking forward to backflip madness 2!"
"3873",564874986,"It is absolutely amazing to me that even after around 2 years of playing this game I am still overcoming new obstacles. This game is EXTREMELY difficult and at sometimes just downright annoying, but that’s what always kept me coming back and playing again. The main campaign of this game has you backflipping in a unique control scheme that is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before, and there are different unlockable poses that can help you with your backflip, or challenge you. With the added bonus of the ability to “combo” your positions together allows for what seems like infinite fun. I actually managed to discover how to do a double flip without needing any platforms to jump off of other than the ground with the awesome physics engine that this game has. Also, if you’re not that into challenge, you can try out the free play mode that lets you experiment with any stage, without lives or basically any restrictions. You can even go into a secret MOON GRAVITY MODE if you tap the screen enough times! And this game basically never crashes, for me, at least, and I’m using a super old iPad that I just keep updating. On the very small chance that anyone reads this, if you like video games at all, just get this game. It may seem difficult at first, but when you get the hang of it, you open up an entire universe of new possibilities and fun."

I can purchase them separately for $6. Are you trying to rip people off??? Or is this just a glitch in the programming????"

Monkey Math School Sunshine and Monkey Word School Adventure.. are the best games out there.. and they are both in this inexpensive bundle..   My daughter devoured these 2 apps when she was little and now she tutors other kids in math and can read easily at age 7. My other child is 3 and is constantly doing math and writing letters.. I know these games makes them crazy excited to learn..  It's super fun and my children earn fish and other prizes for a virtual aquarium.. (That I even love to play with..)   Just trust me on this!

"3895",567008119,"I’ve played around a bit with this program and my initial thoughts are very positive! When I first opened e-Sword HD and switched over to study mode I was impressed with the layout and the amount of information at my fingertips. Navigating to other resources is simple from the main screen which I love. I’m sure it is at this screen I’ll spend most of my time. The app comes with a number of great resources free to download and some paid ones but they are not really needed but it is nice they are offered. I did want to get some of my devotionals in here from Donald Fortner. I was thrilled to find a program on the e-Sword site which converts e-Sword PC modules to Apple modules. With what seems like thousands of free modules at BibleSupport.com you can perform some serious bible study with this iPad app. And I now have my daily devotional books from Fortner available for free in the app! If there was any draw back it would have to be the lack of ability to export my notes to e-Sword on my PC which I’ll need to make the full switch from Logos. Looking forward to using this program as it continues to mature."
"3896",567008119,"This is a simple and basic electronic Bible. The e-sword company is putting all their energy into their desktop application and have done an acceptable job porting their work to the iPhone and iPad.  One thing that is lacking, and thus the 4 stars, is that there is no documentation or explanation on how to use the mobile apps.  For example, there is a “Bible study” screen that puts various books in windows on the iPad screen. This is great.  However there is no way to know that the books are, or how to change the books. If I want a different Bible or commentary, there does not seem to be a way to change them.  If there is a way, it is hidden, since, as I said, there I no help built into this app."
"3897",567008119,"Great app just needs a few things like a concordance and the orthodox study Bible other than that it’s perfect"

"3899",567141387,"The app is cool except the the frequent and long annoying advertisements of the developers other apps. Makes this impossible to use. Typically, when you pay for an app, this one was 99cents, you’re not plagued with advertisements. I can’t even find a setting to remove without getting advertised to. Why would I ever want to give a developer like this my business. Will now attempt to get my 99cents back from Apple. It’s the principle. Do not buy this app. You’ll be sorry."

"3901",567143224,"I don’t have a lot to say about this game other than that as a tarot and tarocchi fan, it’s very well-done and a regular for leisure time on my iPad. The $4.99 paid version is absolutely worth it over the free version, but play the latter yourself a bit first so you can get a feel for what you’re buying."
"3902",567143224,"Very good game with good AI choices except for the following happening even in expert mode. - when the caller puts down the 21, the partner should always put down the petit if he has it, it’s the ambulance. It baffles me the number of times we have lost the petit recently. - when you play 5 people and call a king, the default should be for the partner called to put his king down the first time the color is played, not keep it to try to steal points in the future. Very frustrating to lose the called king over half the time. Thanks"

I would throw it through the window if it would do me any good.  I am SO ANGRY right now. It’s wasting my time and money to mess with this stupid SIM card & so-called service plan.  NEVER AGAIN will I use EE. Worse than awful."
"3905",567457151,"To add extra data, EE gives you the option of texting their number or going to their website. Their text menu has prices ridiculously higher than their website. The website asks you to turn off WiFi to access the website where you can buy data add-ons. Then when you try to buy a data add-on the website asks you to turn back on your WiFi. Obviously, because the website can only be accessed without WiFi on, following the websites instructions causes the connection to the add-on page to be lost.  I finally just downloaded the EE app to get the add-ons there...the add-on page isn’t on the app yet!! Is EE trying to scam me into buying the expensive text-menu add-ons? I feel incredibly insulted and would rather deal with the hassle of buying a new SIM card than dealing with this crap."

"3911",567767430,"Finally an app that I actually use. Lots of routines to choose from, great for beginners too. THAT WAS THEN.   All my saved routines disappeared after updating, think I got some back with restore and reloading. Not happy to see so much more advertising and a push for subscription. Does not look to be worth it.  Too bad!  Update Sept 2019. Think I got back most free classes. Decided to try the trial subscription, not very impressed. No interest in hip hop, meditation. I like Rodney Yee, but his few classes are short, and suddenly springs need for props at you part way through. Any physical class I took had us select our props before class starts. Do not really feel subscription is worthwhile, but am somewhat afraid of losing all content if I cancel. Recent reviews do not sound promising."

You start off with 5 hearts and every time you get something wrong you lose a heart. When you lose all your hearts you can’t learn anymore. That’s doesn’t make any sense to me? If you get something wrong on your homework you don’t stop learning or your work is taken away and you get a zero. That’s not how that works.

For example I have like 800 pairs of the same skinny jeans. That’s a exaggeration ofc but i think if we’re gonna buy a box that cost 45+ diamonds we should at least get something from that box not something we already have or we can easily get."
"3955",571640421,"This game is my favorite horror mobile game and it's also very nostalgic to me. I was wondering if I could somehow find the audio of the piano in the title screen because it's so nostalgic to me and I'd love to listen to it on loop"
"3956",571640421,"it’s a nice game I played the free version but then I thought that maybe the paid version will support iPhone X so I got the paid version but I was wrong please make the game screen support iPhone X thank you."
"3957",571640421,"I wish that u can take control of slender and make a multiplayer matches this will make players want to play this game because it’s fun and scary! Anyways the graphics r amazing and the model of slenderman is realistic i hope the creater doesn’t delete this game because I just bought it."

"3962",572395608,"Hi"
"3963",572395608,"I’ve ate at Arby’s yesterday. Downloaded game today & did not receive the 50000 coins for free! How am I able to receive coins???"
"3964",572432485,"Pros:  - Visiting Town between chapters is entertaining and makes sense.  - Dialogue is expertly crafted, easily better than the ridiculous Japanese-English translation dialogue that plagued FE games - Character portraits and character personalities (so far) are mostly pretty great, with the ocasional hilariously “homemade” portrait - Special abilities on characters, including support bonuses boosts the depth of combat. Having an accuracy boost on the pathetically weak main character is especially welcome! - Big maps! Some might complain, about more tapping/clicking/turns to traverse, but big maps make battles feel epic!  Cons:  - Punishing EXP system (esp on expert). You will need to grind, especially with your main character, to get them strong enough to not get one shotted by enemy grunts   Tips (for noobs only):  - Exploit the arena. Revisiting town spawns new random arena match - Save your potions! Should be used in arena only - If you run out of potions for the arena, bring in your healer and do 2v2 matches vs. weak enemies to heal your injured units  - For best EXP gains, it is most effective to unequip your character weapon and wait for a weak enemy to attack (and hopefully miss) for 25 turns, OR attack with slow/weak weapons.  (Edit after response from Developers): Bumped up to 4 stars, since the punishing EXP system works as Devs intended!"
"3965",572432485,"I feel like it’s an incomplete game with some problems. You can only equip items once you are in a battle, can not upgrade units like upgrade an archer to a sniper, level ups don’t help much and the max level is only 20 witch I can reach pretty fast, and the story doesn’t seem so smooth and sometimes hard to understand. I do like how every character has a different face, we are able to train before we move onto the next chapter, there are different endings, and the different game play options was pretty neat. Overall it’s not really worth the price because of the problems and it’s not to different from some of the free tactics games on iPhone., but it was enjoyable."
"3966",572432485,"The biggest problem this game has is unit balance; The avatar/main lord has the combat ability of a piece of bread, and some units are way too good (i.e. Tatum). Also, magic feels a bit too good, since the enemy fire mags in chapter two often one shots most of your units. Still, I'm loving this game 👏"
"3967",572534490,"I'm addicted to this game!! I absolutely LOVE it!!! The only problem I have is that there's no swing on the playground! So I can't complete the ""missions"" because it's asking me to do things that involve the swing! Can y'all please fix this?! Apart from that, this game is awesome!"
"3968",572534490,"It’s a copie of kick the buddie"
"3969",572534490,"The game is glitched there’s no tire swing"
"3970",573516833,"The base game is ok but there is not much strategy involved, and the stacked random encounters ruin the game.   With the base game, you play four characters, each a different class. The base story line has 9 quests. They are endless random quests to do with different rewards and loot. The maps are essentially the same design and your characters skills are determined by your level and items. There isn’t much option for customization or strategy involved. Just collect the highest level items and hit them before they hit you.   At higher levels, any single random encounter can be as difficult as the end fight. Not great game design but I can accept it. Having 3 or more random encounters stack is really bad design and is just frustrating."
"3971",573516833,"Really appreciated the style and not a pay 2 win style of game. Fun strategy and enough randomization to keep one interested, over all a really great game."
"3972",573516833,"I’ve yet to hear any sound effects or music, I’ve found the option for SFX and music and turned them up but alas nothing. Still a fun game just not sure if I’m missing an element."
"3973",573859785,"I loved this game. Please bring it back!"
"3974",573859785,"Please bring this game back. It was the best"

It has everything I needs to log their workout, including cardio and stretches. It also has to chart your progress, and both a countdown timer and a set timer. The interface is intuitive, and streamlined, and it makes keeping track of your routines easy. Great purchase."
"3980",573916046,"Thank you for creating this wonderful app!"
"3981",573916046,"I created a workout and it won’t sync with my Apple Watch. I can’t even schedule a workout later in the week.  Poor functionality and I’m sorry I wasted my money on a useless app.  How can it have so many good reviews?"
"3982",574001818,"I’ve had the game for awhile before, and it had the tire swing in Playground, but getting a new phone and re-downloading there is no tire swing, love the game, if you could just fix it to complete the tasks, that would be amazing! Thank you!! 👏🏼👏🏼"
"3983",574001818,"Fast food is  glitch and same fish market , Candy shop ,haunted house  ,mines and glass    playgrounds swing is missed."

"3985",574123647,"This game is hella fun and have used it in gun wars with friends. I love the selection the info on the guns I just love it. But the problem is the option to do things like quizzes or download apps. I completed a quiz and it didn’t give me anything. They should also make a better way to get coins or lower costs of guns. Other than that the app is perfect"
"3986",574123647,"I try to buy stuff but it keeps saying connection error so I can’t buy stuff >:("

"3989",574375380,"The game is great but the game needs more planes like the dauntless and yak-7b and needs a assault game mode  where the rules are bomb the enemy base.please update the game with what all the reviews say whoever made sky gamblers storm raiders"
"3990",574375380,"Add apple juice please"
"3991",574641836,"Good"
"3992",574641836,"Upon opening the game it brought back memories of the arcade and countless quarters well spent. Good memories. Playing this game did not leave good memories. It's a direct port but the joystick controller is awful. I was cursing its existence from moment one. It's not good. I’m either crouching or just standing there pointing straight up. Shooting down a helicopter is incredibly difficult because the joystick has to be in just the RIGHT spot to move and shoot up at the same time. Lets not even discuss the metal slug. For a. .99 cent game I would be more forgiving. But for four dollars I am really disappointed. Hard to enjoy an arcade classic with bad controls. Just my two cents. Might just be me."
"3993",574641836,"The controls in this game are pathetically poor.  Don’t waste your time or money."

"3998",575147772,"Gets boring cause you gotta pay with your actual money for anything interesting or spend 24/7 playing the game for simple things. It’s cute tho and fun to play for a day if you’re extremely bored"
"3999",575147772,"So I have made many accounts over the years and why? Because I was never been able to make a username I always got a little code and also I was not been able to make a passcode.Next I one had broken files... only broken files through the whole update LIKE HECK I couldn’t even experiences it... also the chat should be for all ages not just for 13 or 12 year olds, some kids are responsible and can handle chat but I’ll get to that later.Now we say is the event duck it doesn’t even work. NOW we get into the responseablity (sorry I can’t spell) so here take the username free example It’s really unfair to the people who are good at making usernames at passwords and also people should chat at all ages and if you respond saying “but the chat is only for 12 (or 13) and up” then just improve the filters system by blocking out words like the f or h or... you know what I’m talking about. Last I’m saying the game is just straight up bordum I remember playing the fish game and I couldn’t reel up any fish even tho I was doing it correctly and I just have to visit people’s home to make money because doing it from games is impossible. So that’s all I have to say Bye! Also developers if you are reading this please make it better... I used to like it before the broken files update. So bye now!"

"4004",575487269,"Why does it start over whenever I land????"
"4005",575487269,"Why, just why are you making a game that makes you buy it and as soon as you get in and choose you plane you have to buy all the jets. YOU ALREADY GOT THE APP!! Stop making us users buy the app and then, ALL THE PLANES! Have you heard of X-Plane 10? You guys tried to copy it but failed. The devs themselves days try to copy the good good free games but make you pay. FOR A CRAPY COPY OF A GOOD GAME. Ipacs, I like that your trying, but I wasted two dollars on the CRAPYEST Flight Simulator EVER. Stop making stupid copys of Laramar’s game X-PLANE. So stop."

"4009",575658129,"My friend introduced me to this game and I loved it but I bought the daily gold pack for 5 dollars and it’s been 3 days and not 1 single gold pack has come daily. Hopefully It’s not bothering just me 🙃"

"4012",575781369,"nice game"
"4013",575781369,"Good game."
"4014",575781369,"so so"
"4015",575812869,"It’s a very good game ❤️ I used to play it when I was little but when I deleted it a few years ago, and now today, I was confused on why you had to play but all though it’s a very good game!"
"4016",575812869,"This is how it all started. I had a REALLY old iPad, and downloaded this game. I hadn’t played it for 4 years. I get rid of the iPad,and transfer All of my stuff onto the new one. I started playing and playing until I got really bored. Once u think about it, there aren’t many rooms to play in, and NOT a lot of pets. I thought “ wow” I thought it was better!"
"4017",575812869,"It"
"4018",576443892,"I have made all kinds of logos in this app really easy and simple to use"

"4020",576443892,"Easy to use with awesome results and they look professional"
"4021",576505181,"This game is a nice game to play if you play pokemon go but want something slightly different.   However. Be warned there are players who take this game way too seriously who have used the game to stalk or harass people into not playing the game. Niantic will do nothing about it if you try to report them.   If you can avoid those people. It can be fun"
"4022",576505181,"Horrible. The sonar makes it unplayable"
"4023",576505181,"I’m lovin’ this UI rebuild! Haven’t played in a few years and the reworking is just the thing this game needed to be completed, by my opinion. Great game, 5 stars"

"4028",576649830,"I am having issue scrolling down to look for some pictures and 2 seconds later the app closes on it own please fix it please.   The app is still closing when i scroll down for my pictures please fix it"
"4029",576649830,"Worthless! Downloaded to try to check out the “free” features it supposedly has. Never got to see any of the features they offer. Automatically goes to a Premium upgrade page and gives you no way around it without signing up for the trial period.  No thanks!"
"4030",576836614,"I bought Squidward’s fancy outfit and suddenly a wide Squidward with a smug face popped up telling me something about toffee. 10/10 game, would recommend, please make this a feature, because I need more wide Squidward in my life."
"4031",576836614,"Why did the game just freeze on me, I just opened this app and I got to level 4. After that the game has been frozen! Everywhere I tap bubbles appear but it won’t let me make anything and nothing else pops up... I’m frustrated now!"
"4032",576836614,"One of my favorite games to play. Something to keep me busy when I need to pass time and love SpongeBob. But I’m constantly running into bug issues. It’ll crash on me randomly and kick me out. Add more time to builds because of it. I have never been able to view my inventory. It’ll quickly say loading and then it’s empty. But I’m constantly adding things from the shops. So I know I have inventory. Just don’t know what I have!"

"4034",576939960,"This game is awesome, the developers had done an amazing job on this one. Cool graphics, plenty of levels and this game keeps you pulled in sort of speak. It is addictive and you can get lost in it for hours.   Great work and looking forward to the next one."
"4035",576939960,"Come on update please!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars When you send out updates   Thank you for no update !!!!!!!!! Do you guys even read this ? Do you guys even care ? Over year now and still no update !!!!!!!!!!!"
"4036",576959436,"This game is incredibly creative. The levels are nice and it's easy to modify Quozzle."
"4037",576959436,"This is a really good game. I can tell a lot of care went into this game. I'm having a blast playing, and I'm just at the beginning! This is a mix of spore and happy wheels. Except with a lot more thought put into it."
"4038",576959436,"The game is ok but NOT WORTH $4 it's a waste this should be free not paid the levels are boring and the game is kind of hard to understand"

Nothing wrong with my email functions or server.  Now I remember why I deleted app."

"4048",577499909,"Downloaded in the beginning of August. Experienced multiple instances of phone connection problems, strange sounds on calls, etc. Sept. 10th someone used my checking info to initialize a small transaction from my bank. Yesterday, another $2 charge and then $350.   I got a new checking account Less than three months ago, and I believe this app likely was the security culprit that leaked my information obtained through call recording, or accessing downloaded bank statements.  Be careful."
"4049",577499909,"This application said I had a free trial period of one (1) week, as it never worked for me. I canceled the subscription before twelve (12) hours and I had already made a charge on my credit card for $ 10.99"
"4050",577499909,"This app worked great until it didn’t. Calls won’t merge."
"4051",577586159,"ATT I believe in change and improvements.  But every 1-3 years, you keep making this app worse.  Now I can barely see.  Leave it alone will ya.  Stop fixing what is NOT broken."
"4052",577586159,"Since the update, I’ve received notifications for messages and have them been unable to locate the actual messages. They’ve literally disappeared and are not in any folder. Not sure what’s going on, but I’ve missed some important emails."
"4053",577586159,"Stop sending"
"4054",577628510,"This app’s overall functionality is terrible. It’s extremely clunky. Many great features are in the Android version, but not in the iOS version."

"4058",578186621,"Good"
"4059",578186621,"Make sure I get my tickets paid. Since the new camera system in China"
"4060",578203499,"Better than the $1 version as I can build cool looking bridges that pass the stress test and spend as much as it takes to do it.  In the paid version you are budget restricted. Nuff said. I agree.  Love it!"
"4061",578203499,"This game is not worth buying.  It was fun, but it was basically some of the same levels over and over again.  The amount of levels were also disappointing.  I finished the game after only a couple of days.  I only spent about an hour of total time. If it was a free game,  it would be worth getting it,  but with this price tag, you will be disappointed."
"4062",578203499,"This game is a lot of fun and it is realistic."
"4063",578448682,"On the level with the exploding car you can’t skip the intro. Super annoying"
"4064",578448682,"ITS SO COOL U CAN TURN INTO A ANIMAL AND SKY DIVE AND SWIM!"
"4065",578448682,"This is a very nostalgic game for all the right reasons. It plays a bit different from the PlayStation 2 days but after a few missions you’ll be cruising through vice city in no time. This is definitely worth the $5 and for all you GTA fans it a must have. ❤️🎮"
"4066",578665578,"Cool interface, and solid security protection from remote devices accessing information. I would recommend that they create a burn on read feature similar to wickr that deletes messages as they are read. Good protection unless someone has access to your physical device."
"4067",578665578,"App is also freezing since last update. Why do y’all keep screwing with it. Please add full Apple Watch support. This freezing is really messing with my system btw"
"4068",578665578,"Your app revelaed the biggest political scandal in the Slovak Republic history. All you need is to break inside (it took police some months to do it - you might work on more secure standards) of one of the biggest influential oligarchs who used it for long time. Now all Slovakia could read the messages and reveal the biggest political and economical thefts made by politicians, oligarchs, mobs. So big thank you for liberating our country. (all in the news last two weeks)"
"4069",579446739,"Nice app very helpful, and easy"
"4070",579446739,"The Sign Off problem that was introduced in the previous version (2.261) has been corrected in version 2.264.  The app no longer displays a gray screen after signing off."
"4071",579446739,"Never had a problem with this app until the last update. Now I can’t sign off. When I hit “sign off”, the screen goes grey. I wait, but there is never a verification that I have been signed off. I have to close the app and go back on to see if I am truly signed off. Some times I am and sometimes I am not. If I’m not signed off, I shut down my iPad completely and then boot up again. Please check into this as I am a bit afraid to use the app until this is fixed."
"4072",579581125,"I’ve used this app for years, always loved it. It was nice to get away from all the ridiculous media coverage channels out there and see individual articles. However lately, the term “breaking news” seems to be exaggerated. I used to get the notifications for “breaking news” and it would be a key world event for a famous death. Last week I got a notification titled “Breaking News: Kylie Jenner Poses for Playboy.” How is that breaking news? I’ve had my notifications turned off except for the 3pm update. 2 years ago I’d get one breaking news notification every few days. I now get at least 4 daily. Almost all are complete garbage social media articles about celebrity feuds or some other insignificant event."
"4073",579581125,"Hopefully this gets put in with iOS 13"
"4074",579581125,"The default news articles are clearly liberal.  At least admit it rather than lie. Just because I can hunt around and add Fox News does not make it a balanced site."
"4075",579712380,"This app now gets one star because no matter how many times I rate it, the app keeps periodically popping up and asking me to rate it.  To make things worse, I actually paid for this app. I could almost see the nagging if it was the free version."
"4076",579712380,"Love the ambient sounds and especially the brain wave activity they really help me sleep soundly. I do wish I could change the ambient sounds for the wake cycle so they are different from the sleep cycle. Over all I do defiantly recommend this app."
"4077",579712380,"Yes you can overlay it to your playlist. But can’t control the music volume. Could use a playlist feature for the ambient sound"

"4080",580175049,"I remember playing this a lot. I logged into my account and found out none of my progress was saved. I lost years of progress. I don’t know why they deleted by stuff"
"4081",580765736,"This would be a fantastic game but it’s not possible to do anything because of the cost. You have to upgrade EVERYTHING multiple times (the highest I’ve seen so far is 8), and the megabucks it takes increases exponentially each time. You need megabucks for everything. EVERYTHING. Sure, you could use supplies to upgrade, but where do you get them?? You buy them with megabucks! It’s ridiculous. You can watch a video every 4-8 hours to get THREE supplies...at that rate it will take months to upgrade just one building. This is the most expensive game I have ever seen. They sell FOUR megabucks for .99 (and that’s what they call a 55% EXTRA DEAL!!)...those will get you absolutely nowhere. It’s extremely obvious the developers of this game are GREEDY. I play other games that I happily spend money on, but the developers also give a lot for free. Absolutely not the case with this one."

"4122",582719476,"The workouts section contains routines that   Sequence exercises in a variety of ways. Still, you can’t create an automatic custom routine like in other apps that don’t require a monthly subscription, neither do the workouts change automatically as you progress from a beginner to other levels. I will give then that fact that the include resistance bands, bodyweight and dumbbell routines. Check out the Lolo and the Daily workout apps."

"4124",582790430,"Absolutely terrible customer service worst ticket business I’ve ever worked with. Over priced fee charges at check out. And competition has better prices"
"4125",582790430,"Would give a 0 if I could. Worst ticket experience at a sporting event I’ve ever had.   The ticket I purchased showed up on the app, but with no barcode. So when trying to get into the nfl stadium they would not let me in.   After calling and chatting with customer service to get me into the game, I was consistently put on hold and told to “go to the box office to pick up your ticket” when I repeatedly told them I was at the box office and there was no ticket for me and they would not let me into the stadium without a barcode.   I found out my ticket had a “barcode” error. And so it wasn’t showing up. So there’s nothing I or the stadium could do for me.   I ended up standing outside the stadium for an hour and missing the entire 1Q plus more of the game before my friend had to leave his seat and come to me to convince the gate I actually had purchased a ticket and the company (SeatGeek) was having technical difficulties.   I have been reaching out to customer service for a couple days for a refund or anything, and have not gotten a reply yet.   Overall experience: 0/5 Customer service: 0/5"

"4139",583308290,"Worked well for about five minutes then would freeze. You’re also kind of forced to buy it for no ads, otherwise just ads popping up all over the place.  Even then, would not work correctly..just freeze after the scan. Disappointed the kids as they were excited to get scanned."

"4150",583976519,"Cubasis — I guess it’s an ‘app’, but it feels like a real heavy duty piece of software.  Lay out many tracks of audio & midi, use built in sounds & synths, and expand with plugins & samples.  If a sample is a different tempo, time stretch & pitch shift it to fit.  Reminds me a lot of when I first encountered Ableton Live (way back in v4) and I thought, “This is exactly what I want!”  Thank you Steinberg - for some people, this is all they will need to make music, record their vocals, add effects, make a pro mix, and export."
"4151",583976519,"Picked up this app about two weeks ago and have really come to grips with the interface. It’s a powerful piece of software that allows for really easy experimentation and integration/connecting of many different apps including midi generators and AU3 and IAA units.   Lots of routing options allow for some mental combinations. Love using midi generators to control things like the built in drum machines and then recording the midi output.  Playlist is smooth, and zoom is fluid. Would love to see them add: -Time markers -Ability to rearrange tracks (update: added) -Group track lanes into folders that can collapse to help free up small screen space -Song sections to quickly rearrange song parts (intro, verse, etc).  Also something is off with the piano roll. I often find myself either accidentally drawing a note when trying to pinch to zoom, deleting a note when trying to move it, and not drawing a note because the draw button reset back to off position. Other than that the piano roll itself is fluid."

"4160",584927317,"Love the games I think it needs to add more units like a new tank or mortar but besides that I love your game. You should watch include JoJo reference JK"
"4161",584927317,"Love the game; great mechanics; strong AI, and interesting/replay able puzzles. I also enjoy playing against others, and sort of like the simplicity of interactions or more like lack of them, which leads me to the following: not a lot of people are playing, so hard to get a Good/Strong opponent. Also, there is no leaderboard and from what I have read from developers there might not be whole a lot of support due to lack of funding. I would love for the game to reach its full potential, as interest in turn based games is there, just some minor tweaks and probably some investment into getting server storage for better profile, statistics and leaderboards to be available. Anyway, thank you for a great game as is, I am certainly enjoying it.  ...why cant I post this? Is there a lag? Argh"

"4169",585307861,"I love this app! It has all the basic editing tools you need plus preset filters. It’s incredibly easy to use. Most importantly you can save the editing recipes you build and even more importantly you can easily apply your edits to multiple photos - a lifesaver when you have tons of photos that need adjustments. I have tried so many photo editing apps but this is the one I almost always use."
"4170",585307861,"Highly recommended. Won't post anything before improving it with this app."

"4172",585512923,"I downloaded this game on my iPod touch for my 4 year old brother; he loves it and plays it all the time! (Even I play it sometimes. I'm 11.) This game is his favorite of all the Dr. Pandas. The graphics are really nice and you kind of have to figure out what to do on your own. It's great for toddlers and preschoolers, and it teaches them a lot. The other day my brother said, ""Hey let's plant this strawberry in a pot like on the planting game!"" 🐼"
"4173",585512923,"My 3 girls (2.5, 4, 6.5) all love it!!"

"4177",585801479,"At the time I downloaded this application, I paid for it.  One time payment.  Now I see that was a scam, if I am to continue using this app I will have to pay again and and again.  Crooked!!"
"4178",585801479,"On May 6, 2019 I paid 29.99 to help you poor souls out because Google was squeezing you. Where is it? I paid for it and I expect it! F*** Facebook! How do I get what I paid for?

"4181",585880277,"I paid to get the full version my 2 year old loved it so much! He picked up on it quick after some trial and errors but loves it!! And the best part it's educational!"

"4197",586280100,"Leveling is hard!! I keep dying!! MAKE THIS GAME EASIERRRRRRRR OMGJJJ"
"4198",586328581,"Cancelled through iTunes, but that didn’t stop my subscription.  No one will help me.  They just respond with copied and pasted generic answers.   I canceled it from their website but have not received confirmation of the cancellation.  Also I am being charged an extra $4 per month that I never authorized for something called “assessment”.  I wanted to do their free trial, but it has cost me.  Update: I emailed them at the link they sent and they offered a 90 day refund.  At best that will be $40 but it has cost me hundreds because they send no receipts, no notification of billing...    And I asked them about their policies, why not at least notify people?  and they did not respond.  The only reasonable assumption I can make is that they do not care if people use and benefit from the product.  Only want to make money?    I asked them to look and see if we have even logged into our account recently.  Haven’t heard anything back."
"4199",586328581,"You know what to do right?"
"4200",586328581,"I registered for this app to see if my 3 kids would find any enjoyment in the learning they provide. While the exercises themselves are mostly fine, the application itself is a horrible design. It’s clunky, it crashes all the time (I had to restart it EVERYTIME I opened it), and signing up for an account is a joke.  I registered for a free trial and instead, they charged me THAT DAY for the full amount. I requested a refund and they have thus far denied those requests.   This app/company shouldn’t have made it passed Apple’s App Store standards.  Do not buy! Pick one of the dozen other apps for child-learning."

"4202",586447913,"I just took my headphones out and without diving in too deep, I find it troublesome that your app can’t remember me when the WiFi is off. Sometimes it’s nice to enjoy the breeze. No I’m not speaking of the airplane... it’s the breath of fresh air I receive when I shut out the noise. Use your imagination. Doesn’t a computer have the capability to keep track of its own password?   - Casey Hayes 🙃"

"4219",587823548,"Update 9/6/2019 - I emailed support and they explained that it was a bug that caused the issue. They made an update to my account and now everything is working. Very quick and friendly response and resolution to the problem.  Original review - I no longer have the ability to put in 2 videos on the same day, nor to extend videos beyond 1 second, which is what I paid for originally. Same thing happened several months ago when there was a update as well...."
"4220",587823548,"very sad that they took away the 1.5 second options and to add a second snippet option. i paid for this app too, didn’t know there was a free version. oh well, i guess i’m done with my 1 second a day. it was fun while it lasted for many years past."

"4226",587849880,"It worked for one picture and it worked great but now when I try to edit a photo, I get a black screen and it crashes and takes me back to my home page🤦🏽‍♀️ what a waist of 99 cents"
"4227",587849880,"Every time I try to import a photo from my library I get a black screen,  this app is useless to me."
"4228",587868848,"The app works great, very user friendly. It would be nice to have single out option, as well as pre-selecting Double or Treble before scoring each dart."
"4229",587868848,"I have to agree with others about the lower DartBots' bullseye accuracy. He can go multiple rounds without hitting anything. If it's down to bulls, he gets at least one if not two every round."
"4230",587868848,"The concept of this app is nice, but for $5 you would expect some actual nuance to the algorithm of the “dartbot” opponent. Dartbot always hits it’s doubles, and it fills up the bullseye as easy as the 20s or 16s when playing cricket. This makes the app unbalanced, unrealistic, and wildly frustrating.

"4232",587922128,"I think this app is great, but . . . I have an issue now that infuriates me.  I purchased Premium and am paid up through Sept. 2019.  The app kept freezing and so I uninstalled and reinstalled it.  Now I’m getting the ads and I can’t track the “Checks” (water, etc.).  When I go to “upgrade to Premium” it acknowledges that I am on Premium but I still can’t work the app as though I actually AM on Premium.  I have gone to Support several times and have gotten NO RESPONSE.  Maybe this rating will get a response.  Helloooo??? Is anybody there?"

Now I have to spend 22,000 on a GOLD CHAIN, which is meant for like levels 20 TO 30 alpacas. And I know that because this my 4th time creating a farm on this app, since I just got a new phone. Right now I’m only a Rookie, with not even 2,000 coins. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BUY A 22,000 COIN ROPE?! This has never happened before. I’m almost certain a FIBER ROPE should be able to capture a level five. Or at least a Kernmantle rope. Why is this app like this now?? It was was fine my past 3 times playing it and I loved it!!

I had a Jack and Rose which costed 100 seeds then the plant died even though I fed it water and then the apps only option for a 100 seed plant was to bury it not get any seeds back. So basically it vanished and I had to get a new plant I had already had before"
"4262",590216134,"This is a cute little app. I like the animation and the variety of plants and pots. What I don’t like is that you cannot go back and add water you have missed. I often forget the last water of the day or to track it on weekends. So I have “killed” several plants! So it is discouraging, rather than encouraging. If adding missing water to the previous day were fixed, I could make this a 5 star app!"
"4263",590216134,"I love the idea of this app, but it’s annoying you can’t add different amounts you drink, like 8 oz one time and 16 another, you have to go into the settings to change it. Also wish I could set a mor realistic amt to drink bc I simply can’t physically drink that much."

We successfully taught him the alphabet over 2 weeks when he was about 20 months old using an alphabet book but then he became very resistant to practicing letters.  This was the fourth alphabet app I downloaded (and the 3rd or 4th different modality tried) and it’s worked like a charm!  He now asks for the alphabet game as opposed to throwing the phone or book or flash card or paper in defiance.  I’m very grateful.  Can’t recommend it enough.  Genuinely seems to make learning the alphabet fun."
"4279",591840203,"I’ve been using this to-do app for over a year now, and while it has been effective, a year later I’ve grown tired of the constant nagging and snarky comments to motivate me (I used to be more amused by them, but am now weary of them). And so I’m going back to another to-do app that I liked and used in the past.  My biggest wish with this app, which still has not been granted, even though I emailed the developer regarding it about 10 1/2 months ago, was to set windows of time that are off limits to CARROT, such as for when I’m sleeping or working, during which times I’m not able to complete tasks in my to-do list. I received a response saying this was a good idea for a future upgrade, but that was many months ago, and the functionality still hasn’t been added (I read another user’s review that echoed similar sentiments). I just find it disappointing that I get CARROT in a good mood by completing a bunch of tasks and later find CARROT in a bad mood because of time I was not able to spend completing tasks due to the need for getting sleep or working at my job, which in my opinion is not fair. I really hope the developer adds this ability in a future update."
"4280",591840203,"Can’t really do much without leveling WAY up! This is more for amusement than actual getting anything done. You can’t schedule due dates or times, or schedule repeat reminders. And while the app will sync levels across devices, it does not sync tasks so that isn’t helpful. Unless you are turned on by poking ocular sensors and hearing Carrot’s droll, gravelly, 2 pack a day voice just use iOS reminder app or get something like Appigo’s ToDo Cloud"

I tied sending 5 pics five different times and not one came through, even though the screen said it did. The option on the app that asks to delete the sent photos? Better make sure they came through first or you may be sorely disappointed. Before today, I would have given 5 stars. Today, sadly, only one since I cannot review without tapping a star....."

"4288",592682163,"This is a very fun and addictive game, I am a curler and I get very annoyed with the game because some of the rules are wrong, you need to add hammer rules and the order should rotate between teams instead of you throw 2 and then they throw 2. There are always room for new mini games, I feel like that would greatly increase of the popularity due to many winter games instead of just 8, here are some possibilities- half pipe, figure skating, bobsleigh, skeleton, and freestyle."
"4289",592682163,"If you are playing curling and after three rounds you draw, the opponent gets to throw last three times as oppose to your one."

"4316",594851821,"Overall the game is worth playing, there are hints available if you really cannot figure stuff out, but prepare to have many game overs.   It would be neat to understand more of why I need to do each thing for different types of bombs (some classes available after the first couple levels?)."
"4317",594851821,"The designers of this game assume that you are a bomb expert and know which wires to cut or what to do. There is no tutorial phase and it just throws you right into the game. The only “how to play” that there is only explains the tools you are given. In my opinion it is not worth the money spent to buy it."

"4347",597426372,"It doesn’t work at all, at any delay time I could speak fine. Might just be my headphones though."
"4348",597855590,"Overall, this is a great game. There are some things that could be improved. 1. Whenever I click restart after doing a game in ""single"" mode, most sounds disappear, sometimes all of them. 2. A countdown would be appreciated on all events that involve a time, rather than starting abruptly. 3. The glitch that bothers me the most is when I'm on online mode, the backboard displays a flawless basket, the ball clearly misses. The basket also counts as a flawlessly basket.   Other than the graphics' quality, this is a really enjoyable game to play."
"4349",597855590,"I love the way you make some modes easy and sometimes hard keep up the good work and it will pay off 😃😃😃"
"4350",597855590,"Very fun game can play it for hours"
"4351",597986893,"Best game ever best best best. Love PvZ the whole series. But there should be a few more worlds to play in like a space one or a World War world. Also their should be a pickle plant and egg plant plant. Thanks for your time. Bue"
"4352",597986893,"Great game to play but they ruin it with ads, most you have no choice but to watch, going to delete this game, do not download unless you like wasting your life away"
"4353",597986893,"Please update plants vs zombies2 By September 27TH Thank you"

"4363",598581619,"The game and gameplay is great, ironhide is one of the best game studios I've ever seen. But i do have one question, whats the difference between frontiers and frontiers HD? I found that a long time ago i bought HD on my old iPad and now i can download it for free, but what's the difference? I wanted to know wether or not i should buy the original frontiers or just keep hd?"
"4364",598581619,"My favorite strategy game for the meantime 😍"
"4365",598581619,"Great balance of simplicity and strategy. Love it."
"4366",598603610,"Dear, makers of CSR classics  Now don’t get me wrong I love this game but it would be nice to have more cars to choose from. One of my ideas is: NHRA cars down one notch  Would be a real pleasure to have this added to the game and it also goes around the drag racing concept.  P.s. keep up the work love this game;p"
"4367",598603610,"Does not give me the gold coins I earn when I complete a new level and when I got a new phone, all of the gold coins and money I had purchased with my credit card were gone and so was my tier 5 car. I had used my credit card several times to purchase stuff and all that is gone."
"4368",598603610,"Grateful game"
"4369",599083564,"Was a 5star app. My kid loved it until the last update. We cannot get a single book or game to work and I paid for the subscription. Not anymore. I will be deleting this app."
"4370",599083564,"I just think everyone is trying to make you cry to be mean"
"4371",599083564,"Apps keeps showing an update is available. Click to update and it only spins without downloading the update. Frustrating."
"4372",599456126,"Mine are awful and it's fun to see that in graph form."
"4373",599456126,"This app provides a wealth of sleep data at very little cost and NO subscription. Highly recommended!"
"4374",599456126,"Works very well."
"4375",599456380,"After updating to ios12 suddenly my phone over heat when using the app and the battery drains a lot faster."
"4376",599456380,"I LOVED this app. It was fabulous. Waking me in my lightest sleep, sometimes before my alarm. It was great! Since the ‘bug fix’ update last week, it crashes. Every. Single. Night. Luckily my husband gets up near to the same time I do. Otherwise I would have had no alarm the last 4 days. It shuts off completely in the middle of the night. Not cool."
"4377",599456380,"See the title"
"4378",599515468,"this game is awesome! but what bothers me the most! is that when you are done with all 14 levels, you have to either watch an add or buy a $6.99 game that will only last you 2 min! i just want to play games for my entertainment, not buy it! please see this illusion labs and take this as consideration...GOOOOOOOOODBYE! -A Frustrated Person ☹️"
"4379",599515468,"This was one of my favorite games on my phone so I love it but all of the levels should be free so everyone can enjoy it without having to pay so in the next upgrade that is what you should do🎀💙🙃"
"4380",599515468,"I love this game but I purchased all of the levels and they aren’t all available for me, it’s trying to have me repurchase"
"4381",599534650,"Save problem!!!!"
"4382",599534650,"Old version is better. Don't like it. Will have to look for something else."
"4383",599534650,"Used to be great, 5 stars (just don’t give it data and turn off WiFi when using to get rid of the watermark). Now when applying makeup, I can’t switch between lipstick, foundation, eyebrows, etc. why did you do this?"
"4384",599608562,"Ive been sending emails and hitting support and following through but my school is still not appearing on the list. I just wanna use the app."
"4385",599608562,"This is my first time ever signing up for this app and already I have been deactivated and “throttled”. I’ve just recently even heard of this app and yet I can’t access it even though my credentials as a student do check out??? I knew this was a scam from the get go and now I don’t stop getting spam mail from these people. Don’t get your hopes up. I know I won’t, I knew this was too good to be true when even ASOS stared I couldn’t sign up for a student discount even when I’ve been attending this college for a whole month now"
"4386",599608562,"For any college students I definitely recommend using this app for any type of purchase that allows you to use a student discount, saving every penny is worth it especially when you’re a college student. Even though there isn’t a lot of stores that offer student discounts on this app hopefully in the near future they add more stores. But I STRONGLY recommend using this app."

"4395",599852923,"EVERYTIME I GO TO THE DOOR AND TRY TO GO THE NEXT ROOM IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY TAKES ME OUT OF THE GAME. SO THEN WHEN I COME BACK I LOG IN BUT IT SAYS “it seems likes there’s a problem “ can u please fix this this just started happening"

"4401",600093661,"My kids loved it the first year we got it. I tried to delete app, because they no longer used it and it is $8/month. Even though I deleted app they still charged me! The kids decided they wanted to use it again so I tried to log on and it said my ‘trial period had ended.’ There is no phone number and no customer service agent because they are a ‘small company.’ I emailed to cancel and I am waiting for a response. It has been an additional year that I have paid $8/month and I can’t even use it. Rip off"

"4404",600273928,"就这一点给差评"
"4405",600626116,"I love this game and it reminds me of being in school just a few years ago but it won’t shut off. I have to completely shut my phone (iPhone X) to close the app. This is getting severely annoying."
"4406",600626116,"I give this game 4 stars because I love playing this game soo much and I remember playing it as a little kid but the only thing about it is that when you go to put the toppings on the burger you don’t have to drag the ketchup and cheese and stuff and that part of the game really ruins it for me eventhought that part was always hard for me as a kid, I really think you guys should fix this, I also think you guys should fix this on any other papas games you might have"
"4407",600626116,"I love this game I remember when I was in 6th-8th grade I’d always play this on. The computers in school I loved this game and now I’m in 11th grade I decided to get the game again and it’s definitely still the fun game I loved but there’s been a few problems like this may be hard to understand over text but , when I was playing the game the first person came in a took there order and served it but the person who received the burger was not one of the customers and after they took the burger I was still left with the receipt and the first customer, I thought that was very weird and as other ppl in the reviews have talked about the game freezes when u press the speed up button now I’ve had to replay the same lever over and over again my options are either press the speed button and hope it doesn’t freeze or wait for the red timer burger or what ever it’s called to cook and get horrible reviews on the waiting"
"4408",600674056,"I love this game!! One of my top favorites!!! 😀"
"4409",600674056,"i have been a fan for life i cant stop playing this thanks for the free coins"
"4410",600674056,"Fun!!"
"4411",601584735,"Wish I could love it.  But it crashes on a regular basis.   Please fix and I’ll make 5 stars"
"4412",601584735,"I played for a couple of hours and now it just crashes every time I try to play."
"4413",601584735,"So the reason I say was is THE GAME IS DEAD"
"4414",601831815,"I got this app years ago and played it once. So, the other day, I’m on hour 4 of a 6 hour plane ride, and I’ve listened to all the music and audiobooks I can tolerate. I’m scrolling through my phone looking for something new and I find this preposterous thing! Two hours later, my wife has to nudge me to say the plane has landed and I have to get off. She thought I’d lost my mind, all the more so when I tried to explain the premise of the game. The thing is, there is no barrier to entry. Any idiot can play instantly. But there’s a lot to learn - rolled out at just the right pace. And no jamming you up for money. What a breath of fresh air! And the humor in the game is just the greatest - no small part of its appeal. This is just perfect for withdrawing from the world yet retaining the ability to rejoin, reluctantly, if needed. The best!!!"
"4415",601831815,"I love this game but wish it was not small on my phone. Black bars all around."
"4416",601831815,"This is a great game but over time it is really difficult to avoid fish while going down and by the second level it is too hard I can’t even get past 200m!"
"4417",602065803,"$0.99? WHO CARES?! Not me. This is so much better than the original. I watched the video for Cover Orange 1, and the oranges didn't even have stems! It's sort of hard, but that's what makes it so good! Such an amazing game, and it must have been so hard to make. I played so much that I beat the game, but there are going to be new updates soon...RIGHT?!"
"4418",602065803,"I love this game but in some levels in is really hard"
"4419",602065803,"🤬"
"4420",602716057,"It could not be harder to use. It contacts me all the time about my refills. It says I have one ready to pick up. I get all my prescriptions started at the same time. Dr writes them all the same day. All are for 90 days with 3 refills so they should all be refilled at the same time, but that is not the case. I try to wait until I have a week’s worth left so I can get them all at one time.  When I go to the app it has no refills and I can’t refill without calling someone. What happened to the refills.  I use to use the auto refill but it sends things I don’t take anymore.  This app is no help. It just adds to my high blood pressure."
"4421",602716057,"What a hassle you guys just lost all info the app does no display. I am finally pushed to go elsewhere"
"4422",602716057,"What happened to the prescriptions that were pending on 7/31? They just disappeared = no messaging or communication.   Bad enough that CVS prescription insurance requires a 90 refill but CVS pharmacies do not have enough product to fill and use archaic delivery methods that take a week to restock, but then the refill request just disappears with no explanation.  Also, my account had been setup to receive text messaging for refills and status but on this app, all settings are set to no.  I didn’t change them.  There was also a new script for eye drops that were pending since 7/31 = gone with no explanation."
"4423",603527166,"it’s lit no cap"
"4424",603527166,"I beat the game just now and I loved it😸😸"
"4425",603527166,"Haven’t played in 5 years. Found it again in the App Store and still love it. How did I survive without???"
"4426",603529731,"We need more episode like beach to forest I have a new one in dino times there are 4 bosses 1 brachiosaurus and it shoots fire out its nostrils. 2nd boss is ankylosaurus witch has a fire club tail. 3rd boss is a triceratops witch has flaming horns (P.S it can shoot bombs out its snout horn) last boss is a t-Rex witch has flaming teeth and after all bosses defeated you have to STOP THE METEOR! It takes all the water you have then you defeated the game! (Also they all are made of stone and all have red eyes) thanks if you reply! Oh and great game I give it 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000stars and that much stars for the other games I like!"
"4427",603529731,"Definitely worth the money. Easy to understand. This game has actually tested my mind quite a bit while still being fun. No lag, no glitches, no problem. Again, love it!💖"
"4428",603529731,"Stupid and way too annoying."
"4429",605040858,"I homeschool my 9 year old and we travel often.  It was a pain to not be able to use her iPad for schoolwork because of the lack of flash.  This app has made our lives so much easier!  Now we barely have to sign onto the family computer (saving electricity) and can do schoolwork more comfortably."
"4430",605040858,"Love being able to get around not having flash on my iPad!"
"4431",605040858,"Something told me that an issue that big (pages not loading) would be taken care of quickly, especially if it is solved in another version. No luck. Don't waste your money"
"4432",605057245,"The game is great and a lot of fun but it will not allow me to connect to Facebook so I can’t add any friends seeing it only allows me to add them via Facebook..."
"4433",605057245,"Love this game so much it’s cute fun and amazing just great"
"4434",605057245,"Now I know this game is abandoned by the developers, but this is such an awesome game. I just downloaded it yesterday but I am hooked. I just wish the developers would come and make more of this game and add more because once I finish I will be so sad to see it end. I only found one problem and that was that is flooz super hard to get."
"4435",605477810,"Love the app.  Not a game, but nice simulator to test loads.   I shoot a fair amount of air rifles as well.  Request custom parameters be expanded to allow for single digit grain weight projectiles, fps to the low 100s, and include GA model ballistic coefficients.  Also, allowing for distances within 50 yards.  Thanks!"
"4436",605477810,"This game is trash.I bought this game for 4$ and you should bay use to play the game.I would even play the game if you baed me 400$.You can only shout at targets."
"4437",605477810,"You can move you just stand there the bullet isn’t even close to real your scope only looks one way you can look left or right and you pick what animal stands there and when you hit an animal it instantly falls over not worth $4"
"4438",606190854,"Chinese control who wins, who loses, and how many teammates from 1 country gang up on you. You are constantly battling tanks with more power than you. Why are tanks far more powerful fighting in my league?"
"4439",606190854,"It's a fun game however whenever it looks like I'm next to a prize I should get another tank comes in and gets it.  Something needs to be done to remedy this."
"4440",606190854,"Each update gets worse and the developers focus all their efforts on making it more and more difficult to advance without paying thousands of dollars in IAP. Definitely not for the casual player, don’t start playing if you don’t already have a top tiered tank."
"4441",606310581,"Are you lazy? Do you lack the motivation and discipline to go to the gym or stick to a diet? Can’t be bothered to seek self improvement? Then this app is for you.   This app will help you get more likes and attention than ever before. Want to promote the idea of self love and natural beauty while you airbrush and photoshop your own imperfections? This app can do that."
"4442",606310581,"It is 👌."
"4443",606310581,"It’s very fun I use it to make funny photos with my friends we laughed for hours after words absolutely recommend it!"
"4444",606413051,"When I’m traveling and my husband is driving. It helps me pass the time. It also exercises my brain. As I’ve had brain cancer."
"4445",606413051,"Fed up with all the ads"
"4446",606413051,"This is my favorite Solitaire App!!!"
"4447",606800657,"It’s littty"
"4448",606800657,"It’s great"
"4449",606800657,"This is a great game I just wish their was more classs and that they have combined class like revenger plus mage = blood mage    Or summoner and wr class = dragons knight or Valkyrie. And many other and I wish people spend more time on the game instead on line app if you’re a hardcore gamer you spend your time playing not on another app. If people want a great game download AVABEL and experience this great world and awesome graphics but don’t get the line app it have nothing to do with this game I don’t recommend line app for AVABEL. Hardcore gamer need to experience the game not just talks about it on a different app. The game have lot to offer don’t get hoodwinks into getting another app to talk."
"4450",607527020,"I found this game to get progressively harder in a way that just made you come back for more."
"4451",607527020,"I just complete the whole game and really hope they come out with new episodes!"
"4452",607527020,"This is a quite fun game, but the reason I'm giving it only four stars is because the free version only gives you thirty puzzles, which you can complete easily"
"4453",608188610,"좋다. 좋아~~"
"4454",608188610,"Great site"
"4455",608188610,"Definitely recommend"
"4456",608206510,"Way too many click throughs and it’s locking up more and more. Have to either wait until the next day or delete and reinstall. Gonna delete for good"
"4457",608206510,"Too many pop ups directing you to other things when all you want to do is get to playing.  It is rather annoying."
"4458",608206510,"It is a good game. Interesting"
"4459",608707318,"It is good game, but I have some suggestions.  First, please make the ball more 3dimensional.  Second, please add more themes and better music.  Thanks for making this wonderful game!"
"4460",608707318,"Waist of 3$ , terrible, all I gotta say."
"4461",608707318,"Temporary fun but not worth $2.99"
"4462",608847384,"Great game, fun can’t put down"
"4463",608847384,"It’s a very fun game"
"4464",608847384,"Very addicting and great game a plus..a"
"4465",608899141,"I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT GAME AFTER CUT THE ROPE MAGIC"
"4466",608899141,"This is so addicting!"
"4467",608899141,"I have a idea for a new game for you guys but first I want to say i love all of your games I only haven’t played pudding, cut the rope magic, and my on nom but here’s my idea so I think if you got all of your zeptolab games and put them in a raceing game like angry birds go I think it would be a fun game."
"4468",609405853,"Why so Expensive for a educational game"
"4469",609405853,"This game is really only meant for a 1-year-old or early 2-year-old. I have ""Restaurant 2"" which is a good game, and I got this game so my niece could pretend to run a grocery store. There are only 10 activities and they can only be done one specific way. None of the characters give feedback (in ""restaurant"" the characters shake heads yes or no if it is something they like... they give confetti if they love something, breathe fire if it is too hot...). In this game, you can never do anything wrong. The game just corrects you. It is simply a glorified shape sorting game (put bottle in right bin, find the matching fruit...), which kids move beyond by 2-3 years old. Not worth the money. If I could get a refund for games I would definitely return this one."
"4470",609405853,"Do not buy this game. If it was free it would be ok but seriously I can't believe you charge people for this pathetic game. You literally do everything in the whole game in 5 minutes and I'm not being sarcastic no joke. I will never download or purchase anything from this company again"
"4471",609577016,"Final Fantasy V is a great game, the graphics look clean and sharp. But I am disappointed with the music, it loops back to the beginning every time a random battle occurs. This did not happened in Final Fantasy Anthology for the PlayStation 1. The character sprites also could have been better."
"4472",609577016,"Great characters, story, and art. But please add support for iPhone XS Max, the game does not go full screen properly and it just looks lazy on this device."
"4473",609577016,"オメガ改倒したのにアチーブメントが登録されない 操作性も悪い 元は良い作品だから楽しめたけど"
"4474",609598558,"Yeah it’s a REALLY good app but... how is it different from the FREE version?? they are literally the EXACT same except one is 8 fricking dollars like really? really? i was expecting stuff like an alarm to where you have to walk around to make it turn off and more sounds that aren’t annoying.. also maybe the music is connected to spotify that way i can use my music to wake me up... but NO it’s the EXACT same so PLEASE tell me what’s different about the two apps"
"4475",609598558,"I am notoriously bad about not leaving reviews but I had to change that starting with this app. This app seriously saved me from being fired. I was a constant roll over and turn my alarm off without ever waking up person and my career was suffering for it! My work has very strict start times and I was showing up late and rushed all the time because I could never wake up. With this app I am able to set it so that I have two snoozes, and I love that you can limit them by how many you’re allowed and how long they are. And once they are finished I get up and go to the bathroom. I use the barcode challenge and I either scan my shampoo bottle or my tooth paste. And I might be a zombie for 20 minutes waking up but I’m an on time zombie and that’s what matters! I also love the random alarm sound feature as this keeps me on my toes because I really think I desensitize to the same sound everyday. If you are considering this app seriously give it a try! It’s the best alarm app ever and it will help you get up and get going on time everyday!"
"4476",609598558,"Absolute waste of $8. The app is identical to the free version, minus the little ads.   Would like a return so I can just use the free version. Absolute rip off."
"4477",609704981,"Won’t let me add friends from Facebook, when I try it it just shows me a blank screen."
"4478",609704981,"This app works perfectly fine other than the broken friends list. Every time I click on the + in the corner to invite someone, no one shows up on the list. Please fix this"
"4479",609704981,"I went thought a lot of effort to add my friend on Game Center, which isn’t easy now that it’s practically nonexistent. And I still can’t see their server. On top of that. I can’t even add them as a Facebook friends because that comes up as a blank white screen... this is extremely frustrating considering I spent actual money on something that doesn’t even work"
"4480",610391947,"Such an amazing game honestly a mobile game with those graphics , 2030"
"4481",610391947,"I love this game but how do you connect the DualShock 4 controller?"
"4482",610391947,"I really enjoy the game and play it often.   My major critique of this game is a logarithm they use to avoid compensating a gamer. They give away tons of items gamers dont use with the free boxes.   Also, could you find a way to stop all the hacking. It gets annoying when players jump so often in front of you playing multiplayer."
"4483",611071723,"The game is good but in the swimming and jumping worlds the training is horrible and not that fun but it good I guess"
"4484",611071723,"Pretty fun typical training game. Mini games can get tedious but payoff is satisfying. But game is too short, beat it and maxed out stats in one day. There’s no motivation to play any further, feels like a waste of money."

"4486",611436052,"I love playing this game on Xbox and other platforms. Unfortunately, I have encountered a bug on two different devices which means I get stuck and can’t move on in the game. The issue I am having is that once I get the swoop-bike accelerator I cannot go back and talk to gadon the gang leader. I click on his character and cannot initiate dialog. Very frustrating."
"4487",611436052,"One of my favorite games of all time. Possibly one of the greatest RPG’s of all time. Time has not been kind to it in terms of graphics cause they are pretty outdated. Beyond that, this game is one of the greatest. BioWare’s crowning achievement. I own this game on the original Xbox, an android tablet and now my IPhone. When I get my computer up and running, it’ll be on there as a staple piece as well.   It’s worth 20 dollars. So 10 is a no brainer if you’re considering the purchase. Also, with Lucasfilm rumored to delve into the KOTOR universe, it would be very wise of you to familiarize yourself with it before they get ahold of it."
"4488",611436052,"I want a refund my game keeps freezing on me and it makes me sad"
"4489",613398383,"I love the educational material in this app. Has something for every stage, age and varying interests! My toddler loves the bedtime songs because he even puts himself to sleep listening to those songs! The only thing I’d change if I had to complain of one thing is that I’ve deleted some of the downloads that shows material I don’t want my son to watch like the spooky stories and other holiday ones and he keeps downloading them. I just wish there was a way to completely block or delete the ones you don’t want your child re-loading off the library! The good thing is they do have a setting to download instead of streaming and I just have to remember to disable the WiFi so he won’t download new videos! It is worth the monthly due especially for traveling families who don’t want their kids addicted to YouTube before the age of 5! ;-)"
"4490",613398383,"I trusted this app and have been a subscriber.  There is a lot of great content on here that my kids have already watched on other apps (storybots, etc). But today my 4 year old started signing a song “you don’t have a wee wee”while pointing at her fathers crotch area.   Sure enough- she showed me a video from “Monica and friends” where an annoying brat of a boy pulls off the pants off an angel, points at his crotch and sings “you don’t have a wee wee”.  I’ve yet to browse through other videos... but I really didn’t like any of the dialouge in the 5 mins of Monica and Friends I watched.  Whiny, bratty characters. Pretty inappropriate. It makes me wonder what other content are in some of the video channels."

"4494",613980069,"This is now the 2nd app I'm trying (free ones) to swap faces and I'm wondering is the apple crew is doing their job cause this one is useless too : can't choose 2 faces at one time so the app just doesn't work!!"

"4500",615256100,"I have the shivers!!!!!!!!! The app is free to find ghosts. You can pay to talk to the ghosts but you don’t need to. I would say it is fake but my dogs are barking at the ghosts!!! 😱 I recommend this tracker because it’s so fun but it might be real."
"4501",615563599,"Great Tool!"
"4502",615563599,"I love Videoshop I think I’ve had it for about two years now! I would rate this app five stars, but there is one thing I would like to discuss. Sometimes I have trouble loading my videos in. Like I understand some might take awhile but sometimes it doesn’t load at all!"

"4510",617098629,"The app itself is good, but all of the projects that the the developers and the curators put on the featured channel don’t deserve to be there, and it is frustrating when you work really hard on a game and then they feature a gumball machine!"

"4512",617098629,"Hi I love your game but there’s this weird bug where when I’m playing my own game it freezes my own creation freezes when I tap on something it doesn’t do anything for example I made a game called help the girl get to her home or house I don’t remember so basically her family members were waiting for her and she just got back from school so you have to help the girl  get home but when I tap on anything it doesn’t work it’s like the game froze but when I exit the game everything is working again please fix this bug and maybe one day I will give it a five stars and recommend it to my baby (baby born tomorrow) this baby will be born tomorrow and my sis will send me to a random hospital and I want you to fix this bug right away so in the future she/he can grow up being really really creative"

But then number of gems you need to expand is CRAZY HIGH!!!  They want money - hardly ever able to earn free gems!  If your not planning on spending money in your game this is not the game for you! And if you do spend money and buy “gems” You had better spend them with he same session or you LOOSE THEM!!!"

"4520",619517698,"I first bought this game 5 or 6 years ago when it came out. It was incredibly fun, smooth and responsive. Fast forward all these years I finally got an iphone again so I got it from the cloud. This once fantastic game is filled with game ending glitches and I mean CONSTANTLY. I fail to see how the game runs so much worse on better hardware??"
"4521",619517698,"This game is so great but one problem, when you first download the game it takes about 20 minutes to load but other than that BEST GAME EVER LOVE IT SO MUCH 👉👍👍👍👍👍 🤝 Great work keep it up"
"4522",620112416,"Me encanta este juego, diario estoy jugándolo, pero a raíz de la actualización, todo mal,  me marca como error, no puedo entrar, y cuando logro hacerlo, súper lento, creo que deberían de dar una explicación, ya son varias personas que tiene ese problema!!! Yo hice una compra y me cobraron otra más, mande mi queja a soporte y no he obtenido respuesta..... Realmente me encanta este juego, seria una lástima tener que dejarlo.... Respuestas por favor..."
"4523",620112416,"*I really dislike the latest update. It’s frustrating that when you are styling and want to go back and look at the picture it instantly scrolls straight to the top.   I've been playing this game since it very first came out in 2013. I am loving the hair options and especially the makeup!! I really like seeing the changes to the makeup making it look more realistic.   What I don't like is that entering challenges takes a lot more money to style a look than it used to. I have to skip challenges because it's so costly. Luckily, I've built up my closet so I have a lot to choose from, but newer players I'm sure have to skip a lot of challenges and that is probably frustrating."

I do not know why it says I’m no online or how to get back on, if I am offline for the game. I have looked for a way to reach out to Support but have found no means of doing so. This is incredibly irritating, as I really do enjoy this game. If only I could get into it to play, I would gladly give 5 stars! However, if I remain unable to play I will be removing this app from my phone. 😢"

"4555",623789705,"Honestly, this game is really bad. For all you parents out there if your child really wants to play this game make sure to supervise them because there are people who swear, online date, and those things are just not good. To the developers, you should make this game much safer. I mean, cmon! You really did poorly when you were making this game. SO I SUGGEST TO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.           P.S. If you want to make this game better, start with the Chat. Make some limits!"
"4556",623789705,"I was having a lot of fun on this FREE Minecraft type game. Until I had monsters in my house (they come after you relentlessly) I died. No big deal since I didn’t have anything good with me. I waited about 20 minutes and never respawned. I restarted the app and my world never loaded up. I had good things and I was in a good area. Please take this bug out of the game."
"4557",623789705,"This app is amazing I love it but there are some things I would like to be fixed/added I would like buttons red stone and I would like it if doors to be where you can place them like in front of blocks like directly in front"

In my opinion SABO POWERS NEED TO BE REMOVED EVERYONE HATES THEM ITS NOT FUN TO PLAY AGAINST PEOPLE WITH PWR LOCK, TTS, AND KNOCK OUT PLUS SUPER BLOON BOOSTS THUS GAME IS GARBAGE WITH THEM."
"4562",624533261,"Whenever I do attack mode in quick play the music sometimes stops. Would you mind just fixing the problem? I gave 5 stars because it’s still a fun game but the music being gone bugs me a lot. Thanks and have a great day."

"4564",625257520,"Blizzard can’t get it correct. They keep pushing bad updates and game play. They have ruined this game just as they ruined WoW and Diablo. It maybe time for a leadership change at the development level. Check out their own employee reviews. If you don’t have happy employees you won’t put out a good product. This company is trending down fast. Game is still predetermined, rigged, and garbage. Haven’t played in about a month and the game is still junk. Still really bad. Blizzard flags accounts. If you spend a bunch of money they will “let” you win. If you don’t then they will flag you to lose. They want you to spend tons of money because they know the products they put out are crap. Even tavern brawl is rigged. Still junk. Negative stars should be an option. This game is a steamy pile of poo. This company supports terrorists and drug cartels."
"4565",625257520,"It’s easy to stay interested with the new card releases and solo adventures. More strategy than a heavy game of chess. I like the graphics."

"4570",625411864,"This is not fun. I do not like that your skill levels restart. The archer needs different skills. All In all bad game.  AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! Oh and the add is better then the game."
"4571",625411864,"The first 60% of this game is a beautifully stylistic roguelite RPG with an interesting set of classes and abilities, a strange but intriguing storyline, and a punishing but fair level of difficulty which requires you to make your moves very precisely. I loved it.  Then the bizarro portals came.  The last 40% of the game is an RNGfest where strategic planning goes out the window and you just have to pray to RNGesus that multiple portals don’t end up getting placed close together and drown you in an endless flood of bizarro enemies. You’re forced to restart levels over and over again until the procedural-generation finally doesn’t screw you, and then for a brief, wonderful moment you’re back to playing the game you loved. Then you move to the next floor and it’s another coin flip.  I’d love to know how this quirky story ends, but it’s not worth wading through the RNG chaos of the last couple levels. The really baffling thing is that the first half of the game has spider nests, but the devs (intelligently) put restrictions on them to prevent them from completely flooding a floor with spiders. Then they threw out all those restrictions for the bizarro portals."
"4572",625411864,"Despite being adapted from a pc version, Sproggiwood feels absolutely perfect on mobile. Never crashes, doesn't drain battery or run my phone hot, and is both charming and challenging.   I've been playing for a week now and all I can say is that it's the best roguelike I've played. I love it"

"4579",625994547,"They asking money to send sms for vote - this is disgusting!"
"4580",625994547,"But, you can clearly see that it was poorly QAed."
"4581",625994547,"I’m in the United States why isn’t it available??  The app won’t allow me to view the live stream"
"4582",626362411,"I’ve gone back to this diet multiple times but this is the first time I’ve used the app. I’ve completed 3 weeks of the diet using the app as a guide on my water intake, weight loss and an easy guide on what to eat on which days.  I’d say for the price, the app is ok. I would like a way to be able to add my own recipes as I don’t always make the Fast Metabolism Diet Recipes that are options in the app. And I also agree with others that for fruit, I would like to be able to pick more than one type of fruit. I also would like to be able to add more weeks as I plan on using the app after the initial 4 weeks is up."
"4583",626362411,"Ok maybe it’s 4.5 star but I was really impressed by how helpful the app was in planning the diet. Meal planning is a breeze, you just choose what to eat from a calendar and lists limited by food type and phase. I love the shopping list generation as well. I am a really bad planner and this diet was intimidating for my daily routine; the app made it possible, almost fun. The my day tab is also incredibly well designed.  Now for the cons: - I’m vegetarian+fish and I had to eliminate all meat items one by one; considering the number of vegetarian users, I recommend a preference to eliminate all meat (and all fish for the strictly vegetarian) during initial setup; - accessing the meal map tab, it should bring you by default to today’s date, I grew tired of browsing through the week every time (the my day tab doesn’t cover all functionalities one has in the meal map) - it would be nice if the app interfaced to Apple Health at least to automatically read my weight data  By the way the diet works like magic, couldn’t shed as much weight if I skipped all meals."
"4584",626362411,"This app is good for someone on the diet.  However, I think it should customize the serving sizes depending on what a person weighs.  A 200lb person needs a different amount of calories than a 130 lb person.  It should recalculate serving sizes"
"4585",626469977,"Support has to do something about multiplayer cheaters who start a game and then don’t play.  When the game is finished they wait for me to quit.  The game hangs and if I want to keep playing I have to quit.  And because I quit they win the game and get the pack of cards.  That’s real fair.  It’s happened to me multiple times the last few days.  So frustrating!  Not going to play multiplayer anymore.  And eventually won’t even play the app unless something is done to correct this."
"4586",626469977,"The game itself is very fun. The players and equipment are all cool, and the events held daily are fresh. Although, the game has many bugs that need to be fixed. There have been multiple times I have won a derby, and had to forfeit the match because the game would freeze; furthermore, it only seems to freeze when I am about to win a match. Another bug is the home runs not counting. I have had incidents where a ball goes a certain distance they will not count, and I do not mean the ball hitting the top of the dome in a indoor stadium. For example, I kept hitting the Cleveland’s Indians sign and they would not count. Overall the game is great and quality is good, but there are a few bugs that are extremely aggravating."
"4587",626469977,"When I touch to hit the ball the bat keeps on moving."
"4588",626583252,"There are still bugs...so I want to be concise about the one that is the most bothersome. When you apply a leak overlay, you CANNOT modify both the opacity and color, each time you switch to the other adjustment tab, it resets the other. For example, if I apply a leak, the opacity is automatically at 80, so adjust it to 50, and go to the color adjustment, immediately the opacity is reset to 80. Conversely, if I adjust the color first, going to adjust the opacity resets the color to the default position. You cannot even apply the filter with one correct setting, and pull down the filter history panel to go back and edit the leak for the other setting, color/opacity, because this causes even more bugs to spark, like the image saving without the filter applied at all, even though you can see it applied in the interface editing display. Between this and the other bugs, as well as the fact that my past purchases $$ were rendered a waste with the UI overhaul I have not been very happy about this app :("
"4589",626583252,"I will use this app time to time. Yet this time I went to use it and My IPhone 8 doesn’t have access to overlay a picture. Used to work ok and now useless to me."
"4590",626583252,"Great filters but after I saved my sharp photo in this app the saved image was very hazy and blurry. Compressing original images that much takes away from the quality. Deleted app."
"4591",627879091,"I’ve owned and played all the games in the Sorcery series and loved them but I am disappointed that none of them have been optimized for the iPhone X screen."
"4592",627879091,"This game is amazing I bought the bundle with all four games and I’m into the 2nd game so many options to get through different scenarios you can get different results every time it’s amazing"
"4593",627879091,"This is the kind of innovation that Inkle is great at.  This take on a fantasy RPG plays almost like the pen and paper games of old, but with fresh graphics and a very fun and open spell interface.  Please keep them coming!"
"4594",627880433,"Based on the great reviews I read, I was really excited to play this game.  However, after about 5 hours of playing, I’m perplexed why people rate this game so highly. There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the consequences of your actions (sometimes you make a seemingly logical choice and you die; others times you pick something whimsical and get rewarded with treasure).  The spell book mechanics are awkward, forcing you to flip back and forth between menus to try to figure out which spell might help in a given situation.  And the storyline is a bit too linear for my taste, not allowing you to go back and explore areas you have previously been too.  Thank god I bought this game a couple years after it’s release, so I only wasted $5 on it.  Avoid at all costs."
"4595",627880433,"In the first installment, I felt as though I was really choosing my own adventure — there were so many things I knew I was missing as I blundered my way through which really made the game feel magical and unique, and made me want to replay it to see what I’d missed. In this one, you have to wander aimlessly through a city, covering every inching and getting thrown backwards or killed at any “wrong” step. You’re forced to collect 4 spell lines, ensuring that you experience the exact same things every time. I felt as though I was being railroaded by a storyteller who insisted on me playing through one particular story. What’s the point of a “choose your adventure” that forces you to choose the one right path?"
"4596",627880433,"I went over the four apps in my review of the first book, I’ll just add a few things. Again Inkle has enhanced an old, classic gamebook and created a fantastic game. This second volume is far superior to the first one—it takes a long time to understand what’s going on, to gather all the clues that you need to succeed, although it is also the continuation of the previous volume. It can seem sometimes it will be difficult to finish it but it is never impossible, and the rich universe that lies behind the story is full of mysteries and twists and keeps you involved. A must-have."

"4600",627994145,"I really don’t like hot sauce"
"4601",627994145,"This game is really fun but there are lots of annoying ads. Also sometimes it crashes when I’m so close to beating a level! 😫 And once I lost and I kept trying to retry but the game just kept saying game over! I’m lucky that it fixed when I reopened the app!! Overall, there are a few bugs that need fixing and ads that ruin the experience of the game."
"4602",627994145,"Look it is a REALLY good game. It’s great for killing time and it is really fun. The only reason I can’t give this 5 stars is because it is WAY too easy. I mean get this into respective. I got this game on Easter. I finished it an hour later. Plus the last level is too easy. It would be better with more level that are actually challenging."

It is so much fun"
"4608",629059031,"For some reason the buttons don’t want to register my fingers... having no other problems with any other apps, either the buttons are too small or something because it is happening very often.

"4618",632079234,"This game is amazing, because I love space and spa ships and things. But I would love for you to have an update that is a lot like Star Command Galaxies because that game seems to be a lot more detailed and interesting than this one. Still five star though for how amazing the game is, not in comparison to Star Command Galaxies. If it were in comparison, I’d probably give it a 3 star. So if you can make more planets in the galaxies, teleport to a planet and an enemy ship and Trade Stations. It would be amazing to have this game molded into something like Star Command Galaxies, but this game is amazing I would of course recommend it because it’s fun, (short), and action packed. I recommend starting on normal then when you beat it go on to hard, because hard is probably the most realistic since your shield breaks easier and enemies can invade. I love this game, so please listen to my review. Thank you for an amazing time and an amazing journey through the universe."
"4619",632079234,"This is a glitchy slow terrible app   How it got good reviews is a insane  Honestly I want my money back"
"4620",632079234,"Good game but there’s a bug or glitch where I crash after the Neptune mission. Can’t get past it. Very frustrating but otherwise solid game to buy. EDIT: What was mentioned above was simply my stupidity on not knowing what to click. Great game with a good story. Nice mechanics. I would like the ability to board enemy ships or land on planets maybe but other than that it’s worth the 2.99! Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes RPG, RTS, and sci-fi games."
"4621",632231181,"This is a great app. It made it very easy to follow my participants thru-out the race. I wish this app was available for all races."

"4626",632285588,"I used to play this game years ago when it first came out and when you had to complete each level. the game has changed the game a lot. You have to buy themes and it’s not the same fun that it used to be. There’s not many good features anymore either."
"4627",632297587,"Love this game but I’m very disappointed it’s unable to run on the new IOS"

"4638",632344648,"Had an original Boom and wanted to update. I read the incredible collateral telling me the new Party Up would allow to pair multiple speakers so why buy anything other than the UE. Bought two Megabooms, a 3 and a discounted original... Dude, i have to have them sitting next to each other to avoid and drop outs from the auxiliary ‘Partied Up’ speakers... I live in a small apartment and wanted music on the balcony to match the music inside... nope, unless you don’t mind a skip every two to three seconds. Help would appreciated."
"4639",632827808,"This is a great game, except footprints the bugs!  First, you claim we get power ups faster in challenges. You don’t , I checked it out. Second, in challenges, when you are trying to get power ups for the challenge, many times the game doesn’t give you the prizes. I just tried a challenge where I needed to get 15 power ups. I had 11 with 25 seconds to go, and 4 powerups on the board. I got all 4 BEFORE time ran out, but was never given credit for them, so I lost the challenge I should have won 10,000 coins, but got nothing. There are some other glitches, but minor ones that you can live with.  Don’t get me wrong, I still love this game, it’s the best, I just wish you could get rid of some of the bugs!"
"4640",632827808,"Bring back the 2016 soundtrack of Tetris Blitz"
"4641",632827808,"Every time I use power ups or finishers, the game begins to load, but freezes about halfway through and I have to close the app to correct it. This results in me losing any coins and power ups/finishers I was attempting to use. Very discouraging."
"4642",633625517,"I never had a PC because it’s expensive to get a decent set and it’ll be awhile before I could afford one. I love RPGs because they offer a world to explore and interact with. I heard of all these classic games of the Baldur’s Gate series and Planescape Torment. Once I heard they’re available on IOS, I immediately bought them and I’m glad I had the chance to finally play them. I was glued to the phone for hours and hours of playing the Baldur’s Gate saga. From BG1 to BGSOD (which I found more entertaining than BG1) and finally to BG2. I haven’t played a game this good since Fallout New Vegas. I just have one problem with this game. A year ago I had lost two saves when I was near to the end of BG2 and I knew I’ll never get those hours back. I put off from playing awhile and waited for a year. I started to replay the saga and it’s great to experience it all over again. The problem you see is that I finally got to Spellhold and I got the hand of Dace. I went over to the kobolds surrounding the crystal and killed them all with a Skull Trap. By the time I got to the crystal, two goblins appeared but nothing happened. From what I remembered, there were supposed to be more spawn of enemies and I believe one of them carried the crystal I needed to progress through the story. And now I’m stuck at Spellhold. I’m grateful you guys were able to port the classic games to IOS and I appreciate everything you have done. What can I do to fix this bug Beamdog? I lost my saves from a year ago and ai REALLY don’t want the same thing to happen again. Seriously, I cannot thank you guys enough."
"4643",633625517,"Played it back in the day. Was excited about this version. Bugs very soon into the game, will put it aside until they are fixed."
"4644",633625517,"Superb game, my only complaint is lack of iPhone X support. The sooner you add it, the closer you are to perfection."
"4645",634013256,"Please update this game because it’s fun to play, this game reminds me of Chris Sawyer’s Locomotion but better. But I’m tired of working hard to get to lvl 70.0 and the game crashes and I had auto-save on but when I opened the game after the crash I was back at lvl 34.0 even though the game saved before it crashed also I had $15M before the crash and when I went back into the game I was at $0 and all of my vehicles were making $0/h then the game crashed once again. So can you please update this fun game. Thank you."

"4648",634158738,"I managed a Christian Bookstore for 10 years and have seen a lot of study aids.  This is the best and it offers a lot of free study helps.  The developers obviously want to support the growth of believers."
"4649",634158738,"I purchased this app because the description stated there are “over 100” other versions and resources available for free download. I use the NIV, NLT, and the NASB for my Bible study. All of those more modern versions are paid downloads. So disappointed. Maybe a list of free Bible version downloads should be included in the description."

"4654",634329875,"i’ve spent a little more than i’m willing to admit. the claws are incredibly weak it’ll nearly lift objects and loosen up. for how much it costs you would think the claws would be at least decent. really wish i could go back in time and get my money back. prizes are cute though if you’re lucky enough to get it or spend 100$ dollars to fiddle with a weak claw to inch around prizes till they drop. good ides weak execution."
"4655",634329875,"I have a bad habit of spending money on a whim; there are strategies to play the game and win (I won once) but unless you do not have strong discipline of when to spend and when to wait, I recommend against the app. I thought I could handle it but I’ve gotten pretty sullen after dropping $15 already. I forced myself to spend the rest of my toreba points so I’m not tempted to buy just a little more for en extra turn; I only plan to use free plays at this point."
"4656",634329875,"I wish they would at least reply back to you not with an automated reply! I still didn’t get my items from a month and a half ago! Usually I don’t have any problems with them shipping out my items but it’s been a month and a half. Also why did you take away the PayPal option to purchase TP? Now you can only purchase TP through your iTunes Acct, which is a bad idea because what if you don’t have that much left In There but you want to play more! I guess I’m not playing anymore or at least not paying to play anymore cuz I don’t really like to use my iTunes account to purchase stuff. Should have left it the way it was or give people the option of PayPal and iTunes together."
"4657",634467171,"Those of us who paid $3 via IAP to unlock all features (when that was the highest-priced IAP at the time) should NOT have to pay again. If I had known the original purchase would be rendered worthless with a subscription plan I (and I'm sure almost everyone else) wouldn't have bought it to begin with. Why and how Apple allows this fraud in the App Store is beyond me, yet it has unfortunately become an ever-growing trend among greedy dev(il)s. At least give us old-time (pre-subscription) customers our money back since the features we paid for have ALL been unethically replaced with a subscription paywall and we now have no more access to the app's features than do those who haven't invested a penny (which is less than this fremium crapp is currently worth). This is unacceptable business."
"4658",634467171,"Dope"
"4659",634467171,"I kinda hate that I was one of the first to download and pay for the app to do video and picture edits but now I have to pay more for a feature that didn’t exist when I downloaded the app? Eee yeah no."

"4663",634885478,"This was clearly a labor of love. These developers clearly put a vast amount of time, professionalism and work into this game. The puzzles require some out-of-the-box thinking. But they still make sense as you play along. Gorgeous world-building, character development and voice acting. Perfect game for those of us who appreciate thinking and creative challenges in their point-and-click adventure games.  Note to devs: The inventory set-up on this game was much better than the sequel. The sequel hid the inventory under an extra button push that got tedious trying out different items. Obviously not a big complaint but if the devs make another sequel, perhaps they might consider using this style inventory instead."
"4664",634885478,"The music and the animation were absolutely wonderful. The storyline for the game what’s very interesting with all its many twists and turns."
"4665",634885478,"Although the concept and story of the game is unique and interesting, there were many issues involving tapping an object and choosing objects close together. The bugs in the game made it continually difficult to focus on the art and story. Additionally, many of the puzzles did not make sense. As an avid puzzle game player, it made me disappointed that I had to rely on hints because many of the puzzles were unclear and unconnected. This game had potential to be great, but lacked in the programming and the connection in puzzles."

The new owners, apparently they make enough from their favorites, that they don’t bother with others. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! That’s all this is... an app. But, this one will take your money, glitch your game & lie and steal to not give it back. In case you’re on the fence, just look at the daily winners! Always the same players.... that will never change! And everyone else will always lose. After 6 years on this game (and only a month after discovering new owners) I am finally done.

"4671",635080617,"The last review was so right. The same players win all the time. They dominate the tournaments by cheating. Using multiple people to play their slot 24/7. Regular players have no chance to win weekly tourneys. Lately people have shown up On this game to do nothing but scam players. Ask for Apple cards or just plain ask for money. Pathetic. The squatters are the worst. The sit on games and don’t spin and wait for spinning players to gain the community bonus. But the people that spin get penalized for building up the bonus and getting the lower bonus amounts. It should be weighted by who is actually spinning.

It looks like they’ve increased the interactions with Santa too. I think the best thing about it though is the naughty or nice scanner. It doesn’t matter what time of year it is, if my kids start to act up I just tell them I’m going to scan them to see what list they’re on and boom they’re the most behaved 4 and 5 year olds. Also the Santa tracker and the video call from the sleigh on Christmas Eve are pretty cool for the kids. It’s just a great app and worth every penny!!!"

I will say the calorie counter is misleading. Stand still and just watch that thing fly. Smh it’s a shame. If you count calories for weight loss do not rely on what the app says you burn. I use it and let my Fitbit tell me what I have actually burned after a workout. Outside of that no complaints. Good for what it is. 2.5 months in and I’m 25 pounds down!"

I have been plying this game for at least a year and there is NO Prison, no Prison Escape scenario and no scenario where you pick your choice of items to carryon a situation!

As annoying as it was by the end of the week, it help make many funny memories. Overall this is a GREAT GAME"
"4712",639930688,"Ok let me start with this I got this for when I was bored or stressed ok first off toooooooooooooooooooooooooo many ads like way too many.Tone down on the a seriously I’m done with this game don’t get it it’s a waste of time,money,and space"
"4713",639930688,"Dumb ways to die is a very fun game. I was in my childhood and always will be. Even though it's a VERY messed up game its still fun,and it can teach you and your kids to not do dumb stuff like in the game. That's my opinion have a great day!🤗❤️"
"4714",640111933,"This game is so good"
"4715",640111933,"Pixel Gun 3D is one of my favorite games, I’ve played it since I was 6 or 7, it’s so fun to play that once you play you will never stop playing it. However there is one problem...TRYHARDS. I’m decent at the game but in my opinion.... TRYHARDS ABD ThREE CAT SPAM MUsT BE BANNED! EVERYONE HATES EM, THEY REMOVE EM Please Pixel Gun i am begging you please stop this, the problem is just getting worst 😫🥺 BAN! BAN! BAN!"
"4716",640111933,"This game has been on for a very long time and It’s not surprising! The games good, there are no spammers or hackers and it is great! The only thing is that every time I go out of private sandbox It says key_1013. Can you tell me what that means :)? Please fix this problem. Great game though:D!"
"4717",640199958,"On iPad if i start a download I can’t stop or pause it. I can’t watch downloaded videos without wifi.   Can you please fix this app, specially the issue where videos are not available without wifi"
"4718",640199958,"I would like to be able to watch session videos at greater than 1x speed. Unfortunately the WWDC app doesn’t support that."
"4719",640199958,"I have videos downloaded, but they won’t play unless I’m connected. Scrubbing yields a loading spinner, so it appears it’s not using the downloaded video at all."
"4720",640360962,"Love it"
"4721",640360962,"It really makes you realize how much of a cool community you really live in."
"4722",640360962,"I highly recommend Miguel Nunez from M. Nunez Painting.  Committed to a start date and started and finished on time. Best of all “Beautiful” work.  Thank you Miguel."
"4723",640364616,"I am a mom and I have played this game for years with both my kids. By far my favorite game!! Although I could not wait for the update, the controls are just too complicated. I appreciate the left stick options you added and auto swing, but here are my 2 current problems. In options I selected auto-pause, but it does not pause the game when I am crafting or in a chest. Also, I am playing on a phone screen and it is too small to have so many buttons covering the screen so in this case simpler is better. Keep up the great work! I know you will get all this sorted out! I’m a huge fan for life!!! 💜🤰🏻💜"
"4724",640364616,"I’ve been play terraria for as long as I can remember (I’m 15) and I’m excited to have many stuff from PC added but the controls make it impossible to play... you can’t fly and attack at the same time. I hope you guys fix this soon!  Edit: Thanks for the new control option! I can now enjoy the game! THANK YOU!!!!!!  Edit 9/16/19: I’ve built the same house 3 times because it won’t save my progress :/   Edit 9/20/19: I usually get the materials used to build my house back because it doesn’t get saved but this time I lost everything."
"4725",640364616,"As simple as that. Five stars is amateur-ish"
"4726",640484311,"My 7 year old son and I love to play this game!"
"4727",640484311,"This is an awesome game, I love it! I only have one question, does the game end where the two are rocking on the watermelon???"
"4728",640484311,"I’m only sad it’s over. I would definitely buy the next one if they ever did that"
"4729",640564761,"GREEN SCREEN😁"
"4730",640564761,"It’s so good I love it."
"4731",640564761,"I have had this for a few weeks and it was pretty good until a few days ago, all the noise just stopped. No matter what i do theres no sound."
"4732",640702076,"I really enjoy this app, and so does my little brother."
"4733",640702076,"Everything cost 🤑💶💵which makes people lose their Internet money 💸 everything should not cost money"
"4734",640702076,"So cute! A little pink bird that flys around"
"4735",640999250,"Apple didn't check on this one - it comes up with a search for Stereograms, but it is not a stereogram app. Falsely advertised - it is just side-by side drawings - not 3D Stereograms. Some people will be tricked by the false 'rating' of 'adults only' - there is no nudity or anything sexual."
"4736",640999250,"Interesting little app. Have never used another app like it, so I don't know how it would compare to others. The 3d effects are pretty cool and the instructions are helpful."
"4737",640999250,"Nice 3d stereogram app with a quite reasonable price. For the friends who doesn't familiar with the 3d stereogram pics, I suggest you keep patience, don't give it up so early. Cause once you truly build the basic skill for watching these pictures, it's really huge fun to use."
"4738",641519483,"If you’re the puzzle type and like to figure things out, then you’ll love this game.  I have played it through twice.  Boo! Is the Halloween version, same concept but on pumpkins, also very fun."
"4739",641519483,"Actually enjoy replaying this. Except maybe for the grass and flowers... they are a bit difficult. Well, tricky anyway. Finally CONQUERED B30!"
"4740",641519483,"Please add more levels, I got this game yesterday and beat all the levels already. Plz add more"
"4741",641900855,"I use this app because it is easy to access and I’m still figuring out Fire alpaca. It’s a good app! I do have a problem with the fact there’s no line smoother, though. The lineart is usually wiggly no matter how much caution I have while drawing. A line smoother would definitely be handy! Second off, this app is hard to do detailed drawings on! The blending doesn’t look that good and only 2/4 blenders actually work. Also, there’s no blur tool, no select option, and the brushes aren’t overall amazing quality. The things I wanna see from this app are line smoothing, better blend controls, blur tools, and a make it easier for detailed drawings. Good app overall! I would also like to say that whenever o download a piece, it always comes out blurry and strange looking. Please fix this!"
"4742",641900855,"I don’t really like this app at all especially on an iPhone in iPad it’s ok but much prefer something like procreate although procreate cost money it’s was more worth the storage sketches takes up"
"4743",641900855,"I love using this to draw, but i don’t like that when I want to duplicate something I can’t flip it, I also can’t get it to upload to sketches community, I got it to upload a few times in the past but now it just says  “You can only upload one thing a day” and I haven’t uploaded anything. Otherwise it’s a pretty good app! It’s better than most of the other ones i tried."
"4744",642064350,"I love this app, I have had it for years. Just wish there was a night mode option!"
"4745",642064350,"32ENT"
"4746",642064350,"I hate that if you want to download it got a complicated download feature"
"4747",642831690,"I would give this app 5 stars if only it would tell WHERE the picture was taken?!  Please consider doing that?!"
"4748",642831690,"Could be fun but every third time I move a puzzle piece it takes me to an ad. After a few of these it closes me out and I have to start a new one. You can have it!"
"4749",642831690,"Love these puzzles!!!    Challenging and fun!!!"
"4750",643165438,"I love Stellarium on PC so loaded this.  The displayed sky is very busy and hard to see on phone near Milky Way. PC version is perfect but it’s too much on phone screen at once.  Can you reduce this dense clutter."
"4751",643165438,"I used to have this on my PC a few years back. I miss being able to look with the different views (Convex, Concave, flat etc.), seeing somewhat hd pictures of planets and galaxies, changing how big the moon looked. I’m sure there are other things but those are a few of things that were on the PC version that I wish were in this. Anyway, in terms of a regular app, it’s outstanding. You should definitely give this app a try. It does have a sort of vr-like feature that’s pretty cool.      Hope you guys update!"
"4752",643165438,"This app doesn’t support Siri Shortcuts."
"4753",643496868,"I personally like google apps. Hangouts brings communication to a whole new level. I absolutely love the stickers. Very creative! Keep up the good work!"
"4754",643496868,"Omg this is so good ! I love this app I can call my Android friends phone I am happy and I love this app"
"4755",643496868,"Love it"
"4756",643791032,"The game constantly throws me out of the questions and marking them as not answered losing me points."
"4757",643791032,"I played 5 games and already had repeated questions. WHY???? Why make a game with not that many questions? Deleting the app."
"4758",643791032,"There are are lot of ads but the questions are at a good level for the average person"
"4759",643857704,"My app won't even open after I reloaded it.....there must be a big.....I used to live this app.....please fix it?"
"4760",643857704,"Agree. Not excited about the new  version.  But I will continue to try to like this version.  Preferred the prior one."
"4761",643857704,"I’ve been using this app for a while now, but after the latest fix it crashed. I was on level 11, and now it won’t let me login. I’d like to continue where I was instead of starting over again. Kind of frustrating!"
"4762",644077827,"But it’s ok."
"4763",644077827,"I am Jon Lord in a Deep Purple tribute. This app is so cheap, I thought I’d give it a try. Although it sounds pretty good, it is not as accurate as the Logic X/Mainstage vintage organ plugin. The tones sound thin and harmonics are missing. The sample loop on long sustains and it isn’t a smooth transition. It’s fun to dink around with, but not good enough to cover the DP sounds. You need amp modeling, amongst other things, to get that BEAST sound out of a software plugin organ. I do have a real 1967 C3 to compare sound so I am well aware of what the real sound is. It is great for a 10 dollar app. I’d pay more if they could make it sound more authentic."
"4764",644077827,"Hello and to whom it may concern,  I have the 64g iPad Air 2, and I have the Galileo 1 app installed along with Beatmaker 2 and others. The problem I'm having is that when I play the Beatmaker 2 app the Drawbars in Galileo app move with the rhythm and beat of Beatmaker 2 app thus changing the sound of the organ with every rhythm or beat. Can you fix this issue in the Galileo 1 app please. Thank you for your time and help with this matter."
"4765",644106186,"I can see now why this is so highly reviewed. easy to use. gives you lots of good effects for free and others are cheap. but what really sells it for me is the fact i can play it with me screen off, or even out of the app itself. i give this 10 out of 5 stars.   genius!!!!!   PURE GENIUS!!!!!"
"4766",644106186,"I’m using your app for almost 2 years but recently app crack a lot and when I play a song, it keeps making strange noises. please solve this problem!"
"4767",644106186,"Solid app just wish you guys would allow music to play while recording social media stories."
"4768",644245630,"PLEASE ,I suggest that you give us answer choices so it will be easy for the child to answer if he can't vocalize and also for the educator ( teacher, parent , caregiver, who ever teaching the child ) if he doesn't know the exact answer . I recommend that in all your apps , sometimes there are choices in the answers and sometimes not."

"4770",644245630,"Great for practicing pronouns of varying types.  I like that I can choose my targets by pronoun type, and that there are two ways to practice.  Also, data on which pronouns were correct and incorrect IS available-- tap the arrow at the right, and it will switch to that information.  I like that the data includes which level was practiced too, so that if I switch between levels I can see that in my data."
"4771",645384141,"Cachly is my favorite geocaching app! It's easy to use and it has an Apple watch app that I like to use when navigating on longer trails. I just need to glance at my watch to see how far away I am without getting my phone out. Love it!"
"4772",645384141,"Have many friends who swear by this, and I can certainly see it’s greatness in potential, but since buying it yesterday it has done nothing but glitch and refuses to change settings (ie ‘hide/exclude finds’) and repeatedly hasn’t been loading caches onto the map on startup. Settings are very detailed, but not all together in one spot, so it’s been a bit frustrating to try to backtrack my steps checking to see if I somehow set something wrong. Sometimes it shows caches, sometimes it doesn’t, and glitched where it kept showing me my finds no matter what I chose.  A service rep was very prompt in trying to reach out and offer help, which I appreciate. Although I still couldn’t figure out what went wrong, I finally just reset everything and it seems to be showing the caches properly, but I’m leery of making any custom changes now in case it glitches something.   The map zooms in closer than on the official Geocaching app, and sometimes the navigation arrow is more accurate, so I’m just going to use it when I’m searching and want to double check."
"4773",645384141,"To tell you how much I believe in this app I paid for its sponsorship in the GPS Maze in Texas after its leadership turned down the exposure to 3000 cachers in the US."
"4774",645422116,"My daughter loves this book/game. She said it is the best and asked that I rate it 5 stars."
"4775",645422116,"My 5 year just came up to me with iPad asking me to write a review. That has never happened. Just purchased this for her and I have not had a chance to go through it myself. My daughter loves the other Slim Cricket apps. Keep them coming."

"4778",645682444,"All links say bad gateway. Seriously?? Stuck with useless service?"
"4779",645682444,"So I bought a new phone, set it up, and thought I was ready to use it. Well I didn’t have all my pictures or anything else, all because I had to reset it multiple times during a 24 hour time frame, trying to locate my stuff. After I downloaded my Verizon cloud, all of pictures were there."
"4780",645704840,"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
"4781",645704840,"I used to enjoy the game on my iPad Air2.  I have been playing for a while now and I also purchased add free version.  My iPad Air 2 recently gave up the ghost and I purchased a new iPad Pro. I downloaded the game but it will not open. I have deleted the app and reinstalled it 4 times with any difference. I have also contacted App support but they have yet to send any response."
"4782",645704840,"This game is fun but it could be funnier"
"4783",645705454,"Cannot give this game enough praise for being funny, and well executed. Love playing it with my friends."
"4784",645705454,"Good game. Only one suggestion. Could you please make it to where if you snooze or quit you lose like 100 to 200 coins? It’s becoming a serious problem where people will just quit mid round. Please make this happen"
"4785",645705454,"me and my friends play this game at sleepovers, and every time i nearly pee myself"
"4786",645746786,"Why all of a sudden do I need to have pro to use this app at all?! I used to be able use the free version just fine and now I can’t. If you want to charge people fine but don’t let me download for free and then decide you have to get pro to use it at all."
"4787",645746786,"5 Bucks a month for something available for free elsewhere: Canva, Typorama etc. This will soon be a dying business model guys, you're gonna need to pivot"
"4788",645746786,"I am a new business owner & this app is perfect for my daily quotes that I post on Instagram & Facebook. This app is easy to navigate & has modern styles I love love love. I just began the new trial & after using all of the fabulous fonts, I see that I would not mind paying monthly for it 🤷🏽‍♀️."
"4789",645797558,"Edit:  zero stars.  The last boss kills me on their first round every single time.  How unsatisfying to spend dozens of hours playing this game to have no chance of completing it.  I have spent hours and hours losing over and again to level up, and I have tried every combination of character build, and I have never, ever gotten past the boss’ first attack.  What a frustrating, terrible experience this game turned out to be...  I love playing this game!  It is not perfect (the dialogue/story is quite standard/basic), I am extremely pleased with this being a match 3 style puzzler without having to deal with the annoyances that come with “free” to play games.  The art style is very pleasing and I love the detailed characters and enemies.  The gameplay is great, with lots of variety in attacks, depending on how you equip your characters.  I strongly recommend this game"
"4790",645797558,"Don't listen to the negative reviews. I've spent countless hours on the game and it's nearly perfect (and I've played hundreds of these types of games for countless years). Fun story, good soundtrack, incredible art, top tier game quality, and super fun gameplay. They take match 3 and add lots of great rpg elements. If you have any interest in a GOOD match 3 game, you should buy this game immediately. 5/5 stars. I'd give it more if I could."
"4791",645797558,"I’ve gotten a good number of hours’ entertainment out of this. It’s no Puzzle Quest but it’s fun in its own right. My one comment would be the dialog GUI style and sound effects feel unpolished. It starts out easy enough but does ramp up a bit in difficulty but it’s a good challenge and you have to save up for upgraded emblems, spells and potions. You really do need to pay attention to each monsters abilities and ensure you have spells equipped to counter them. The RPG element is lost since your whole group autolevels but you can buy spells and upgrades from towns. No IAP in sight which is fantastic. I would recommend this game to anyone itching for a puzzle adventure game that doesn’t annoy."
"4792",645949180,"I enjoyed this game till recently. I’ve sent emails and contacted support with no response. When you need to get access with a key to another world you ask friends. But, it won’t let you anymore. It says you’ve already asked, when you haven’t. So it wants you to spend money to do it. Not cool! Hence the score. I already spend money in this game."
"4793",645949180,"This game crashes often. Have to reopen. That was bad enough now they’ve raised the price of additional coins or packages. I would have kept purchasing coins before but their greediness has caused me to look elsewhere making sure I avoid same developers!👎😡"
"4794",645949180,"Watching ads will no longer spin the wheel for more time or prizes.  Ever since the “Lords of Mobile” advertisement started playing a while back it stopped the wheel from working. You are forced to watch the ad but when it goes back to the wooden wheel after watching, it won’t spin it, it just says “well done, watch more videos tomorrow”, even if it is your first add or spin.  Once in a blue moon it will play a different ad and then work properly, but recently all I get it the Lords of Mobile ad over and over again.  What a rip-off, you are getting g paid for us watching the ads but we are getting nothing in return.  I’m on level 699 and I’ve about had it, this ones finally going to the trash can for good."

"4796",646100661,"I have aol for probably over 20 years. Having the app on my phone in the past has been great. Over the past several months the app keeps asking me to sign in on aol.com. Very annoying!!!! Why even have the app if I have to sign in every ... single....time for the most part."

Please, please fix the bugs...There is so much going on in this world,and for some fantasy is all they have...I just know my sons face lit up when I finally caved in and purchased this... I’ve searched all over the web for info on this game...I’m so frustrated..I payed for a game that can’t even be played....so far the only version that looks like it works the way it should is on xbox360 and we don’t have one...   Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this                                               -Just a mom that cares"

"4804",646504584,"I'd like to use this app in my classroom. It would be ideal if you could import PDF files into the blank canvas so I can demonstrate the constructions on  the same worksheets students are working on."
"4805",646504584,"This is a great little tool. But it would be enormously more satisfying if it had some sort of relative positioning recognition so that the point of the compass or edge of the ruler or point of the pencil could sit perfectly at the conjunction of two lines, or a line and an arc, or two arcs... This is the kind of thing that Photoshop does well, not leading the user, but just tugging at a likely intersection... Otherwise all the precision is kind of wonky ... the ruler or the compass pin or the pencil moves a little when I lift my finger..."

"4816",648019675,"When I play with my friends, it automatically forfeits the game in round 7. I thought it was because of the timer but we just finished playing.... until the forfeit and I had a little under four minutes on the clock! Please fix this."
"4817",648019675,"I have played this game a lot and I believe portrait orientation was nice and convenient. I really can not understand why developers have decided to completely remove it. Is it possible to make it optional? P.S. I have iPad Pro."

"4828",648998642,"I was looking for some interactive books for my twins to read. I was happy to have found this and it really is excellent but we won't be purchasing past this first one. It only took us 15 minutes to get through the entire thing including the interactive parts.  This is too short to cost $5.99. It's more like the first chapter in a chapter book for kids and is not a complete story.  It does not have an ending and you are expected to move onto the next book which also costs $5.99.  I recognize that they do have bundles so that you can get the set cheaper. However, I feel that the books individually should be priced more appropriately.  It's nearly $30 for the bundle of 7 ""books"" (more like chapters) and $42 if purchased separately.  If you have the money though, I do recommend them."
"4829",648998642,"I used to have this app when it was free and let me tell you it was soooooo fun, so one day I just started thinking about it so I found it and bought it, it's still pretty fun but yo"
"4830",648998642,"Great start to an incredible series. It looks like they just refreshed some of the artwork too. Glad to know they're still taking the time to improve the app! This is my niece's favorite story."
"4831",649181106,"Game crash every few minutes."
"4832",649181106,"Fun while it lasted, but my 2 year old had all the levels done in 20 minutes, so definitely not worth the money for such a short game. Just keeps repeating after you finish the 4 levels."
"4833",649181106,"My 4 year old, absolutely loves this game! Hours on top of hours of him playing with the different interactions of this game. Although, I did have to remind him that he can not paint the walls in our house unless he has permission first! I recommend this game to all parents!"
"4834",649246860,"Great app for radar."
"4835",649246860,"I enjoy this app for travel. I do wish it would show rain/weather systems over the ocean."
"4836",649246860,"Simple and effective weather presentation."
"4837",649822618,"I just started playing this game, and, honestly, it’s pretty good. The graphics are top-notch, and you can really let your creativity run wild.                However, there is one problem that I have experienced a few times: whenever I turn on the place/erase tool before I edit one of my works, the game instantly crashes. If this game was really cared for by it’s creator, and it doesn’t crash, this would hands-down be my all-time favorite game."
"4838",649822618,"I tried to erase a block and the part of your phone that makes noise stoped working the game froze and wouldn’t let me turn off my phone DO NOT DOWNLOAD AT ALL COST"
"4839",649822618,"Plz fix the game. You should allow players to have all the items when the player starts. Otherwise it's a BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! Stop the energy bar. But in a different view it's a great game."
"4840",649983655,"App was not updated to work with new iOS so it is dead."
"4841",649983655,"I have played this game a lot whenever I got bored or got nervous, and it was a great game for just simply occupying you. But now since the new iOS 11 update has rolled out it is now unplayable because of incompatibility. I hope it gets updated soon, hopefully with more levels."
"4842",649983655,"Challenging, good game!"
"4843",650276551,"Now I can always squeeze in a quick workout right away in the morning!"
"4844",650276551,"I went from not working out for 5 years to not missing a day in 90 days. Seven eliminates the most common excuses for not working out: finding time, traveling to a gym, investing in equipment, etc. I work out after I wake up before showering right in my living room. It also eliminates the uncertainty about what to do next, as it suggests workouts based on your goals (Fitness, Strength, or Weight). All you have to do is press “Start” and a workout will be loaded for you that takes into account what muscles you worked on the day before, as well as your goals/difficulty. I have tried everything: gym memberships, trainers, working out with a buddy, etc. Seven has been the only thing that has motivated me to be more active. More than worth it to pay the subscription since it is way less than most gym memberships."
"4845",650276551,"I wish it would give me more exercises without having the subscribe but otherwise the app is awesome"
"4846",650645305,"I think this is great for children like me! I also think that it is not complex and is very easy to color everything. If there's an awesome app this could be the one I could ever wish for! I really love it! Thank you for releasing a wonderful app like this!..."
"4847",650645305,"A just love this, it's really fun to play and it's very easy to color. I love it so much everybody should try it and see how awesome it is. If you like coloring then you should definitely try this app."
"4848",650645305,"I love it so much, Quiver is so good and relaxing you should totally install the game now. The app is very user-friendly and easy. The UI, the functionality, no hiccups, the API integration..."
"4849",650684932,"Helped me troubleshoot ABS issues on a Ford.  Developer question - Do you have a way to add multiple vehicles to the app so I can store data on more than one car?"
"4850",650684932,"Love this one"
"4851",650684932,"I paid for this after looking at a host of apps, looking for one thing. Read codes and reset the light if necessary. All of them display codes but resetting the engine light is elusive. Auto Doctor comes close but to add reset you have to subscribe. I am against recurring fees as much as possible. I finally found and paid the $10 for this app and am glad I did. Solid Support and no subscription fair pricing. Cheap insurance for an innocuous engine light when you want to be able to know if something real goes wrong. Plus there is a lot more."
"4852",650715760,"The app doesn’t use the full screen anymore on my X and looks like there’s no update"
"4853",650715760,"Love what this app can do... when I can get a new project to open. I’m tired of the “circle of death” 🤨"
"4854",650715760,"I love this app, but lately is too slow. I spend too much time trying to open something o adding letters. Also, often the app crashes while I am working on a project. It is so annoying! And the writing to the “support” people is just a waste of time. Then don’t even bother to send you an automatic response."
"4855",651209536,"Yes"
"4856",651209536,"This game was fun and I got some decent monsters, but I had my Facebook linked and one day I went to log in the game, everything was gone and Facebook was unlinked."
"4857",651209536,"Hands down awsome"
"4858",651277515,"This game is awesome but as I said but please make a conclusive episode in about a few months from now please"
"4859",651277515,"I’ve played a number of the Choice of Games series, but Sabre’s of Infinity is an excellent title that stands above the rest. The game is detailed, engaging, and genuinely interesting and fun to immerse yourself in. To this point, I’ve only played a single title that exceeded this in quality, through choice of games, with the title being Guns of infinity. An excellent title, worth the money."
"4860",651277515,"An amazing game, looking forward to playing Guns of Infinity. Trying to decide which game I enjoyed playing more, this or Mecha Ace is a great problem to have 😋."
"4861",651309421,"good application"
"4862",651309421,"This app is user friendly and really helpful for managing followers on Instagram!"
"4863",651309421,"This app is great. When it works. It crashes A LOT or goes black. Please fix it!"
"4864",651323845,"Helped me out twice buying train tickets in last minutes!   Very good overall experience!"
"4865",651323845,"智行棒棒滴，赞👍"
"4866",651323845,"仅仅给你一个赞美远远是不够的，给你10赞美：【十全十美】！👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"4867",651510680,"Playing the Triviathon option is a lot of fun and good practice for getting better at answering fast and knowing what they’re asking. However, every single time I’m on a streak and an advertisement pops up and exits out, triviathon exits me out and says “try again?” As if I just failed a question. Also the ads are insane and just plain awful. Better games are to be found on this App Store. Much much better games.  Edit: Now TriviaThon has upped their advertisements game and the ads will stay on the screen during a game with someone else, while the timer runs out, and the ad is unable to close because the screen is locked. Fun game, but absolute garbage setup."
"4868",651510680,"so many ads i lose turns and get hit with them even if i choose not to watch one anyways"
"4869",651510680,"So I love this game, play it everyday and bought the ad free (totally worth it) but whenever I play SURVIVAL MODE I get and error message right before it revels the right answer to a question. I'm losing out on so many points and wasting my free chances on the survival mode. Any way you can look into this problem? Other than that this game is hands down my all time favorite!"
"4870",651978174,"I have had this game since the day I got my tablet."
"4871",651978174,"Great game love it!!!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁"
"4872",651978174,"Ok I have construction simulator 2 and 3 and they are very good games and I have seen some other games and those two are the best so far. You are my favorite developer of construction games but this game is a no no! I hate that you have to tilt it to turn. I wish that there was some more of everything. I want it to be reallisic plz. Please write back. Thx."
"4873",652039347,"Could have more options for makeup and clothes."
"4874",652039347,"It is so pretty"
"4875",652039347,"I got this game thinking of you super fun but then after I got it I realize that this is not a really good game are used to have it done for some reason it went off my tablet so I got it back and everything was different I had to buy stuff with money that I don’t have to there’s some parts in the game that you can’t even do because the people decided people should start paying the money I love this game this game is like my third game time making new designs but it’s really annoying because now I have to buy a lot of stuff and I don’t wanna spend the money because I love this game but I need my money for other things and my parents wouldn’t approve so all I can say Libby is please please please bring it back to work it to where I don’t have to pay a lot of money just to play the game"
"4876",652077009,"You should add a new mode for friends to play. It should be local, or with friends from the Game Center. It would be a decent feature for Toca Builder. Otherwise, this game is great for kids!"
"4877",652077009,"This give me much more building skills and I love it because it’s fun also it’s for anyone to play!"
"4878",652077009,"Toca boca this is your boss I want u to make a toca builders 2 with all the same characters that are in the first one but your going to add more characters and put lots more stuff in it and make the world bigger. 😘"
"4879",652138155,"I wish they would bring more thing in the game it get boring after a while"
"4880",652138155,"This game is awesome but I wish that there was more fish, more tourneys, more gear, and more lakes and rivers."
"4881",652138155,"Good game except as of January unable to restore my purchases"
"4882",652945710,"I just started playing this game recently, after seeing my friend playing it. It’s so addicting and fun! I like how it lets you know that if you want to continue an ad will play.   There’s one thing I’d like to address, though. The game takes longer than it should to load. Other than that, it’s so fun! I recommend it.   -Søphie"
"4883",652945710,"To many adds and there long"
"4884",652945710,"🌹...as a result of not being able to complete a puzzle there should be a option to go forward& come back to a skipped puzzle...this is My 3rd attempt at downloading this game because not being able to play a subject without stalling ..unfair advantage"
"4885",653031147,"The first thing usually I worry about is having an alarm that tells me what to do because that would seem very annoying, however with this app I find myself enjoying every time the water reminder tells me “hey ! Its time to drink water”  - also - having the flexibility to choose the best time to remind me is key.  realized that my water intake throughout the day is under the optimum level that works for me - it has just been a week and I have found out lots of changes with my taste pallets whereby the more water I drink the better I feel + the less sugary and salty food I crave.  This app certainly is simple, efficient and does the job - I also love the animations they use and Apple Watch reminders, beautiful graphics. Being a bit greedy here -  maybe more of those graphics ? Cuz they’r amazing - I’d be really really be happier with it."
"4886",653031147,"I can think of many things that can be done to make this app more dynamic and adaptable instead of just a simple app that acts as a log and sends you preset reminders. The most obvious one is to change your required daily intake based on your level of activity. iPhones and Apple Watches log your basic level of activity (distance walked, flights climbed, number of steps) and many people log their physical activity into the health app using different apps and activity trackers. Wouldn’t it be cool if the app accounted for that and upped your required water intake based on your level of activity each day? Other things the app can adapt for can be weight and body water % (I use a smart scale that automatically calibrates this info to my health app), weather (like a reminder to drink extra water on a hot day), and consumption of diuretic drinks as logged into the app. If the developers can incorporate these features into the app then they would really have a complete app that stands out from the rest."
"4887",653031147,"Does exactly what I want it to do."
"4888",653508448,"This is a great game I like everything about it But the only reason I put 4 is for the vanosgaming and his friends it’s just to much gems they should changed it to gold But it’s a very great app if is free to great game"
"4889",653508448,"Son una abuela de 65 años y estoy en este juego para compartir con mi nieto que tiene 7 años , ,el me aconseja y me dice cómo jugar, me divierte este juego"
"4890",653508448,"I love your game"
"4891",653967729,"This app is amazing"
"4892",653967729,"This game is great! It does what it says it does but I would definitely like to see a kid section with things kids know. I am 9 and I don’t know most of the things in the categories. I don’t know if it’s just me or not but this is a really good game for free!"
"4893",653967729,"Good game but could you add Spanish as a language."
"4894",654662054,"This app is great in theory but the execution leaves much to be desired. The stats feature doesn’t work at all, and it’s confusing and complicated to add tasks."
"4895",654662054,"This app is okay, but I had trouble navigating the app. It’s hard to explain, but it looked like there may have been some glitches. For example, opportunities where I should have been able to select icons to add a task, or go to the timer, and tapping the icons did nothing. But they weren’t grayed out or anything—suggesting those buttons should have been active on those pages. And if they were, in fact, inactive buttons and that’s how the app is suppose to work, then definitely don’t bother with it. Too complex."
"4896",654662054,"I hate this!"
"4897",654810212,"Honestly this workout app is perfect for me: I'm not an intense worker outer, I feel uncomfortable at the gym, I don't own any workout material and I've never liked working out. The stay at home body weight model is right up my alley. The intensity level is also spot on—not too light that I feel I've done nothing and not too intense that I find myself swearing under my breath the entire time and hating life. I am getting the cardio I need on a weekly basis and I enjoy the exercises and how I feel after. I've never enjoyed working out in my life! So way to go Freeletics. You helped me to like it more.   One thing though... The #%^*$&@ deep squat stretch for 120 seconds??? Every single other cool down exercise is relaxing and blissful and only lasts between 30 and 60 seconds. But the $&@% deep squat stretch lasts 120 #%^*$&@ SECONDS?!?! I need a cool down just for that cool down which is harder than the workout itself! ... Good grief.   Other than that, no complaints. :) Also, you shouldn't call yourselves Freeletics since there isn't even a free version of this app... am I wrong?"
"4898",654810212,"I’ve started a training program and after completing the day 2 workouts at the bottom of the workout detail view it says 75% complete - finish day. But I don’t know what that means, and it was 48 hours ago so I’m not sure how else to finish the day?"
"4899",654810212,"I never wrote any app review before, but I have to point out this app has bugs when I try to register at the beginning. I was using my FB login, and it keeps back and forth from my FB to this app several times but still can’t move to next step. That’s really annoying me. Finally move into fill out personal info then the birthday I put in was different as it appears. Then I cannot move to next step again. So I deleted this app immediately without even know what it’s inside."
"4900",655890150,"Do not advertise for your other apps THAT I ALREADY BOUGHT in the app that’s $20. Unreal."
"4901",655890150,"After Back To My Mac was deprecated I was looking for an alternative to remote to my Mac remotely. Found this app and paid for both the iOS and Mac versions. Have absolutely no complaints, everything works as it should!"
"4902",655890150,"I honestly cant see myself not having it!"
"4903",656176278,"The controls are difficult for me. I am left handed, please add a left handed option"
"4904",656176278,"Pero los controles son malos"
"4905",656176278,"Is to addictive that I just downloaded because my brother like sports games ⚽️🏀and see him playing this game that I said let try it now I play more cause I’m a shooting game fan ....."
"4906",656723874,"Bad it’s not scary or really original. controls are wierd and can’t open doors"
"4907",656723874,"Home is a good game conceptually but spins too wide and open of a web to really capture my imagination. At the end you are left with essentially no reward for everything you did other than more confusion. I suppose their is a literary style that this is based on but the best authors like Poe still manage to capture your imagination, your horror, your mind and give you the finish. So in the end you are left with just your thoughts here instead. And there is no possible story which fits all the variables provided within. Please continue to write though. The App Store needs more unique tales like this. One suggestion to the player: definitely try and dedicate time to this start to finish. A lot gets lost if you play it 30 mins at a time. Good luck!"
"4908",656723874,"It was a lot of aimless searching/discovery and I never felt truly invested enough to care. I typically like games that offer a different approach, but this left a lot to be desired.   I encourage the developer to keep at it, but I do regret making this purchase."
"4909",656951157,"Honestly this is the greatest iPhone game I’ve ever played. I remember downloading it when it first came out, and I just recently downloaded it again. Still after a year, I completely love everything about this game. It flows smoothly, and it’s challenge yet simplistic. Overall just great."
"4910",656951157,"This game is one of the best games I’ve ever played I love it it’s worth the price and is just a really good game there’s a bunch of thinking and problem solving I highly recommend getting the game."
"4911",656951157,"Thank you Martin Stig for complimenting this game with a magical soundtrack!"
"4912",656971078,"Do not put it on games that are kid friendly when yours is not kid friendly take this note surious"
"4913",656971078,"I love episodes but I hate when I go in family vacations that don’t have no WiFi I hope that you guyz make it so that we can download it and read when we don’t have Service"
"4914",656971078,"i like this game but i dont like that you need diomonds for options it would be so much more fun if the options where free~Estefania"
"4915",657189652,"It’s a great way to track periods and symptoms.  However, after a year of use (I have a semi-irregular cycle and I’m not on the pill), it still fails to correctly predict my cycle.  But I suppose that’s the definition of irregular.  Would be nice if it were at least close at this point, after a whole year of tracking..."
"4916",657189652,"I love the app! Been using it for over 3yrs and it just keeps getting better and better with the new updates. Definitely recommend it:)"
"4917",657189652,"I really like this app, it’s very useful and accurate...the upgrade is a bit expensive for me 😧 but yeah! If you can get it, go for it...I’ll recommend it 👍🏼"
"4918",657395017,"I bought the board game to play on our next game night and decided to get this app to play several games ahead of time.  They have a nice tutorial video and good rules section.  If you are new to the game I would review these and play on the easiest level (one below Novice) which is unique to this app with less bad cards and is almost a sure win.  Remember there is an Undo button in case you click on the wrong button.  I have been playing on the Novice level which was a 50/50 chance of winning or better until I hit all four of the Storm Beats Down (SBD) in six cards which was sure death in two straight games.   In my next ten games I had all four SBD a few times in eight cards and nine cards.   It can't seem to get a good shuffle lately.  I just hope the game wii eventually get out of this cycle.  Having my Water Bearer die three straight games of thirst almost had me delete this game.  I really like this game and hope my experience isn't normal."
"4919",657395017,"Game is great, but can’t listen to anything while I play it, real bummer"
"4920",657395017,"This game has 5 different levels of difficulty. Level 1 you should win every time. Level 2 you may win about 50% of the time. Level 3 you might win 1 out of every 100 games so roughly 1% success rate. Level 4 and 5 you better be able to accept that you’ll never win... Regardless it is insanely fun to play. I prefer level 3 myself, but get use to losing."
"4921",657500465,"I’m sure you will love love and you always always happy happy with happy happy family happy happy love love you and love"
"4922",657500465,"Ads"

"4925",657638474,"needs to be updated.  It wont even load because its not updated to the latest iOS"
"4926",657638474,"I just really, really wish I could listen to music while I play."
"4927",657675944,"Liked the game. Animation and music when Selling my piggies was worth 4stars"
"4928",657675944,"I like it, so cute"
"4929",657675944,"Cute piglets!"
"4930",657811530,"I like it so much"
"4931",657811530,"I caught Lums saying “Luigi”"
"4932",657811530,"I really like this game because of how different it feels.I really liked Jungle Run, but I prefer Fiesta Run.The level design is so innovative and imaginative and the graphics look amazing.Rayman Legends has similar graphics.Each stage isn’t too hard or too simplified.If you’re looking for a great mobile platformer,Rayman Fiesta Run is for you."
"4933",658257516,"I am trying to get live coverage of the Final Group on the app and you keep covering the next to last groups! What’s with that!? 🙄"
"4934",658257516,"Have to pay to see any live coverage but then you still need to see advertisements"
"4935",658257516,"I don’t understand anyone giving this a high rating. It works but that’s it.  It offers a page for tee times but then doesn’t give the tee times. Just group numbers and who’s in the group.  Useless. And somehow it just disappeared off my phone. By itself. The other majors had great apps. Why bother if you’re not going to do it right."
"4936",658785238,"ドラマやテレビの内容を人と共有したいタイプなので、このアプリで人と実況しながら話せるのはすごい楽しいとおもいます！"

"4940",658828559,"Beat the AI on the first try. It started with a 4 - 1 move and I beat it. I wish I could play people on line."
"4941",658828559,"I love this game.  I first saw it played everywhere in East Africa where it is called “Bau.”  Men would sometimes even make a board in the dirt and play using stones or seeds.  I bought a very beautiful, hand carved board but never learned how to play it. This online version is easy to learn and so much fun to play."
"4942",659283309,"I can’t even play the game every time I load up the game it just crashes pls fix this annoying glitch"
"4943",659283309,"The game it’s self is a lot of fun. But it seems like they’re always trying to make you buy buy buy. They want you to buy tons of gyms and are always shoving adds in your face. This causes the game to drag and get old quickly"
"4944",659283309,"In app purchases ruin everything fun about gaming. Great for those who are garbage and benefit from the pay to win crap they sell today.."

"4948",659425518,"I love this game, but it lacks story. The story is so short. I don’t know how you would update the story and make it bigger, but you definitely should."
"4949",659425518,"I bought a ton of stuff and then yesterday it all disappeared I had almost every bout in the game except for gold Zeus. I am so mad. Otherwise it is a great game. Please fix these problems and restore my stuff"

"4951",659448144,"Now I used to adore this app but the pancake counting soon got a little boring… after you counted all ten pancakes it would make you do it all over again. They could have done a better job on that like sort them by color or put the pancakes in order. But no making you count all over again come on sagomini…🙄"
"4952",659448144,"My 3 year old daughter Luna loves this game! I just bought it for her and I said”when it’s your screen time you can play it” she was not happy about that! But when it was screen time she was playing on it a lot! 5 stars!"
"4953",659448144,"It’s for kids"
"4954",659672658,"Great App. All the info I need. Maybe a twitter feed as well as the news feed? Option to play music? One piece that would be a huge help for me would be the ability to cast to my TV. Something I can look at as I get ready in the mornings."
"4955",659672658,"I wanted to love this app. I needed it very much. But while it is good at the things it does, it simply is missing too much.  1. You have to use every box. I’d rather allow one info piece span two or more boxes. I don’t need stocks or news. But because I have to use every box I either have to use these options or repeat other info prices.   2. Calendar needs to list more than just a single days events. Option to have a Today box and a Upcoming box for events would be great.  3. Color options. The blue is wonderful, but I’d rather have it black. Only allowing a single color is not ideal."

Like another reviewer we took an old iPad and now have a helpful display of info.  I just wish the weather display would show the 10 day forecast.  And I’d like to have more and better theme choices.

Two out of 4 buttons DONT WORK (using Steel Series Nimbus, which work flawlessly is ANY other app) when I can get the game to play at all, which is for about 7-10 seconds before I get kicked back to the main screen. So, sadly, please do not buy until fixed. 7/26/2019"

And it’s great because you can call, days months hours and minutes before Christmas!! you can edit your childs profile if they are  naughty there fav color ect!!! There are also games so it’s not boring! I know Santa isn’t real,atleast I think.....but I love to believe in him for the spirit and just because it’s fun! There are also other reason but it’s to many. You should download this app! Before bed on Christmas Eve,I always check the tracker and make cookies or something else sweet with a glass of milk! Last year, I gave him donuts!! This year I’m gonna give him Cinnamon Buns! Again,I love this app and I really recommend it! Have a early Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I’m gonna download it nowwww! :D"

I played and beat EPOCH 1, but it won't let me use the O.G.R.E Turret. I keep trying to get it but it won't work. I would be very happy if someone told me what to do."
"4967",660982355,"Also your EPOCH.2 app is crashing on me every year! I guest you just wants money so you can buy a house. Your games always crash on me. I try everything else but they didn't work. Don't ask me to search up on website like ""how to fix the crash problem?"" Well they don't work after all. Your problem is here so you crash, you fix it. Your game, you fix it. And your responsibilities, you got to deal with it. I guest every one is angry at you for making this stupid crash game."

"4980",662569685,"Sorry people / authors / code writers, etc., I apologize for not reviewing “Riptide GP2” sooner. I’m 65 yrs. old and I’ve been totally engrossed in this darn game since I uploaded it. I guess if you people didn’t make it so good I would have done a review earlier. I should turn you over to the DEA because you’re game, “Riptide GP2”, is addictive and I’m totally dependent on it for a thrill, it’s a BLAST! I just got carried away with the races, scenery, live action waves jumps and everything else that I kept on putting it off, (for about five years) but here is my review."
"4981",663068211,"Wouldn’t be so bad if they didn’t intentionally ignore the user preference where I explicitly declined rating-nags.  What do I owe people who thumb their noses at my clearly-indicated preference?"
"4982",663068211,"The concept and general gameplay is really great but the satellite mission controls don’t seem to work quite right.  Four control thrusters are required to yaw because it uses the left/right thruster to do this motion. This can just as easily be achieved with the forward/rear thrusters utilizing only two.  The above issue causes several problems. 1) Uses fuel quicker. 2) Requires an understanding of center of balance when there are no indicators where that could possibly be. No weights or dimensions of the parts are provided much less an accurate tool to locate the thrusters on the correct part of the body. This results in unintended yaw when trying to maneuver left and right which causes unintended yaw.  Additionally, there is no way to turn the control thrusters off for other portions of the flight. This means your burning control thruster fuel the entire flight and by the time you’ve aligned with the satellite you’re low or out of control thruster fuel.   Finally, the controls for fine maneuvering do not respond correctly. The forward button works as intended, tap it, hold it and the ship moves as you would expect. The back, left, right, and yaw controls don’t. You have to hold them down before that do anything, at which point they start burning hard, creating uncontrolled movement.  Add this together and it turns “challenging” into wholly frustrating.  I am loath to try the Simple Planes as I imagine it relies heavily on The maneuvering controls and would have related issues."
"4983",663068211,"I can’t wait for simple rockets 2 But other than that, this is amazing  Great way to challenge yourself to reach for the stars  In my case, literally, I try to fly into the sun  Also sadly my iPad is a mini 2 so it can’t run sr2 😭"
"4984",663547503,"One of my favorite games, got to wave 37 on my old phone. But I got a new phone and now it’s unplayable because whenever I try to move my minions to another job it closes my app or switches to another app. Please update the game to find a way to fix this."
"4985",663547503,"This was such a fun game. One star because it’s impossible to play with the way app switching works now."
"4986",663547503,"This is a great game that I’ve had a lot of fun with over the years. The UI is extremely frustrating on iPhone X as it overlaps the home swipe up gesture. I would love it if you could refresh the UI to solve this issue."
"4987",664425773,"you morons updated this app now you can’t send photos from the scanner to the phone without going thru an hours worth of crap i am so tired of this i am going to buy a new printer scanner and this was the best printer i ever had but now it might as well be a boat anchor"

GOOD LUCK"
"4991",664575829,"Zero stars is more appropriate. If all you have is an extra five minutes to play a game then this is for you. Don’t get it expecting to play while you wait for anything because minutes is all you get before your lives run out. Then it’s 2.5 hrs to get all five back. The computer makes sure you don’t win too much and stacks the games against you by making sure theres only one or two of the colors you need. You have the chance to win unlimited lives. When you do, you will get it at midnight when you don’t have time to play. Most of the time, you will be forced into competitions against 50 people where only the top 10 get a prize. The top 3 are the only valuable prizes. But good luck getting there because you won’t have enough lives to score enough points. Then you get demoted! They make it so frustrating and hard to win! I will NEVER download ANYTHING from this company again! Don’t forget they hound you over and over for reviews! Not just one review, they want hundreds from you! BEWARE!!!  Also check the developer responses! They’re the same for each bad review. Gosh, they really got the customer service thing down!!"

"5008",666508823,"Game is fantastic, dont get me wrong. But what really made me stop playing it is the skills and how they slowmo everything once you activate one. It becomes really annoying to a point i just cant handle it. If you could make an option where i can switch off the skills animation or the semi-lock slowmo effect of skills it would be great. I’ll re-install it right now to be honest. If not, then maybe think of this suggestion for your upcoming game. There is just no way i’m ever playing a game with this mechanic."

"5020",667728512,"I played GoW fire age until It became to fast and glitchy. It was constant new drops and upgrades. Hi not catering to the big spenders(platinum players). When MZ came out with GoW dragon dimension lots of us started playing there because it was like the old GoW. The gameplay was more slow like the original GoW that everyone loved. But now it’s all about the platinum players and constant new drops. Game full of glitches and lag is crazy bad during events. MZ is losing players by the thousands daily.  We have tried communicating with them but they don’t seem to care. I won’t be playing much longer if MZ doesn’t try to fix all the problems with gameplay. 😡"
"5021",667728512,"I have played for years.  It’s true that it’s free to play, but requires you to buy packs to keep current. Every time something is added, glitches in the game follow.  Lag during major events, glitches, no notifications, and cost are big negatives. Every time they add something new, requires buying many packs to achieve. Packs cost for packs is ridiculous at $99 each.  Don’t recommend game to new players.  Spend money on tangible objects!"
"5022",667728512,"Played this game for years when it wasn’t all about the money. Now you have to take a loan out from the bank just to compete. Mz is a trash company and only cares about money, not the players at all. Don’t waste your time folks or hard earned money."

Please do not remove this app each one of ur applications are unique in their own ways  One more thing for the latest update on djay uv made that into a monthly subscription, please make those effects and goodies into a one time investment for the consumers and fans for instance while buying the packs and it will be a one time thing but it turns out to be a monthly subscription it doesn’t make me feel like wanting to take all that hassle and run a subscription for a hobby that i try to use daily but might use those extra stuff occasionally.

"5053",671464704,"I used to love this game.  Been playing since the very beginning.   Let’s start with this morning.  I waited about 20 minutes to be matched into a 3v3 ranked game.  When I finally got into a game, I was matched with players that we so bad(or trolls) that it wasn’t worth playing.   What’s going on? Is the player base too small for all the game options they offer? It’s a great game but I can’t wait that long and then be matched up with lvl players that are too good or to bad.   Please fix this. Get rid of the least popular game options. Hopefully that will offset the reduced player base.  It might reinvigorate your existing players and bring some back into the mix.   Update 9/13/19 I really want to love this game again, but it’s taking longer and longer to get into a match. And when I do the teams are so  Uneven.  9/18 update  Ugh  I tried to play this morning and it took 15 minutes to get matched."

"5056",671867510,"I love this app. It’s fun to draw and paint with. I have used this for several years now and it still freezes up and crashes. I really hope that the developers will address this."
"5057",671867510,"Every project crashes the app. No way to use it. Whatever update was installed just made it useless."
"5058",671867510,"This is a great app that I’ve used for many personal projects and even school pieces. I’ve done lots of drawings, paintings, and photo retouches. However, along with the retouches comes a drop in resolution. When importing photos in, the app will lower the pixel count to fit its minimum resolution. It’s a little inconvenient whether it’s for retouches or mixed media. So, the only thing I’d really like to see change in is the option to zoom into photos way closer; until I can see the pixels of an HD photo. This would also mean that the app would have to be able to handle more pixels from the high res photos. This is not an app meant for photos but in the case of art, I’d like to be able to better incorporate this feature through mixed media. Otherwise, it’s a great app that I’ve been using for a couple years. If you enjoy drawing or even photo editing, I’d really recommend that you buy this upgrade."

"5062",672002602,"As other reviews mentioned, seems a tiny bit off on a few of the puzzles. The design itself is very ... if you don’t get it you’re just sort of flailing without recourse, and the back and forward buttons are super annoying to use to traverse prior puzzles. But I enjoyed it mostly. For $3? Yeah, get it. An interesting look at a different type of word/novel/puzzle game. :)"
"5063",672002602,"The concept of the game is fun and original. The game itself is pretty dull. Not a lot of clever; not a lot of fun. The cute little twists all leave something to be desired, I think because the medium itself—like a worse kind of crossword—is sorely lacking. The plot, which is really the only thing worth keeping on for, isn't worth keeping on for at all; it's a heavy-handed, childish take on a dystopian government, the sort of thing a teen comes up with after reading 1984. The characters are shallow, the Evil Government is boring, and the one attempt at tugging your heartstrings manages to be simultaneously melodramatic and boring.   This is not a good game, for all it was created by a great guy."

Unsatisfied with a game I was so curious about for so long. I love a good dystopian story, but the gameplay was disappointing."
"5065",672150402,"Best mobile strategy game. DO NOT INSTALL if you have things to do at work. You will loose your job, be homeless living behind a public library or anywhere with free WiFi."
"5066",672150402,"It’s a throw away strategy game like all the others; however you get matched against players that treat it like a high stakes game of Risk. So instead of a nice quick match I get paired up against orientals that map out the attack, use slow troops and then delay the end of their attack for no reason except to spite me because I have defeated their poor logic. So their attacks take 4-5 times longer than mine and I can’t do anything but wait for them to finish and wonder why they did so much planning and still failed."

"5068",672175251,"So I paid a one time fee for the app before downloading it. Cool  Then the app tells me in order to unlock the rest of the recipes I have to pay again Ehh,  But I did it  NOW the app is telling me I have to pay a monthly fee to use the meal planning feature  3rd strike Whoever said this app “Nickle and dimes” you was 100% correct  Not worth it, the recipes are average too (in my opinion)  But to be fair I do like the layout of the app, and how intuitive and convenient the shopping feature list is"
"5069",672175251,"I thought I was buying a tracker, where I could input what I am eating with guidance to eat the paleo way.  Instead it’s just a bunch of recipes predetermined for you unless you want to pay AGAIN!  I’m disappointed for sure."

"5072",672828590,"Could be fun but, after short training, there is nowhere to practice and perfect you skills. Start playing and you go against higher skilled players. Example: As a new  just downloaded player, I played just two days, got to Level 8. I tried to play today, and get matched up against Level 97? This is every game I play, go against much much more skilled levels. Higher skilled players know more of what they are doing, I am still fumbling with how to do things...Doesn’t seem quite fair. Also, I’ve earned coin that I can’t figure out what to do with it. To upgrade to better clubs, balls, etc, you need to spend real $. Why do that when I don’t know how best to use them??"

I can't fix a room so now I'm trying to delete it. How do I do that?!!!  Learning curve is steep. Edits are not natural. Rooms attach at wrong place and couldn't figure out how to fix it. Very frustrating."

"5085",673673795,"I really like the idea of this app.  Measure a room and then create a 3d model using pictures of the actual room.  Reason I can’t give it more than 2 stars right now are: * Learning curve.  Tough to figure out how things work without spending a lot of time figuring it out * 3D picture map stops working half way through.  Starts off really fast and then just stops collecting pictures and I end up with an unusable 3D model.  Maybe not enough memory being allocated for the rendering of the pictures?  I would rather have a full room at less resolution than 6 square feet of useless high quality floor pictures. * Wish it was a little more accurate in measuring.  I don’t expect it to ever replace my trusty laser measurer but it is sometime off by more than a foot.  Also never gets room height correct."

"5095",675628523,"Don’t get me wrong, this is a really good app. It just, idk if this is just me, that I have to keep constantly exporting the skins I want to pe, because after awhile they stop working? Like, when I go to change the skin, I’ll tap the picture and the little thing will pop up, but it’s invisible. And it doesn’t show up when you select the skin, it’ll just keep the skin you had previously on. Which I guess wouldn’t be THAT bad, but you have to watch an ad Every. Single. Time you save/export it. I can deal with some ads, that’s understandable, it’s just every single time can get annoying. Also, you REALLY need some more child safe precautions here. I haven’t seen anything really bad yet, but in other reviews I’ve seen, it can get bad. Maybe also add in a way so where you can report stuff? It’s mostly children that will use this app, so please pay more attention to that. It’s a really big issue. But, besides that, this is a really good app"

Very very disappointed. And that's happened more than once. Then you end up with 20 dups of the same base and no way to trade them up like other topps apps. Just to frustrating.  Update: same odds issue persists in the 18/19 release.   Update: Kick 20 is another epic letdown. Having thousand of EPL cards to trade ... but you can’t trade them. No explanation on why that is, though we all know topps lost the rights.  That totally stinks. Ok, no new cards but not allowed to trade old ones???  I really pitty the fools that spent real money on those.   The trade feed is drying up.  This app might be into a slow death spiral."

"5122",680366065,"Engaging, beautifully designed, very challenging puzzle and logic game.  Fascinating plot, if not a bit twisted.  You should definitely buy this game!"
"5123",680366065,"I gave it 4 stars so I did quite like it despite what I am going to write.  First, gorgeously done with regard to the linking of narrative and movement. Best part of the game. But I use the word “game” guardedly (which I suspect the authors might agree with). If you are looking for The Room level puzzles, this is not the place. Some clever mechanics but not overly challenging.  Second, the audio is wonderfully done and adds a wonderful richness to the experience.  Lastly, the ending is weak. I am not sure if there is more than 1 ending so I was going to go through it again. But the one I got was less than satisfying. There are plenty of common tropes that could have worked better.  So in summary, a as game it is so-so, as an experience it is excellent."
"5124",680366065,"This game is amazing and you should get it. Review done. 😁  Need more?  I LOVE these kinds of games and play as many as I can.  This game entranced me like no other game has been able to do. The storytelling is great and gameplay is the most unique I’ve ever played.  The puzzles were the perfect level of difficulty.   Enough gushing. Just play it."

"5126",680733772,"I got this game for my Apple TV because it looked interesting and I was bored, plus I had the controller so why not? It didn’t take long for me to realize that it plays and works EXACTLY like Contest of Champions, the RNG factor of obtaining heroes the “quests” that require energy and single round one on one combat that is punch kick to build your power until you can use a skill that actually relates to the character and what they are known for. The fact that I can own 4 versions of the same chapter because of how many stars it has and the fact I can’t promote a two star to a three star, I just have to hope my next crystal, I mean orb, gives me the higher star version of the character I want. Quest exploration, quest completion, chapter and act completion rewards, iso-8 to level up your character.... oops I mean Ichor, that comes in 75, 125 and higher values to provide more xp. I do not like this set up at all, in fact I rage quit MCOC after I idiotically spent $100 trying to get a specific 4 star character because I could let rank high enough in PvP Tournaments to earn it, and got nothing but 2 and 3 star rat feces characters.... I’m older and wiser now and have no real investment in these characters so that part is fine, but I don’t actually like the game play.... its ridiculous that Zeus slaps you about a bit before he’s even capable of chunking some lightning at you. And when it happens you just mash a button... no combos like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter (⬇️↘️➡️🅱️) just hit Y and it does the special attack for you... no skill or practice needed just button mash and block on time. I prefer the game play in Marvel Future Fight, where skips are always available for you to use, even if they have a cool down. Anyway, I will say I like the “graphics” for this better because they aren’t afraid of a little skin, no matter who you like to look at. That being said, if you like the game style of Marvel’s Contest of Champions, or you are familiar with it, when you play this you’ll see it is literally just a new skin for that exact very game, I forgot to mention class bonuses, and colors, it’s literally a photo copy Of that game down to the minute detail... oddly enough from a different developer: Gameloft vs Kabam, did someone get fired and go work for Gameloft?). If you like that game, which I don’t, then you’ll like this."

After just a couple of day using it I started feeling more relaxed and calm. I’m still using it and will definitely be using it for a long time.  One thing I didn’t like is that it weighs 500MB and takes ages to sync after installing. However, the benefits are still there and it is worth the space, time and money."

"5170",687888390,"République is a classy offering, a thoughtful, well-made game, and worth every cent. Obtain the full pass. I have only one caution to promote:  I fully enjoyed nearly every moment of this game. The scene on the ship spoiled it for me. I choose to stick to clean language, and the “G” bomb at the end (along with a few other instances) puts drag on the overall experience.  A lot of major films do this—a lot of writers feel that it adds potency to a moment to drop profanity. I do understand that my preference differs from that of others, and I respect the right of others to express themselves how they choose.  That said, and aside from the profanity, République deserves all the success it can stand, and Camoflaj and Logan games deserve a thick paycheck and kudos.  Well done, except for the kitchen sink!"

"5172",687888390,"Hey developers!!! I LOVE this game! Played through episode 1, and have absolutely loved it. Didn’t have any problems, that is, until I tried to start up episode 2. It let me watch the short clip, but the moment I click on the camera to move from the phone to the rest of the game, it quits. I don’t lose my progress, but I haven’t been able to progress any further. Again, love the game, and I’ll change my review to a 5 star as soon as the bug has been fixed. Thanks for creating such an awesome game. Please, please, PLEASE fix this."
"5173",688285246,"Bought this one a while back and completed it once. Picked it back up recently and I can honestly say that I have no idea why I put it down. The combat is challenging but not overdone, the story is genuinely enjoyable and, well I just liked the game."

"5177",688319243,"This app used to be awesome but since the updates it crashes during editing constantly.  This NEEDS to be fixed immediately. I’m on an iPhone XS Max OS 12.4  I would recommend it, but until it stops crashing, I am unsure why I am paying for it."

I was sadly mistaken. The app on the iPad had less feature and cost $5.99 compared to what I paid for the phone version which was $3.99. Please add more features or at least what your phone version have. I REALLY WANT THIS UPDATED ASAP"
"5180",688831692,"I absolutely love Facetune! I’ve used it to edit everything from fashion shots to landscape photography, and the results are phenomenal every time!  One of my favorite things about Facetune is the control it gives you over every tool. Many apps these days have a sort of “smart” function that tries to apply it for you, resulting in over- or under-application more often than not. Facetune, on the other hand, lets you hand-select where to apply any tool, as well as the strength, which allows for more natural-looking edits that, honestly, look better. Overall, this is well-worth the money and I would recommend!"

"5183",688983474,"finally took this test for the 1st time ever & my last...i thought the questions would be about the world/history/science/match etc... & that i would probably get a low score..so answered them honestly, no paper/pen/checking online...scored 134😱😱😱... should have taken this at night when my 9month old baby is in bed but overall i am very happy with the results...highly recommended...thanks!!!"
"5184",688983474,"It was genuinely easy at first and then really difficult towards the end."
"5185",689165391,"Love the no ads and learning portion of the app but don’t think LGBT needs to be shoved down my 4 year olds throat. I need to watch a littler closer when she’s on this app because when she should be innocently learning she’s instead asking questions that her little mind isn’t yet ready for."
"5186",689165391,"Keeping an extremely active four year old grandchild when you are over seventy can be quite a challenge. He loves HOPSTER and the programs are very good. We watch it together as we take a much needed break, several times a day."

"5191",689859603,"I read this app was easy to use and had a lot of what I was looking for-UNFORTUNATELY THE APP WOULDN'T EVEN ALLOW ME TO GET TO MY PHOTOS OR VIDEOS! I HAD A SCREEN THAT ASKS PHOTO OR VIDEO,IT ONLY ALLOWED ME TO CHOOSE PHOTOS AND WHEN THAT WAS THE ONLY BUTTON ON THE SCREEN....the second I hit it,it pops out of the app and to my home screen! OVER AND OVER! Don’t waste your time and energy!"
"5192",689859603,"Great app"
"5193",689859603,"Love this app. Have made several little shows and always get wonderful compliments from my friends and family on them."
"5194",689936776,"I think this is a good game, but I think it should be free. There’s not that much to do but knock things over and build our own town using the toys they already have. It’s not worth buying this game."
"5195",689936776,"#1 it’s a pretty small map.  #2 you can’t build very much.  #3 you don’t have a very good view when your in the car so you can’t see were your going.  #4 when you touch the trash can to delete stuff it zooms in so you can’t see very much.  #5 not much to do it’s just kinda boring.  #6 needs better controls.  But other than those things the animation is pretty good"

"5202",690602681,"Great app."
"5203",690802539,"Would be a great app if the sound worked."
"5204",690802539,"I was hoping to have my son practice listening to sounds but it’s not working. I hope you could fix this. Seems like the intention in creating this app is great but the app itself crashes."
"5205",690802539,"It seems like a good idea but I wish it was a big better. My ENL student gets confused when he slices a letter and the game says a letter that’s different from what he sliced. I agree. It’s good, but could be better."
"5206",690852527,"I started playing your game Cascade several years back I loved it . but when it ask me to watch a movie for different rewards I would watch the movie  , then after I watch the movie the frame froze up and I would have to exit the game to get it to unfreeze. And no reward.  So I quit playing for a long time. I just started up again playing. But the same problem would happen over and over again. It’s to bad Cascade was my favorite game."
"5207",690852527,"I’ve played this game for years and have loved it. Over the past couple of months, though, the game makes me load new content and then load my progress (separately) EVERY TIME I load the game. This means I have to waste time several times a day. It also won’t load if I’m not on great WiFi. I’ve started migrating to other games to play because of this. Fix it, and I’ll be back..."
"5208",690852527,"I’ve played this game for years and I am currently on level 1598. It has always been slow to load but  I have excepted this. But now the game is lagging and it can take several minutes to complete one move that would usually take seconds. The only way to get around this is to exit game and go back in which means that you lose your progress on that level.  At this time it is unplayable"
"5209",691102150,"This game is like temple run but not really and I like this game because this is so much fun to play"
"5210",691102150,"There was a finish platform at 7:28 and it then didn't record that I beat my old record of 6:20"
"5211",691102150,"The swipe controls while responsive take time. Which is good for early levels in classic but is terrible for later ones as the speed is increased The tap controls are absolutely terrible. Tapping one side of the screen should send you that side but if you miss the absolute side you are sent flipping. Simply put the tap controls are too unforgiving with switching lanes The computer version is the definitive version as the controls are solid and it works for people who left and right handed perfectly I would have thought that with the CPU version we would not have crappy controls in the phone version. Advice make an update where tapping both sides of the screen flips the map not the center and give complete lane switching to tapping one side of the screen."
"5212",691121579,"Doesn’t even block ads that take you to different sites. You’ll try to click on a video to watch it and  another tab opens up talking about non-sense. Waste of money does not work"

"5216",691797987,"Missing some key feature for no reason compared to the Android version. Two most notable are the ability to re-arrange your queue and the Equalizer. I also constantly experience crashing after a few weeks of use. Clearing the cache doesn't fix it; I always have to uninstall and reinstall the app. In CarPlay it's unusable. The nav doesn't even show up about 80%+ of the time. If you tap where a nav item should be you get an error message about ""(null)."" (I don't remember the exact message but that's part of it), there's no way to view the queue, no way to shuffle or repeat, no way to thumbs up or down, and when you select a playlist - on the rare occasion the nav works - the playlist fails to load if it has more than a couple handfuls of songs. Basically you have to use the app on your phone if you're going to use Play Music because it doesn't work in CarPlay and when it does it's so limited you can't do what you wanted to do anyway."
"5217",691797987,"I’m starting to dislike this app more and more. You can’t easily organize things and more importantly, songs keep getting deleted from my library without my knowledge. I’m sick of it. I don’t know how many songs I’m missing now. I’m switching to Spotify or something"
"5218",692412579,"Bonus levels are too hard to win.   It’s impossible to earn bonuses for building the town."
"5219",692412579,"I enjoy the game and enjoy the side games in Arendelle.  But, when it comes to Elsa’s special games it is really frustrating. I won’t use any of my power ups nor waste my extra lives because the developers have made those games impossible to complete.  I love trying the games but when you make it to level 4 and lose and have to start at the beginning, makes me not want to play them."
"5220",692412579,"This game is sooo much less annoying than candy crush!  It’s the same basic idea, but it’s way better!  Love it!"
"5221",692669501,"The game charged me 49.99 and then tried to charge me 99.99 and I quickly closed it to prevent it from charging all that money I contacted their service and they asked to sell items and keep gems and shards and crystals for deductions and that was never done I contacted and they came up with their excuse that they couldn’t give me the refund because I used a castle pack which I sold and then got one from another purchase and they said that because I used one it counted as used on their part seriously they just took 49.99 out of my card and made a excuse to keep it."
"5222",692669501,"-1 star simply pay to win -3 stars can no longer connect to the server regardless of WiFi of data  can’t play if I can’t connect to the server"
"5223",692669501,"Now I love this game but I have two suggestions to make it better. 1.  I think it would be nice to be able to clear your save and start again but you are able to go back as if you were on a different device. 2. I think it would be awesome if you could trade heroes, gems, coins, honor badges, shards, and more with other people. This would add an extra element to the rest of the game so I and other players could enjoy it even more.  Please implement these ideas into the game in the future.  Thank you, and goodbye."
"5224",693045097,"Τα κατάφερες πολύ καλά! Λατρεύω το παιχνίδι"
"5225",693045097,"Can’t wait to see the sequel from you guys, and also thank you for constantly updating and improving this one."
"5226",693045097,"Imaginative story, I guess, but it’s too hard to interact with the game. It looks pretty good, but doesn’t play well. Sometimes I’ve tried things that don’t work but the game hints indicate that’s exactly what you’re supposed to do. Challenge is about identifying obscure things like a conveyer belt in a dark room. Gave up. Lots better games, I'm sorry to say."
"5227",693689912,"I am a child using this app.I use this app at school and home for homework. I hate one thing though.The submit button is on the bottom and you can hit when you are not done with your answer.Its very stress full  when your on problem 99 and, oh no! I hit the Summit button when i was still working and I’m on problem 86 now! Please consider this and find a better place to have everything."
"5228",693689912,"My daughter loves it!"
"5229",693689912,"So ever since my mom forced me to use this I’ve been hating it. So does my brother. It bumps you back when you get it wrong. On a test does that happen it doesn’t bump you back on a test. A suggestion is after you do it you can try to redo it and it could tell you your before and after but IXL  please make this horrible app better. And my mom also agrees but it’s the only app we can find.if it was 1to5 I can’t but it’s a absolute 0  Ps this will probably make your child rage quit"
"5230",694047660,"Simple to use. Caters for everything you'll need to do. Good report templates too. Took a while for me to get the hang of it but after I did, it's been a breeze.   Only shortcoming, if it could be considered that is that there is no Mac version although there is a PC version.  The app has recently moved to a subscription model for synchronization across this devices. Before now, I could synchronize across my devices - iPhone and iPad but since I now had to pay I decided to stick with using it only on my iPhone, which I’d most likely have around and about me anyways. Yesterday, after updating the app the day before, I recorded my transactions by clicking on the daily reminder that pops up if you haven’t entered any record that day. Surprise of all surprise, today I open the app to find ALL my records gone - no wallets, no expenses, no income, absolutely nothing! Worse of all, I have no back up of years of records due to their recent subscription model to back up online.  Now, I have to find another budgetting app."
"5231",694047660,"The app is easy to use and very challenging convenient.  Wish there were more options foe expense categories."
"5232",694047660,"I tried a lot of budget and planning apps and thought there was nothing there that had everything i needed.  I had to settle with a couple of apps and was already using it for two months.  But it was really frustrating me and it was not making my budgeting easy. So i looked and found this! It had everything i needed.  The only thing I didnt like was the fact that I didnt know that I had to pay extra for some of the functions I needed.  But they are not expensive, so it was fine for me.  After purchasing the ones i needed, i only spent a little less than five dollars. And i love the app!  It’s helping me budget, plan, and save money in the end!"

That s the only thing the I think is weird and also because why it’s not 9 - 11 age appropriate. The other thing I don’t like is that it won’t let me download the game. Overall, I think it’s a great game."

"5253",695108484,"( I am only talking about levels 1,2,18,19,20, and 27 )  So I wish that levels 1 and 2 had the same name and level 2 (slice and ice) was molehill piste but with different ground because, slice and ice doesn’t fit right. Same with 19 and 20. I wish level 20 looked like level 19 except with a broken roller coaster crumbling apart at the start of the level, why? Because they don’t look the same. Finally level 27, which is the final level, should be an official level. Level 18 should be less weird so those young people out there won’t get any nightmares after playing the game a little bit."

"5262",696565994,"This is a good game, but my problem is that I spent 2.99 to buy 100 gems to buy a weapon, thing is that after you level up and have to upgrade the weapon, you can’t use coins, you have to use gems to upgrade again. So basically I spent 2.99 for a weapon that I could only use for one level, and that I’m being forced to buy more if I want to keep using it, and that just feels like a rip off. This should be fixed by being able to use coins to upgrade like every other weapon in the game after you spend REAL money for it, or give a warning that you’ll have to spend more money to keep using it."

"5280",699687299,"Good value for the price. Got several days worth out of it."
"5281",700227648,"A very good game (even though I’m terrible at it 😋)  I recently starting playing sunrise mode and it is very nice, but I do have one suggestion. Making the sound you get when crashing something less jarring, it is very intense after the calm music of the game-mode. Changing the death music as well would be nice. Maybe the sound of magi a wind chimes to represent the sparks or something like that for the death sound could be nice, and the post-death music could possibly just be the same soundtrack that plays when you are flying in that world. This would make the experience more calming without the jolt of a crash sound to interrupt the zen."

(won't mention any names... but you all know what I'm talking about) are over qualifying and do not show the student's progress.  This app will let you adjust norms to fit your populations is very helpful with demonstrating progress. You will be impressed at the ease of administration. And...For the price, you can't beat it."
"5286",700440156,"I am enjoying this app quite a bit. I like the automatic notation of phonological processes, and I love the option of choosing the norms that you want to follow. It has become my preferred articulation assessment tool.  I do have a couple of issues, though.  One, it only sometimes emails the results when I instruct it to do so. Sometimes it emails several days later. The other issue is with the assessment report. I certainly don’t turn in the report, but I do print it and use it for my records. It is very long with lots of wasted space on the report. Please refer to the report on the Articulation Assessment Toolkit. That report is very well organized and it is much easier to read than the report generated by this app. It looks professional as well, for the folks who may choose to submit it."

You get plenty of money of the levels, but hardly any books to level-up your troops, or stars for weapons. It’s now just a grind to get the “scrap” rewards to move forwards."

"5295",700653178,"I wanted to like this game, I really did. Its fun when you first start but very a quickly you progress to a point where the game gets difficult. I mean after maybe a few hours of playing. This is a pay to win game. You can recruit new troops, but any good ones can't be bought with currency that is more abundant, no they cost 1k+ of the special in game currancy that you need to buy. Oh yeah, you can try to grind and save but did I mention the pay wall you hit after a few hours? Don't waste your time with this. I'm so tired of greedy developers. I understand you have to make a living but this is just terrible."

"5322",708142626,"i used to enjoy playing this game when i was younger, so I decided to get the game in game. But when I try to play, the screen is so far titled to one side and it makes it quite impossible to steer. I’ve tried to recalibrate the tilt in the settings but nothing seems to work. Please fix this glitch and the game will be so much better."
"5323",708196645,"I think the bad things about this game is that the controls stink, there is a lot of backtracking, and the game is way to short. Other than that, the bosses, characters, plot lines, and music is amazing! Zelda fans, this is where you should be!"

"5325",708196645,"Game won’t save, game has numerous glitches that the developers seem to ignore, I’m currently a legend but stuck on the island of whispers so I started the game from the beginning and just now I started playing and noticed all of my progress and items are gone again!!! Ok for your kids but that’s about it. Thanks for nothing."
"5326",708379313,"I can’t make a group permanent, it makes me add the speakers individually each time. And the volume buttons on my phone only control one speaker not the entire group so to adjust volume I have to go into the app and drag the slider. Also the volume buttons on my phone only control one speaker rather than the entire group, forcing me to use the slider volume control in the app itself. Very inconvenient. I would not recommend this, there are better systems available especially for the premium price of Bose."
"5327",708379313,"It would be nice to add a sleep timer."
"5328",708379313,"I have 4 SoundTouch 10's and one SoundTouch 300. I love using this app, but at the same time, I experience some frustrations with it. It really could use some fixes and enhancements:  1. When using SoundTouch to access my Deezer account, and referencing My Library, it does NOT alphabetize the list. I have long lists of Artists and Albums. I have to read through the entire list to find what I am looking for, so it takes a while. That's quite inconvenient. The separate Deezer app does alphabetize these same lists; the SoundTouch app just needs to do that, too. 2. When playing an album with the Deezer service, after a while I can no longer user the left arrow to return to the list of songs on the album. I have to go to the artist's page, then find the album again. 3. When selecting a speaker for SoundTouch to use, I would like the ability to rearrange the order of the speakers (I have 5) so that they would be listed in the app in the order I want. One of my preferences would be to place my primary speaker (SoundTouch 30)  as the first one listed, so it is the first one to appear when I go to the speaker panels.  If I can do it this way, I won't have to swipe through the list to reach my primary speaker every time I'm turning it on for switching music. 4. While swiping through the list of speakers, the app often jumps back to the first speaker in the list, fighting my efforts to choose a speaker other than the first one. 5. When playing on multiple synchronized speakers, and I return to the listing of speakers in the group, sometimes the volume slider for one of the speakers appears in the wrong position. When this happens, the slider is positioned much lower than what is the actual setting. 6. I would like to have more presets. An idea I have for implementing this, using current hardware, is to allow pressing two number keys on the speaker. For example, additional presets could be 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 22, etc. I'm assuming this could be accomplished in the software/firmware. 7. I can't find a way to submit product enhancement suggestions and bug reports to Bose. The mechanism may exist, but I can't find it. The Feedback section was updated with more questions, and the ability to enter text comments. However, the text area allows only a few sentences, then cuts off the rest (I tried to paste in 7 issues and suggestions, with explanations for each one.) Most companies have an email address or web page for this. If I could find a means to do that, I wouldn't be posting these problems and suggestions in the App Store review. 8. While playing music using the Deezer service, I was in the Feedback area in the app, and entering the comments. I had to switch to another app to check my notes. When I returned, the feedback page was gone, and I was left with the Deezer page, but with the top of the page missing: no buttons, and no Deezer name. I had to close and reopen the app to fix it. 9. I would like the option to select the music first and then the speakers second. Currently, if I want to play some music through multiple speakers, I have to first select one speaker, then select the music, then go back to the list of speakers and add the additional speakers to the streaming. Therefore, I would like the option to select the music, then select the speaker or speakers. That would be much more convenient. It would be fine to keep the existing method as an alternative."
"5329",708388097,"I absolutely adore and love this game, however, ever since a most recent update (a couple years ago) I have not seen a single other player on the multiplayer... It really upsets me because I always loved working with completely anonymous people that worked with me and despite so little communication we could know whether someone was agreeing, trying to figure out what you mean, or disagreeing and feeling that their way is better.  The teamwork in this game was amazing, but doing everything alone is not only more difficult, but quite boring... I know it's several years after it stopped working but I really, really hope you guys can update and fix it, please!!"
"5330",708388097,"Whoever made this game is genius"

"5335",709003148,"When I first got this app, the majority of the comics that you could read were free, one would pay to get premium if they wanted to read a week ahead of people who didn’t.  AND, all of the completed series were FREE!  Since their most recent update (12/1/2018) they have started to charge for reading the previously completed comics.  At this point, since you would have to pay a monthly to re-read comics, you may as well just buy a Japanese comic book that you can write notes (such as translations) INSIDE the comic and it becomes a really fun textbook.  何故無料だったサービスの為に今は金払わないといけないの？馬鹿じゃね〜の？  このアプリ即消し。"

"5360",714796093,"This is one of two games on my phone that I have happily spent a good bit of money on. The sudden addition of ads is ridiculous. Guess I’ll check back in a few months and see if they’re still there."

"5375",718043190,"In the latest version of Fantastical 2 for iPhone, Version 2.11 (864), when you tap on an Event, the font size for the Title and the Notes shrinks down to half of the original size. (This problem was not present in any previous versions.) I sure hope this is a bug, because I have to squint now, to read the Title and the Notes. When you edit the Event, the font size jumps back to the normal size again, but I shouldn’t have to edit each Event, every time I want to read it. Also, when you go to the Fantastical 2 “Help” section and select “Tips and Tricks,” or “Frequently Asked Questions,” the font size for all of that information is even SMALLER that the size I mentioned above. I have been using Fantastical for years. It has been my favorite app. I hope this isn’t supposed to be a “feature,” because it ruined the app for me.  I looked in the “Settings” for Fantastical 2, thinking that perhaps there was a new user-selectable setting for the font size, but there was not. I’m sure that this must be a result of Flexibits adding support for Apple’s system-wide fonts in iOS, but it has been implemented poorly. I hope someone will fix this issue. I don’t wear glasses, or have vision problems, but this new problem makes the app really hard to read and use."
"5376",718043190,"It keeps my life in order. I have been been using it for a couple of years and I don’t know why I haven’t reviewed it before. I use icons to make items stand out.

The game is still formatted for an iPhone 4. C’mon Guys,.. you can do better than this. Don’t give up on it, just update it and watch the cashola come pouring in again.

I know I’m not the first person to raise these issues. What the hell is the hold up on addressing these issues? People have been complaining for weeks and there have been several updates and the issues still exist. For a paid app it isn’t worth the money or frustration.

Questions submitted by followers with the wrong answer are voted in, so there’s another question you’ll get wrong, if you answer it right. Lastly, you don’t have a clue who your playing. It may say your playing X and then in your list of games, that player is now J. If you’ve played X in 5 games already it will say neither of you have played before. Do you need more examples? I deleted this app."

"5426",724295527,"The app is easy to use and has lots of fun stuff"
"5427",724295527,"My only complaint is I wish video recording didn’t have a limit. I don’t see why there needs to be a cap but it’s still fun to play with"

"5429",724786142,"This game promotes exploration and learning through several mini-games. Games such as matching, color and shape associa7on to name a few. This game can provide hours of fun."

"5439",725208930,"The app is great, love the flexibility.   Was hoping that we could link Instagram to the profile. That would be more helpful since everything on Instagram is more visual just like on Wear!  Thank you!"
"5440",725222008,"I had the game for 5 months. Now ( March, 13,2019 ) I cannot get on! I’m 37% percent deleted this app. It’s 99% (NOTE: NOT 100(HUNDRED-)PERCENT) End of NOTE I’m only 10!

"5443",725222149,"...then just...blah. There are some things that are annoying as hell—like trying to complete a mission only to have the entire battalion wiped out and then there you are in the slowest moving and slowest loading tank against four or five faster moving and faster loading tanks. Lame."
"5444",725222149,"Developers will not update or fix bugs.  The game is riddled with cheaters who have hacked the game.  Cheaters shoot through walls, rocks, hills, and mountains.  Cheaters have unlimited special ammo.  Cheaters have increased their tank speeds so they move like race cars.  Cheaters have altered their internet connection so they lag in the game making it impossible to shoot them.  Don’t waste your time or money."
"5445",725222149,"I really like it, just need some fixes. And update the app for my newest iPad Pro 11 inches , doesn’t run well on the screen. But the games is amazing"
"5446",725440538,"This is it app is the best app ever I love how it counts down to Christmas from the Day Christmas comes this is really a lovely app I gave it five stars"
"5447",725440538,"This is the perfect app for a year round count down. On my iPhone I have it as a widget so I only need to swipe once for a quick peak to check what the countdown is at. I also love opening it and reading the Christmas quote for a bit of cheer throughout the year."
"5448",725440538,"I’ll say this app is great love the quotes and the festive style on this ads should not be on here but anyway I’m using this again this year beautiful job developers"
"5449",726147252,"I love Sunday lawn. I haven’t played it for 5 YEARS! And now I’m a fan again! You should definitely download this if your looking for a Classic game. I hope Sunday lawn’s company/maker makes more games in the future. Five star ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Review."

"5452",727109676,"Cheer cards seem like a student’s CompSci101 project. Tracking is okay. Timers are way off (2 hours into the NYC Marathon, it shows 10 hours have elapsed). Meh."
"5453",727109676,"The cheer cards crash about ever third click. Feels like it was made the night before over beers"
"5454",727109676,"Can’t send a cheer card because the app keeps freezing. Such a disappointment"
"5455",727296976,"I’ve been playing this game for a long time.  All of a sudden, it’s all changed.  Now that you can get extras for watching ads, you can’t hardly beat a level without watching the ads or buying boosters. Candy crush is the same way.  I guess I need to find something else to do when I need a few minutes of me time."
"5456",727296976,"I am now repeating the game.   Is this over????"
"5457",727296976,"Constant glitches have to close game and start again...."
"5458",727420266,"Hi I'm 12 and love this game. Though I think the stories need to have the price taken off. It will definitely make the game more fun. I don't want to uninstall it so I keep playing the same thing over and over again. But it's getting boring. Pleasseeee take off the price for aleast a couple stories. Then you'll get five stars. Other than that.... BEST GAME EVER!!!!😻😻"
"5459",727420266,"👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"5460",727420266,"This app doesn’t support iPhone X or above. Don’t bother purchasing. Until they update the app, this is completely useless for newer iPhone users."
"5461",727466621,"I want an update so that I can play as Orochi. He’s been my favorite boss character. I’d love to just mop the floor with the competition with him."
"5462",727466621,"When I played this game and make the difficulty level 1 and when I defeat 2 stage of fighter on to stage 3 the difficulty increase? And I can’t win it because I’m trash as hell so uhhh fix or decrease difficulty for all wave if your difficulty level is on 1"
"5463",727466621,"First off I used to play this game a lot back then when I used to go to arcades, it was so fun to play and beat it so many times, I also was able to play Orochi, I can’t play Orochi in this one nor I can’t input a cheat to unlock him, plz make him playable game is not complete with orochi it’s such a downer when you can’t play him at all. Also add a training mode like the 2012 version"
"5464",728293409,"It is a really good “smart” game which activates your neurons. Too bad it is so short, I have finished it in a couple of hours."
"5465",728293409,"good ieoeoe"
"5466",728293409,"Playing this game is like solving a Zen Koan while on Mushrooms. It may help you remember the path you took to get here, or the pathway home. Brilliant Craftsmanship and Design."
"5467",729686081,"My son and nieces love this book and the animation. I recommend to download this app!!!!"
"5468",729686081,"Disappointment and frustrating- this app also had no audio!"
"5469",729686081,"I love it,I just love it because it's an adventure for me I just love it...It needs more books!!😋😋😋"
"5470",730091131,"Good app, but the latest update won’t download. It just says: “this item is no longer available.”"
"5471",730091131,"This app does exactly what I want it to do. It isn’t perfect but it’s very close. It never crashed for me on my iPhone 6 or iPhone X. Exporting the video was never a problem. The editor part can be a little taxing at times, but that’s ok because I minimal editing here. I just make my green screen scenes here and edit with iMovie. If people have a problem with green fringes, it can help to work on your lighting. Have some side/fill lights on the subject to drown out any green that might be there."
"5472",730091131,"Even with this 2019 update (which is a great improvement) I’ve notice some serious crashing with less than a 100 frames now. Use to get more frames than that before it crashed before; so I have to start a new project (to be safe) after 50+ frames or so. Very annoying for a great product.  PLEASE FIX (w/o erasing everything like that last 3 updates or so)."
"5473",730148796,"Best. App. Ever. Developer responded promptly when we had a few initial set up questions. We set it up effortlessly with both interior and exterior lights and two light strips. Connected a stereo outside on Halloween night. Our house was the scariest in the neighborhood by far! Loved the extra package with additional noises, it was worth the extra $. Thank you for a great app and great communication!"
"5474",730148796,"The audio does not work after the last few updates. I tested on and IPad and I phone X.  Very disappointing as part of the effect is the audio."
"5475",730148796,"This app is rather lame. For starters, i recognize some of these sounds from YouTube, so not all that original. Second, you can’t make any of these loop indefinitely. I was hoping there was a heart beat mode, and there is, but the color isn’t just red, it changes with each beat. Who wants that?  In general, these Hue apps fall far short of actually being cool. The light sequences aren’t all that coordinated and there nothing here you can actually use for anything more than novelty."
"5476",730712409,"I use this mostly taking macro photos of bugs and plants. Close ups of many different items. This is by far the best macro camera in the App Store. IMHO!"
"5477",730712409,"ProCam provides a multitude of options which suit almost every situation. I have tried many iPhone photography apps and Procam is the one which works best for me. Couple that with long-term support and meaningful updates and it’s a no brainer."
"5478",730712409,"This is bug and I have reported it, this is a paid app and they need to fix it. I will change my rating once the bug has been corrected. Not happy at all!  Side note: it doesn’t save your shutter speed or ISO settings switching to video mode requires you to reset those two controls."
"5479",730873197,"I can’t make my hair long in the game."
"5480",730873197,"My daughter has autism and will not let us cut her hair.  It’s so long that she can almost sit on it so I’ve been buying and trying tons of apps to try getting her more comfortable with the idea of a haircut.  I was really excited about this app when I first saw it because my daughter could actually put her own face on there.  I’m not so happy about it now because the growing serum or whatever it’s called only lets you get the hair shoulder-length.  Her hair is super long so I’m afraid it’ll freak her out seeing herself with such short hair.    Secondly, the styling tools and accessories are all geared towards boys.  There’s no brush, styling tools, or accessories/extras that are remotely girly.  There’s only a mustache, fake nose, bow tie, and a blue pin.    The last update was a year ago so clearly this app isn’t really a priority to the developer anymore.  PLEASE update the app to include girls too!!"
"5481",730873197,"I want a refund doesn’t work at all"
"5482",730878935,"Add more people and unlock more of them give us more fun.💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩"
"5483",730878935,"Theirs to many ads and i waited a long time to download 😔"
"5484",730878935,"Great game no but my kid ❤️ this game"
"5485",730919094,"Well, I love this game. It takes me back when I use to go to the arcades.lol I miss those days. The music, the controls etc everything is wonderful so I give it a 10 out of 10. I something else you can also play with your friends online so is awesomeeee love it   It’s 2 players. Who wants to team up lol"
"5486",730919094,"Brings back memories thank you for the port developers, please keep updating for latest devices"
"5487",730919094,"fun to play but you cant add credits and the continue option isnt always there."
"5488",731041554,"The fish drinks a coconut and throws the straw in the ocean. That’s some great eco friendly education right there! :("
"5489",731041554,"The concept of the game is to basically move your finger around the screen to make the fish swim. It's so simple to use that even the youngest iPad fan will be entertained. The fish explores a variety of fun, colorful scenes. It has saved us from many public outburst from a bored toddler. The only downfall is that the game is very short lived, so for an older child, they'll likely lose interest after 10-15 minutes. Recommend this for ages 1-4."
"5490",731041554,"This is an excellent app. It is a must have, once you figure out how to control the fish and lead him to the fun antics you will love it! Very cute. Good job!"
"5491",731592936,"Constant technical issues"
"5492",731592936,"I’ve had this app for a few years now and really loved playing it. But recently it wouldn’t add my rewards to my characters. I notified the app team and they said they didn’t see anything wrong with my account. I told them I would no longer be playing because it would be a waste of time since I couldn’t upgrade characters. I asked for a refund of my $9.99 for the chest I had just purchased and they refused."
"5493",731592936,"OK HERES THE DEAL WITH THE CHESTS  THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND FOR ME THEY TAKE SO LONG TO GET 60 GEMS. AND WHAT DID I GET IN THE NIGHT MARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS CHEST.............. A DUMB ATTRACTION . A ATTRACTION IS NOT WHAT THE PEOPLE WHAT DISNEY.  WE BUY THE CHESTS TO GET A CHARACTER NOT LIKE A ATTRACTION. WHEN I GOT THE ATTRACTION I SAID THIS WAS A WAST OF GEMS AND TIME. THE OVER ALL CONCLUSION IS THAT REDUCE THE PRICE ON A CHEST AND GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!!!!!!!!!! AND PLEASE HAVE THEY PEOPLE WHP GO TO SCHOOL ( like me) GET MORE TIME ON THE CHALLENGES THANK YOU 😤😤"
"5494",731629156,"I have this app so when I’m away from home I can watch channels I wouldn’t get else where. But 95% of the time I always get that message “due to license agreement you must be connect to your in home WiFi”..... If I’m home I’m not using the app I’m using my actual tv. I pay for my cable so I should be able to watch my cable via the app where ever I want to. I travel a lot and figured wow this app will be nice to have but it’s been more disappointing.... Get it figured out Xfinity and quit your corporate greed, it’ll be okay to let people who pay for their cable to watch it where ever they want. 😑"
"5495",731629156,"title is pretty self explanatory. unless you’re at home on your “personal xfinity wifi” this app is pretty useless. completely defeats the purpose, why stream something i can already watch on tv.....don’t think these people get it."
"5496",731629156,"Cant watch anything or recorded.  What happened"
"5497",731645633,"App crashes immediately after opening. The support button does not work."
"5498",731645633,"The game itself is great, but I was prompted to rate this game in-app despite the fact that I have in-app ratings disabled. Also, it hasn’t been updated to support 2018’s iPad Pros"
"5499",731645633,"If you’re a fan of checkers/chess and Hitman franchise I think you’ll really enjoy this game. Even better, get “Go” and sniper DLC is included."
"5500",733989611,"This is exactly what I need, except that there’s poor support for short timelines (24 hrs or less). You can’t set a timeline to last less than a year, which is really a shame because even at full zoom, you just can’t distinguish between events at different times on the same day. I’d love to set it for any arbitrary length of time."
"5501",733989611,"I’ve use this app to create a timeline to evaluate the facts of a lawsuit  I am handling. It has been very helpful in getting a better understanding of the events as they occurred."
"5502",733989611,"Very effective visual communication app."
"5503",734256893,"It’s really amazing. Showroom connects us with our idols. We don’t need to understand Japanese. I love this app because I can meet my oshi through this app. AKB, NMB, HKT and other idol groups used it. Awesome!!! Let’s meet our oshi through it."
"5504",734256893,"I love showroom! I can see my idol go livestream (AKB48,HTK48,NMB48) 😍"
"5505",734256893,"iPhone8で全然音声がないです。星投げる時の音もないです。"

"5509",735128536,"Love this game. It's one of the few I do not offload. So, the game's very relaxing but requires precision. I couldn't have imagine putting those adjectives in the same sentence prior to playing GoL. It starts out easy but definitely becomes more challenging as one moves through the levels. There are four of five chapters with 25 levels. Even though I wish there were more ""chapters"" (I don't know what to call them), there's a lot to do. I've played through a few times, coming back to it every few months. It is still challenging at the upper levels. My only complaint is the weird Firefly hint deal which is not a component to enjoying the game. Buy it & encourage creativity.  Makers: Hint button. Meh. I used up all of my little bugs in one try because I didn't figure the workings of fast enough. Of course, if this is your intention, cool, I'll just think faster!"
"5510",735128536,"Can’t believe such an amazing game and the developers forgot about it, 2 years without an update, no new levels, no nothing... this is one of those games I really enjoyed playing, passed it I a couple of hours 2 years ago and I’m still wanting more from it. You have it guys, please, is it possible to have more levels to play ?"
"5511",735128536,"Please update this amazing game! This is an amazing game but needs to be updated to fit XS Max screen!"
"5512",735434007,"My daughter loves Super Why, great app!"
"5513",735434007,"Rip off. Can't download, no customer support listed."
"5514",735434007,"I have already paid for the app and it throws an error message almost immediately, freezing. First, I got it by clicking ""play"" then the back arrow, and then after I force quit and tried again, it happened another time when I visited the parent info section and then exited that. I bought this for my daughter to play with on a road trip tomorrow morning... so much for that."
"5515",735752897,"Objectives  fixed bug"
"5516",735752897,"No blood and no voice, I paid money for this! Fix this!!!"
"5517",735752897,"This game is almost unplayable... the characters body freaks out and the layers on the map get mixed up from front to back... Please fix the glitches and bugs!!!  I also payed $1 for this game and it doesn’t have any blood or gore! : ("
"5518",735945527,"No M M N L K K K K K L"
"5519",735945527,"So I love this game and I loved it for a long time Om Nom is SOOOOO cute and it got even better when I started unlocking things that cost money randomly for free! For example, no ads! For like a month or so I had ZERO ADS! But that all changed when I connected to school WiFi (this iPad is new) and first thing when playing a pop-up appeared. I hoped it was just a glitch that got through but no, it kept on appearing. Then I was hoping that it was just a new ad they added, but then ones I had gotten over a month ago started appearing. I was so angry! My last hope is that it was only on school WiFi but when I got home... AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD! So I am SUPER ANGRY at ZeptoLab UK Limited and if you’re a developer please respond to this! But overall four stars a pretty good game just drowned by ads. Thank you for reading my super long review and hope you have that super of a day thank you!  Update: It turns out I am realizing what the problem is (probably). I don’t need your help anymore but will tell you how to remove ads! If this doesn’t work then I am wrong and I am not 100% sure this will work, but if you go to settings>screen time>content restrictions>web content or something like that>allowed websites only and you go to cut the rope it should work with no ads! Hooray! No more ads! But when surfing the web you will have to turn it off or allow the websites you want to visit. But it will still by a 99% chance work! Have a good day. Edit: Also, you can’t watch videos with that setting."
"5520",735945527,"The Best."
"5521",736179781,"The messages always show the message of things are quiet. Never showing my messages, other than that it’s great. Just have to view my messages on the ol Xbone"
"5522",736179781,"Always without a doubt this app is bad. Every time I open it, replaying a clip Grey bar at the top of the screen no scrubbing at all or done to exit. If I press where these things should be it works. Sending messages, sometimes keyboard covers text field as well as messages just don’t send. After about 3 or 4 try agains it works for some reason. Searching things works similarly, searching a gamertag for example the same gamertag takes a few searches to pop up. I’ve tried deleting and re-downloading multiple times to no avail. At this rate for me the app has more negatives than positive so much so I wrote a review. Simply put it needs way more bug fixes."
"5523",736179781,"Can you please allow me to use the app in both portrait and landscape, it’s very annoying to have to constantly orient my iPad differently for this specific app."
"5524",736683061,"I’ve come back to this game to play more times than I can count. I’ve never actually finished the game until this day, and I can confidently say that it will always be one of my favorites to play. The story makes you figure itself out with all of its mystery and the emotion involved in such a simply built game is so strong. I love it."
"5525",736683061,"Very unique.  It consumed me completely."
"5526",736683061,"The game is amazing I’m just making a review in hopes that it will be updated to fit the newer models of iPhone, on the XS the notch blocks location / top of the screen. Should be relatively easy to fix since The Ensign, which is my favorite mobile game, works perfectly fine with a smaller resolution and fits on any device."
"5527",736741821,"I love that I can just start somewhere, anywhere. The first timer is 5 minutes so I pick something small and feel accomplished right away. Then I just keep choosing other small chunks and take the built in break times.  The reason for taking away 1 Star is because an audible feature when the break or work time is up would take it to the next level."
"5528",736741821,"This app is sooo good. Take it from me. If your like me and get really scared to do something that takes awhile, you should download this app, it splits it up from 5 min to another 20 and keeps going and you can chose to take a break. I was cleaning my room for like an hour and I thought it was just like 30 min it’s amazing. Did I mention that you could pick a reward! Just download this app"
"5529",736741821,"Found it very effective and helpful so far.  Nothing you don’t need, everything you do... except the ability to set reminders for specific days, not just same time every day. Mainly just need it for weekends.  With this, I’d give it 5 stars."
"5530",737006024,"I don’t like this game I mean I do but you should’ve added Thanos to the game and because I don’t want To collect gold bricks to unlock the next level is because it’s aggravating and hard so please update this game."
"5531",737006024,"It’s so fun"
"5532",737006024,"We need more characters I was excited cause when I got it back I was hoping for more updates cause I haves played for 2 years and when there is a timer for golden bricks I never find any plz change this I’m begging you plz plz do it"

"5536",738201550,"I absolutely love fandango now and will continue to buy movies and TV shows. My only concern is I have a TV at work that is mine and I cannot seem to get a FandangoNow to play any of my purchased movies/TV shows."
"5537",738201550,"Can’t purchase in app, can’t categorize purchases, app is not user friendly. Take the user criticism and better it. This app could have so much potential."
"5538",738201550,"This app and the entire service is poorly run, but also completely useless, until there is an Apple TV app."
"5539",738717933,"Nothing else needs to be said...."
"5540",738717933,"Ok so the thing that irritates me is that it takes forever to drive around in a tractor to go pick up supplies at the shop. It would be nice if we could have a pickup truck if we wanted one for faster transportation.  The camera view doesn’t go that far out either so it’s hard to tell which way you’re going unless you look at the map constantly. You also can’t set way points down unless it’s part of a mission you’re following.   Also the planting of the seeds takes forever through the stages. It would be nice if it could be a little faster. Or if not that. Then it would grow while you’re offline or something. And then when you come back it’ll be ready.   It’s also hard to make good money when the seed growing process takes to long."
"5541",738717933,"I love this game"
"5542",738897668,"Please don’t take away the video option it makes a big difference with putting together the perfect slide show!!! I love this app it’s been my favorite since day 1:)"
"5543",738897668,"Well, I live in Palestine and I have many problems with every payment process on internet that I can’t deal with and most of apps need money to edit videos, then my friend told me about VivaVideo and I downloaded it and spent almost 4 hours making my first video ever and I got really happy that I actually made something! But, tadaaa!!! VivaVideo refused to save or share the video I made before paying money, by demanding another payment thing! And a “vip”.. ughhh what about my wasted time I spent making a video for my friend’s birthday?! I’m really disappointed with what happened and my efforts I gave for nothing at the end!"

"5545",739234325,"2016: So fun I love it! Play it all the time. Great sound bites from the characters and all the upgrades keep it interesting. Yay Beemo! That said it often crashes at the end of a ski run. After the skip timer and before it shells out the dosh. Coins and any precious chests all gone... never to return. Sigh. Yet I keep taking the risk cuz I want that Zombie Finn. Those chests are rare. Please fix? This game totes deserves 5 stars.  2019 Update: With the new update all my progress and purchases are gone. Also there seems to be no “restore purchases” button anywhere. Seems I’m not the only one experiencing this.."
"5546",739234325,"This game is really fun! It doesn’t take much effort in order to play. However there are some bugs still. I don’t know if other players get this issue but for my IPhone XR, the music and sound effects are playing from the phone call ear piece rather than the speakers. It’s kinda annoying because I like the music and sound effects and I can barely hear them through then ear piece. Please fix 🙏 everything else is perfect but that!"

"5548",739836039,"Couldn’t find any of the books I tried in their database. Tried scanning the OSBN, manually entering, searching by title. Nothing worked. What a rip off!!!!!"
"5549",739836039,"I use this to identify books in our collection or at the library that are the right level for my daughter to practice reading. It’s very easy to use, especially with the barcode scanning feature. There are generally books that I can’t find, and I wish there was a way to submit those for review and have the reading level get added to them. If they’re not in the database I can’t even add them to my library (within the app). It’s nice that there is a decoder page to match up the various reading level scales, since not all books are rated on all the scales. Overall this app is still very helpful even with the drawbacks listed."
"5550",739836039,"After 20 years I came back to Kinder. Instead of DEAR time there is Independent Reading as a part of a BLP. Both those and take home books need to be leveled to “Guided Readings” GR or F&P or back in the day Reading Recovery. I went online to A-Z database to type in my library books and few were found. I printed lists of books - tedious. After 15 min I now have 50% of my library scanned with this app! 90% were in this database and about 80% had a leveled score. About 50 of Joy Cowleys books are leveled. Thank you makers!!"

"5560",741292507,"Just updated the app and found lots of things really annoying. You have to watch ad when you open it every time. For videos, if you want to see the comments there is no place to stop the video and so you have to hear the video play again and again.   So regret for the update. Want the old version back"

"5563",741293420,"I can’t insert photo in some pdf file. Whenever I insert a photo from camera roll, the app crash."
"5564",741293420,"They stopped asking for more money so I moved it up to 3 stars.   I have been using this app for a long time and paid for it in the beginning. Below, you can read my original glowing review.  However, the developers have done virtually nothing since then to improve the app and I have found it to be very unstable, frequently crashing and losing my annotations.  I was happy to see an update pop up for it a few days ago, however instead of improving it this update just makes the app harass me to pay for a subscription to use their new updated version of the app.  This is ridiculous, especially since I already paid for this app!  If you want split screen in a PDF reader, get easy annotate.  For other stuff, go with any app that doesn't crash constantly and doesn't try to get more money from you after you already paid for their product.  If they want to switch to a subscription model, fine, but give a free subscription to the people who bought your app when you were just getting started.  If you won't do that, you have no integrity and deserve to crash and burn!  I have been using the free version of this app which is a reader only for quite a while because it is by far the fastest I have seen.  Meanwhile I have hunted everywhere for split screen PDF apps.  I have side by side which is nice but can't annotate.  I have Easy Annotate which has great potential but which I find slow and temperamental as well as having issues with annotating text in languages that put some characters above and below others.  Recently I learned that this app had added a spit screen view.  I decided to get it and am very impressed.  As a PDF viewer, annotating app, this is the best I have used.  The highlight tool works great in any language I have tried.  Split screen is excellent and easy to use.  File management is functional and easy to navigate.  This is not a media player, browser, Swiss Army knife but it is a great pdf app.  Why only 4 stars then?  There are a few minor things that could be improved.   1. Simplify the highlighter color selection.  I don't need a million color choices.  I do need about 5 good distinct colors that can be easily changed.  The implementation is not terrible, but would be much better if everything but a simple selection of preferred colors was under a secondary menu. 2. Any time you are annotating, the undo, redo buttons should be visible.  Right now, they are often not. 3. The file outline and bookmarks need to be accessible in split screen mode. 4. The underline feature looks excellent, however it is not in the same menu as the highlight option or as easy to use.  It would be really nice if those two options and their color selections were together and if you could underline as easily as you can highlight. Thanks for a great app.  I will be recommending it to many people and will love it even more if you can implement these suggestions."
"5565",741293420,"Is they go under financially, quit, die, or whatever then you can't use he app?"
"5566",741597322,"It is an amazing app"
"5567",741597322,"Really need it"
"5568",741597322,"This tiny app is simple to manage many passwords.  It is very easy to use and support Touch ID. Passwords are saved local location, no need to send to remote server. Great!"
"5569",742625884,"If you’re like me, spacial awareness is your dump stat and this game will be super challenging. But that’s why I like it! It’s so satisfying to clear a challenge. Sometimes I open the app just to play with the physics and sound effects.   It can be a tad frustrating when I’m not in the right mood but mostly it’s a great brain teaser   I highly recommend giving it a go"
"5570",742625884,"When ever I click share -> save image the game crashes. iPhone XS on 12.1.3, intel, Verizon I’d be happy to give info to fix this. Beautiful game and and sounds though"
"5571",742625884,"No fun in higher levels. The line seems to change direction on its own when near black dots or near colored circles. Frustrating when game play is not connected to your input. It seems skill in launching the line does not help at level 28. It just got boring, uninstalled."
"5572",743974925,"Text jumps if I bump it. The side-touch to turn a page was so much better."
"5573",743974925,"What is going on?! Nothing works anymore. Scaling is off. Now just keeps shutting down. Why do y’all keep releasing updates that don’t fix anything? Taking shots in the dark?"
"5574",743974925,"I purchased PDF Expert: PDF Editor in January, 2018 for $9.99 and have the iTunes purchase receipt.  I used the package occasionally to edit or redact PDFs, and it worked very well.   About a month ago, I opened the package and it wouldn’t work. When I tried to edit or redact, it offered me a “free trial” teaser leading to a $50/year subscription.   I tried “restore purchases” which didn’t work, then contacted Readdle. We’ve been back and forth on this for 3 weeks, but their final message on the topic appears to be “Screw you.”  It is unimaginable to me that a company would “upgrade” a software package (named PDF EDITOR), removing its core capability, and try to get me to pay an outrageous upcharge to restore the functionality that I ALREADY PAID FOR. This is the most customer-hostile money grab that I’ve seen in a long time. While I really liked the software, I now hate this company, I’ll never buy anything from them again and I’ll do everything I can to discourage anyone else from doing so."
"5575",744189889,"Great app, so far it is very accurate."
"5576",744189889,"I usually don't write reviews, but this app is absolutely fantastic! So much functionality, a wealth of information and very intuitive to use."
"5577",744189889,"This app is really nicely put together. It is nice looking, has lots of ski resorts in Europe, and has accurate weather predictions. However, in the ""weather"" section, you can only see the weather for Austria. Still, you can see accurate weather predictions of each resort, but for the price, they should fix this. Also, some titles are in German even if you have the app in English."
"5578",744851208,"If you do your research and scour the internet (or the App Store Page) for reviews on this game, you’ll see that most of the reviews label the game as hard. That’s a complete lie. This game isn’t hard... it’s slow.  None of the Kairosoft games are hard. You can’t “lose” in these games. You just earn far less than you spend in this one. Structures cost upwards of a hundred dollars and you only earn 100 or 200 IF you win a race... and sometimes you won’t.   The given allowance is spent quickly on new horses and training structures. It’s not reliable unless you’re content with saving a lot (of money).  Maintenance costs about 100+ early game and it’s a constant cycle, so if you don’t win at least once before the next cycle, you’ll be in the negatives. In addition, items cost upwards of 100 as well. Prices rise the more items you buy.  And of course there’s the obvious concern: horse lifespans. A horse is done by year four. Their stats decrease so they’ll lose the race — and if you don’t make first place, you get less than $100. Races can’t be scheduled rapidly either. So you don’t get paid rapidly — only in $100 chunks once per month.  People coming to your ranch spend about $10-20 and only come when you’ve won — if you lose your streak, you lose your only source of constant income.  Selling a horse gives you about $1000. But then you spend that $1000 on another horse.  Therefore, in order to progress, you must manage your funds carefully— meaning months or even years without spending anything on any major progression. The secondary currency, coins, can’t be spent often since you have to discover an upgrade before buying it.  Races are fun but become mediocre after hours of them. Even when you win. Since horses are temporary and you don’t unlock breeding until late game, you have to level up your horse faster than the previous one or you’ll just be stuck. You’ll have hit a wall.  The three stars I rate here are basically fueled by my love of horses and the sales price of $0.99, which were barely enough to keep me interested. No wonder the $0.99 sale has stayed past December (winter sales). I was drawn in by that sale. But don’t be fooled — unless you like progressing at a crawl or you love horses enough to be okay with many, many races before you progress."
"5579",744851208,"I love Kairosoft, and have maybe eight of their other games, and this one doesn’t really even compare to the others it’s so bad. It’s extremely simplistic and moves very slowly, after a few hours I’m ready to give up on it. Seriously it’s like they gave this project to an intern to manage."
"5580",744851208,"By far, the best horse racing game out there. Been playing for years, and I keep coming back to it! Great game!"
"5581",744882019,"Super app to use for math. Graphics far outperform TI's pixelated offering. Support second to none. Recommended to all of my college math students."
"5582",744882019,"Using this for Intermediate Algebra.  Makes graphing and computing such a snap, and does it in style.  I have had to ask for a bit of help here and there from the developer to input certain things and the return replies were quick and detailed, often with a pic or two.  Quite helpful for me to get back to work.  And this is all before the new expanded version.  Like it wasn’t magnificent before..."
"5583",744882019,"Ernest you are a saint for making this app. Thx"
"5584",745729888,"I really love this game because it's based on one of my favorite shows and I'm an autistic kid who loves that show because UmiCar is so cute. Unfortunately, that show got cancelled last year in 2015 for unknown reasons, but it was still very popular afterward. If you can get the show to come back with a new fifth season, I will be happy. Plus, I would love it if you make a new iOS game where you actually care for and play with UmiCar. You can ""feed"" him math fuel, caress and tickle him, give him a wash, put him to sleep with a lullaby, and play exciting math minigames with him! Oh, and that's not all; you can even dress him up in cool hats and costumes! Wouldn't that be fun? And one more thing, add coins that help you unlock new toys and costumes for UmiCar. So, what are ya waiting for?! Get to work and do all those things to make me happy!  P.S. Apple has confirmed that iOS 11 will not run 32-bit apps. Because this is a 32-bit app, could you please upgrade it to a 64-bit, adding new cars, decals, and BGM to the game?"
"5585",745729888,"I paid for this and the first thing I see is an ad? Money hungry company."
"5586",745729888,"I LOVE THIS GAME.BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE SOME CARS."
"5587",746894884,"Google has to think something special for this app add new features or functions and let watch some movies 4K format and let the user have more options in the app."

"5593",748048441,"I would’ve considered buying the app for what any other game - either on mobile or on other devices, or even in person - costs.  But I am so turned off by the fact that they want this ASTRONOMICAL amount of money for it.   What the heck is this?!? I’ve never even seen any game, especially a word game, have the audacity to charge that amount.     Give me maybe a $20 App Store gift card along with it & I’d consider.   Why on earth would someone pay that, rather than to get maybe 5-7 full games or apps for that price!?  I’ve seen it all now."
"5594",748048441,"You can play the first set for free, then have to pay $3 for one level or $32 for all the levels. The game is different and fun for a little while. Don’t think it’s worth anything beyond the first set though. Bonza is much better and has lots of free levels."
"5595",748048441,"I really liked this game. However, $32 for the rest of the levels, even with the hints and no ads, is ridiculous! I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."
"5596",748057890,"So idk how they make these games so pointless and fun but I have been playing do over 10 years and I’m still playing them"
"5597",748057890,"This game was not worth 3.99! It only has a few things you can do, it is a repeating process. It’s come to the point where it’s boring and I’ve only had it for 24 hours.  I want my money back!!!!!!"
"5598",748057890,"I like games."
"5599",749046891,"I think that you should have a search bar to make it more functional, I want fall but I can’t search! 😠👎"

"5605",749078962,"This app couldn’t predict the weather if it was looking out the window. It is consistently wrong in its forecasting and even the “current” weather for any location. Don’t pay to upgrade. Try any other app if you want to know the weather!!!"
"5606",749078962,"I have paid and tried all of the weather apps and Weather Live is the best of them all. It tops my former favorite NOAA.  Just one thing...we live in Yuma Arizona which gets an average of three inches of rain a year.

"5613",749113886,"This is unacceptable."
"5614",749118884,"Ads? I understand. But now it just freeze at the starting screen with introductions to new features and cannot be closed. I can only tap on ads or paying to fully upgrade it. Come on people, it’s shameless to launch an app that cannot work and ask for money. Shameless!"
"5615",749118884,"Thank u for telling us all the answer I’m really good at math now!"
"5616",749118884,"Bought the Pro version where it said no ads, yet here we are"

"5618",749124884,"Constant ads, popups, begging me to upgrade. Not a clock, you’re downloading a salesman. I deleted it. After I wrote about all the annoying ads and begging me to upgrade, developer wrote that I could avoid the annoying ads by paying to upgrade 😂 Annoying customers into buying is not a longterm strategy."
"5619",749124884,"The alarms just don’t go off. Your phone needs to be unlocked! DO NOT USE THIS."
"5620",749125114,"I just made a new alarm and when it goes off the flashlight also flashes. I found no way to turn this off."
"5621",749125114,"Nice looking and feels solid.  But if your routine involves time zone changes, this is NOT for you.  I traveled to NYC for a few days and needed it to wake me up early in the morning to catch a flight. It did. Only an hour after.  Turns out, it didn't pick up time zone change after three days and still thought I was in the time zone before the trip. And there was no indication of its internal clock. When I snoozed it after the alarm went off at 4:15, it said it would sound again in 5 min at 4:20. Yet the phone clock is already 5:15.  That's practically garbage for me. Uninstalled immediately since I don't want to accidentally use it again."
"5622",749125114,"Yesterday installed and this morning woke me up very smoothly !"
"5623",749132901,"Don't waste your money if you need split screen. Slide over works, but not split."

"5627",749133301,"This app really is the best yeah there’s a thunderstorm last Night and It really helped"
"5628",749133301,"I have to admit that I am bit of a weather geek. I used to use WU but I wasn’t satisfied anymore for several reasons. When a good friend of mine that works for NOAA told me about this app, I went and downloaded it. Then I figured for a few bucks it was worth paying for the extras. I was wrong!  You would think that NOAA would have the latest and greatest technology and the best accuracy. If they do, they sure don’t put it in this app. I can be watching the storm coming across the Chesapeake Bay and the app shows a 0% chance of rain.   The app is really so bad that I had to add WU back to my phone so I can compare the two . I expect more from this app."
"5629",749133753,"Maybe it’s me or my laptop but I can’t stop the never ending ads from popping up on the bottom of my screen. It’s extremely annoying. I don’t know why NOAA would allow such a thing."
"5630",749133753,"First time using it and 2 minutes in, a pop up add for Home Advisor takes up the entire screen. Give me a chance to figure out the app before you try to sell me something. Not the greatest design."
"5631",749133753,"I randomly downloaded this one day because I wanted to check how the weather was going to be that day. Know I use it everyday. Especially when I’m at work. It’s helps so much because when it starts raining I always check for how long it’s going to be for and it’s so accurate. I love it and I recommend it to anyone who doesn’t have it."
"5632",749969909,"This is crap and is Serato made this app shame on them.  Do not buy it’s a waste of money no way to play remotely there’s no start and stop"
"5633",749969909,"The title of the app says""Remote"" so where is the stop/start button?. Holding down that queue button don't do Jack for me.  I'm not trying to mix with this,, just want to start a queued up song away from the rig.  Get on this please."
"5634",749969909,"I spent $4.99 for this?? Smh!! Why is there no play and pause button?? That makes 0 sense.. Also what good is it to be able to go up and down in the crates if you can’t seen what your doing when your away from the rig.. I really wish I would of seen the comments before I spent the money on it.. I would be a lot happier if it just had them two features over all the effects and loops and all that. All is app needs is the Q points a start and stop/pause button and to see your tracks and crates. But it’s been over like 3 years so I don’t see you all doing anything about it.. smh."
"5635",754105884,"Downloaded on iphonex. Does not work at all. Simply gives an era message that it cant access photos. I don't want it to access photos just the camera. Complete waste of money."

"5644",757843896,"This is perfect for teaching children cursive. I have my kids use it with the Apple Pencil so the skill will transfer over to real life writing with pen and paper, and it does. The instructions are straightforward and simple enough I didn’t have to explain to my five-year-old—she didn’t need my help at all. And the animations are dope. They remind me of those bubble things you buy for your desk for people to play with or old Windows screensavers. They are interactive and oddly satisfying."
"5645",757843896,"This app seems to think cursive letters are just print letters with tails. I completely messes up k, b, x and others, which will TOTALLY CONFUSE YOUR CHILD! App should show all the letters so teachers and adults can know what they are getting into. None of the letters with ascenders even have loops for ascenders. This is not simply a matter of “my version of cursive is different than yours.” This is fundamentally being too lazy to make actual cursive."
"5646",757843896,"This app is very glitchy. It started off okay, and the effects are really nice, but once we got to the letter b it would not allow us to continue tracing the letter. It was like it did not sense the touch halfway through the letter. We tried several other letters and it does the same thing. It is a great concept, if only it would work properly.  We even got the paid version so we’re out $5 for a non-working app."

"5653",760645916,"i wish i could rate this 5 stars because this game is really fun and really addicting but there’s a bug. whenever i (and apparently other people, judging by the reviews) play one round, when it usually goes back to the character map, it only shows the characters. it doesn’t show the option to change characters, collect prizes, or start a new round. i have to completely exit the app and restart it just to play one round. it’s really annoying and honestly making me want to not play the game."

"5704",769737983,"How do I contact you? The game keeps kicking me out of the challenges, and then I either lose coins or ♥️s because I just started the challenge game. Today in the last 15 minutes, it kicked me out four times and I lost 4 ♥️s Because I hadn’t finished the challenge. This has been happening way too many times, and no one ever returns my hearts or the coins that I would’ve won if I hadn’t been kicked out, especially when I know I’m gonna win because my score is much higher than the opponents.

"5707",770177884,"Literally love the game is so addicting and with my fiancée, we compete to see who gets further! By far I’ve got to the level 4 and my score was 9,729. And the top 10 from the day. The #1 was 10,001 and #2 was 9,126. Just want to know why I’m not showing up in there :/ otherwise the game is a 5/5"
"5708",770177884,"UPDATE 6: It’s now October 2017. I reloaded this game onto my iPhone 6S Plus to see if the developer made any improvements with the recent iOS 11 update. Answer: NO! The game still freezes randomly when the blob that you’re manipulating through the maze gets stuck on an obstacle. Already deleted the game from my phone. It’s a shame they never fixed this glaring glitch. But look on the bright side: the pop-up ads still work great!  STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED!   UPDATE 5: It's now September 2016. Yes, the game is still off of my new iPhone 6s Plus. I'm reading more current reviews that have expressed the same frustration I expressed over a year ago with this game. Sad that the developers won't listen to the reviews and make the appropriate improvements to the game. Will check back in another year to see if improvements have been implemented. Out.  UPDATE 4: It's now one year later since my last review, and the game is still deleted off of my iPhone. Looks like more recent reviews are echoing what I stated in my original reviews from a couple years ago. Sad.  UPDATE 3: The game still has glitches where you get hung up on an obstacle and can't get off of it which causes you to lose your life and have to start all over at the beginning. Not sure why the developer will not address this issue. I did see that the developer was pretty quick to install ads and things like that, so I don't know why they won't fix the gameplay bugs. As soon as I finish typing this, I'm deleting the app from my phone. Do not buy and download less you like buggy gameplay that's very frustrating and a lot of ads.   DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED!  UPDATE 2: As others have pointed out, I also have been experiencing bugs in the game where I get hung up on one of the obstacles. When this happens, you cannot move off of the obstacle and you have to wait until the timer runs out and you die. This is very frustrating when you gotten so far in the game and then can't move anymore because you're stuck on an obstacle.  The developer has still not addressed the issue of having to always restart back at the very beginning when you die. This combined with the bugs is making this game very frustrating. I'm on the verge of deleting this game from my iPhone. I'm changing my final analysis to:  NOT RECOMMENDED  UPDATE: This game is still fun to play; however, it is too difficult. I've been playing for the last couple of weeks and still cannot get past the third level. It's very, very frustrating when you die and have to go all way back to the beginning. If this issue is not addressed in an update, I will be deleting this game from my iPhone for good. Not worth the frustration, the aggravation, the waste of time, and the lack of a sense of accomplishment.  This game is very fun to play and very creative. The soundtrack is also enjoyable as are the graphics. I hope the developer continues to develop this game and make it more complex by adding more levels, more obstacles, more power ups, and more overall challenge. Great job so far!  Highly recommended."
"5709",770177884,"Love it! But it hasn't been upd8ed in 2yrs. I had 2 delete it due 2 that annoying pop-up message ""This app/game may slow down your iDevice & may not work in future upd8s."" Hope the developer is not MIA & that said developer will upd8 so it's compatible with iOS11."

"5721",774875399,"This is my favorite game right now. Lots of strategy required, some luck involved, really fun to play due to the often highly non-linear progression of play (a single critical move can have a huge impact on the overall balance of power). I wish there were an undo button to fix errant taps, but otherwise this is just like the (super fun) board game, and relatively quick to play."

"5728",775737172,"This app needs a Product designer with a focus on Customer Experience.   I have been writing a History book packed  dates and headers. This requires only 3 levels of hierarchy and the appropriate spacing between the headers and between the body to create the right visual relationship so that it’s scannable.  However there is just one very large distance for the line height,  between all of the headers. There is no way to adjust the gap height, between headers H1, H2, H3 etc... or body.    It’s always a double return amount of space. I don’t know what you call it in Markup. But I just want the character size to be different, with a simple return to the next line. I don’t need a giant double spaced gap between each header.   If I don’t separate with a double return, then the body gets grouped into the header.  A simple 1 return doesn’t have any effect. In the editor it looks like it’s a new line, but I you go to the publish view all the text runs together as if it’s part of the header. It’s the Same with all the H’s. I managed to make it kind of work with H3 and H4. If I could paste their format into H2 and H3, maybe I could get some use from this.  The other problem is return doesn’t return. It’s really a pin to go through and add a double space to every line. If I don’t then it groups all the text into header. The Only way to get the body back down to body size is the space and double return, and then there are all these giant gaps between every date and location. Which is about every 8-20 lines. Probably no big deal for a developer. But for someone whose trying to write content, not code. It’s a real pain.  The other problem, is the *preview button* keeps going away and there is no way to pull it up except poke around on the top of the screen. So every time I want to check if it’s formatted correctly I have to tap around to try to find the hidden button. Of coarse then my curser has selected some other line of text and things start popping off, and then the whole page starts scrolling to the top loosing my place.  This really ruins the experience for me, because now, when the button finally appears, I’m buried somewhere in the middle of 18,000 -30,000 words. Trying to find my way back is a real pain =(. It makes it impossible to concentrate on what I’m actually trying to do, >write.    The #1 goal I have is to write and markup my sections so the dates and titles are easily scannable. I didn’t buy the software so I could “play” with the cool apps features.   I know how difficult it is build an app. But I feel like the Users goals are left out the build process here and instead all the energy went into engineering and implementing  “features for developers”.  I guess it’s not for long form writers. I don’t know what I can use to format this project. I feel like email or notes works the best, but they just can’t handle that much text.  I give 3 stars just because there is so much potential in this app and I really hope they can hire some UX help to figure out what writers want to do (not just devs). And there is a lot of thoughtfulness in it, so I’m hopeful basic formatting will improve.  But for me it’s currently not even as useful as the notes app. Which breaks my heart. Because I know how hard it is to build something like this."
"5729",775737172,"Love this app and use it everyday, from publishing to WP to journaling, jotting down random thoughts to compiling lists (I need to stop neglecting Things 3).  One very minor complaint / question about the interface: is it just me or is the cursor not blue as is being advertised in pictures and in writing? Obviously this isn’t a dealbreaker or anything, but was kinda let down to see it was just the usual, boring grey. Oh well!"

Because this allows me to turn off pinyin unlike other apps it’s forcing me to actually learn the characters! I also like how there’s exp and achievements so that it makes it seem like a game"

PDF files and Word files load readily without any cumbersome conversions.  The interface is well defined and file management is a breeze.  Annotating texts works intuitively and searching is a snap.  Getting started is quick and easy and once the user becomes familiar with basic functionality, it may be the only reader worth using."

"5757",778437357,"We purchased tickets but ended up not receiving the tickets due to our inbox being full. We called to ask our tickets be resent, but the representative said they were unable to resend tickets, and we could request a refund instead. So we submitted the refund request and proceeded to purchase a second set of tickets (because we still needed to make the trip). A week later, we receive notice that the company cannot issue a refund because our inbox being full was not their problem. So essentially, they could neither issue a refund nor resend our tickets? What kind of company fails to keep a log of tickets issued? Imagine your airline or train telling you, “Didn’t get your tickets? Not our problem! We can’t resend your tickets OR give you a refund, sorry!” What a disgrace to customer service. If you need to purchase tickets, get them from another company—one that can resend your tickets if you lost or didn’t get them for whatever reason!!"
"5758",778658393,"This app is okay—not as good as OneNote, but okay.  However, the company is hoodwinking people who buy version 4, thinking it was top of the line, only to be offered version 5 to “complete” their app.  It cost another $8.

Great work out. Balanced and worked lots of different muscles, core, arms, shoulders, legs, hips, balance. I worked up a good sweat in 7 minutes. Cool down helps. The second time will be easier because I’ll know the moves, props, get more reps. You need a chair or plyosoft box for step ups & mat for planks & side planks. Try it for a week, you’ll like it. Now to sweat, diet off 20 pounds."

I had only been playing the game for maybe 5 minutes when this happen... I have never had any trouble with my game in all the years I’ve been playing... so to me this is a bunch of bs that the one time I have a win over $200,000,000 coming to me the game freezes and doesn’t give me the win...

Furthermore, please add back the classic movement animation from the 6.5.6 update. Please return the stats for all the armors and weapons to their former stats on the 6.8 android update.

Edit: They released a new update and they added robots to free fight robots are too overpowered and they can shoot through walls and it’s impossible to fight them, also tanks have been really nerfed and so have the railpistol this used to be an awesome game But now the robots ruined everything"

I’d like to see some more ifx and some kaoss controls... it’s 10x better on iOS than switch if you’re wondering, touch controls make more sense, things flow. Switch feels odd with a controller, and switch has no extra gadgets or ifx at all. Gadget reminds me a lot of FL studio as far as workspace and flow, very easy to copy patterns, move and edit patterns. The built in gadgets could get you through plenty of songs, but some of the purchase gadgets are well worth it and compliment the available gadgets. I’d highly recommend this, I use it more than Cubasis or GarageBand."

"5832",793157344,"I tried many Twitter clients and this one shows alot of promise. The design is almost perfect but requires tweaking from the top of the home where it doesn't disappear to the actual tweet button. But I find a annoying is the lack the new 240 character count not added. Nor the ability to see #hashtags or @ names as your writing a tweet. Half the time I have to go back and recheck before finishing my tweet. Tweetbot and Twitterrific have this function all ready build in. If your going to make this client successful I suggest you make sure the client is to pair with your rivals cause alot of users are already a custom to things when have them. Otherwise this app is good I look forward to seeing what this app does in the future. I paid for it to show support and keep it up."

I love the music too, it’s soothing and fits into each scene, complementing it rather than being a distraction.  This is art in game form.  I do sometimes wish it were a bit longer and that there was a way to explore more freely, but it’s still a little gem.  Highly recommended, I really hope to see more from this developer someday."

"5869",796959534,"UPDATED UPDATE: This developer proves that his feature-rich approach to inputting text is brilliant. But Nintype still fails to properly interpret many common words. (This technology, pioneered by IBM and eventually migrated to iOS in the long-discontinued Shapewriter, should have been perfected by now!)  UPDATED REVIEW... Very pleased to see this remarkable keyboard finally updated! It now seems more accurate, perhaps even much more accurate! But I must refresh my memory to recall all of its many features! Thanks to the developer for returning to fix his creation. This is one of those apps that you are thrilled to discover, yet are constantly frustrated by it. Every keyboard should have at least a fraction of its clever features. But they don't. Unfortunately, Nintype is unable to fulfill its most basic requirement. After many trials, it seems unable to reliably interpret gesture text-entry, even after giving it time to train itself. A shame!"
"5870",796959534,"Been using this since it first came out. It’s an off and on off again relationship honestly. Before I stopped using the keyboard because of the constant crashes and memory leaks associated with such an advanced keyboard. But it’s been well worth it. Texting and even doing essays with this style of keyboard is amazing and satisfying. It’s realist gratifying once you get the swing of things.   Newest update has made Nintype more stable than ever with almost no crashes ever. I can’t even remember the last time the keyboard would crash at all.   Now the only complaint and a very minute one at that, is that the little mini game that comes with nintype is almost unplayable. It’s very glitchy and holding the spacebar to charge the bump to the next word doesn’t really work correctly anymore.   Ultimately though that’s really a dumb and minor issue to have, but it’s a good example of how great this keyboard truly is. If this is the only issue now then it just shows how awesome nintype has become. Texting, and writing notes on your phone especially in landscape mode is a breeze and it’s amazing truly how fast you can eventually type with this keyboard. Not to mention the haptic feedback and themes you can customize and apply just adds even more content to an already amazing keyboard. Seriously a good job. Can’t ever go back to a regular touch keyboard again."
"5871",796959534,"Out of all the keyboards that are currently out there, this is by far the best keyboard. It brings something new to the table and requires you to put some effort into learning how to use it, but once you do it’s a breeze. It looks awesome and actually feels like a smart keyboard. Once you get the hang of it, typing feels effortless and smooth. The biggest problem is after a while the keyboard is constantly restarting, making it unusable. This I believe is more on Apple than the developer because this problem has affected every 3rd party keyboard I have used. It’s disappointing because I love this keyboard but until Apple fixes its sh*tty platform I won’t be able to use it consistently. At this rate, I’m just going to switch to Android given how iOS hasn’t had a substantial update since Steve passed."

"5873",797157312,"We absolutely love this app but it almost never works. The weather one has no such issue. Bummer."
"5874",797157312,"Perfect app for my 3.5 year old boy. He adores it and played it for 4 hours straight on a recent car ride."
"5875",797535508,"This was the best"
"5876",797535508,"I asked a question and I was taken into a session. The person takes up the whole session but no answer, then i extend the session and that session ends but STILL no answer. Waited for 20 minutes but nothing."
"5877",797535508,"This app is awesome"
"5878",797639732,"Okay so I love the game it’s awesome but I don’t like when you can only take 5 tickets daily from your friends can you update it and let us get all of the tickets our friends send us please and also sometimes I can’t even get 5 tickets sometimes so I would love for you guys to update it soon please. 👍🏻"
"5879",797639732,"This is one of the best theme park games you can get.Ive just gotten it today and it’s awesome,addicting,fun,and creative. Everyone,y’all should get this bc I guarantee you won’t regret it. Btw,in the game,my friend code is GE4LBB...Friend me 👍🏻"
"5880",797639732,"I love this game you guys did great with it. The coasters are awesome and most of the time it is pretty easy to get into the thousands of coins. It would nice if you had a storage option because when you get new things it’s hard to make sure everything fits while moving other things around. The food game that you can play had a glitch with the hamburger buns which is very annoying and if you level up when you are playing the game it just freezes. Other than that the game is pretty awesome."
"5881",797809194,"It’s a great game but and like the gimmicks but the graphics could be better"
"5882",797809194,"I had this app for a while now and there's no music or sound please fix this... like now 😠"

"5887",799406905,"Lots of filters and cool features to choose from."
"5888",799406905,"I do Facebook for a local cookie shop and I have to say, this app is perfect for fun pics. So many cute filters perfect for cute Facebook pictures"
"5889",799406905,"Best App Ever & Sooooo Easy!!!"
"5890",799471892,"Finding a lot of fuel? Well, time for a random encounter where half of it disappears and destroys your telescope. That’s alright, fuel’s been abundant the whole trip? Rest assured it won’t be for the next however many systems you jump to that have gas planets with no fuel.   This game is not difficult; it’s punishing. There is no “playing it safe” or “living to fight another day”. On Easy difficulty, I’ve never had a game last more than 10 star systems - and of absolutely no mistake of my own save for trying desperately to enjoy this game. Alas, I cannot."
"5891",799471892,"You can’t get through it. Why go to all this trouble to create a great experience and then terminate everyone before they can get into the game?  Fail."
"5892",799471892,"This was a pretty cool game....but unfortunately doesn’t run well on the new iPad Air."
"5893",803346990,"This game is terrible. Not worth the money. It was only two dollars but not worth that. The hockey game is a shootout not a game and there is no rhyme or reason where the puck is gonna go. The skating race has a clitch that once the race is over the game doesn’t realize the race is over and you can’t move on to the next competition.  The graphics are terrible. I want my money back."
"5894",803346990,"Amazing"
"5895",803346990,"I like this game. Try “Athletics 2” also."
"5896",803781859,"优化一下有这么困难吗？！动不动就闪退，怎么用嘛？我请问您。每次查一道题就要闪退一次，我就要重新开一次，这么久了不能优化一下吗，而且打开巨吃内存，广告到处都是，带都带不动？"

"5899",804177739,"Using this on the iPad is pretty intuitive and the tutorials are super helpful for someone beginning to learn how to edit."
"5900",804177739,"Prevents split screen. (And provides no side by side comparison feature) so i have no way to match photos. I also can’t move the photo order. Renaming and then sorting by alphabetical not working either.  Really slows down productivity, and makes the app close to useless for me."
"5901",804177739,"Please, please, work with GOOGLE PHOTOS APP and get a tab to easily export edited photos to google shared albums and photo backup. At the moment it is so complicated🥴 I know you app developers can help us photographers out! Love your app for editing, but people want google shares and the process stinks right now!!! Thanks."
"5902",804379658,"It is ridiculous to have to sit through up to 30 seconds of ads between moves.  This used to be my favorite game. Until this is fixed-I quit."
"5903",804379658,"This app hangs-up all the time.  I mean every minute it lags for 10 or 15 seconds.  My impression is The developers are far more concerned about pushing content at me than making the game work."
"5904",804379658,"Words with friends is fine, but the ads detract to an intolerable degree. That’s why I just play with relatives. Paid $9.99 to remove ads forever, but was only for one month. Please..."
"5905",804637783,"This is the only iOS app for which I have paid, and I am glad I did. I use it daily, and regularly in about 10 languages. PROS: The translations are so good, and the Copy and Paste function works so well, that recipients in Chat sometimes do not realize I am not a native speaker. The app handles long blocks of text well. CONS: Speech to Text and Speech to Speech do not work reliably; sometimes they do not work at all, while others produce an “Internet connection too slow” message, even though it runs at over 100 Mbps. Much of the time I get nonsense for dictated speech. WISHLIST: 1. Having several choices for single words would be good, as words can have several senses. However, the app almost always gets it right. 2. A list longer than the 4 previous “Recently Used” languages would be a timesaver, or the option to select a longer list. (I just suggested this to the developers.)"
"5906",804637783,"5 Stars easy"
"5907",804637783,"I'm in China with my wife and when she's not around, or when I'm talking to her family, this translates Mandarin really well. Even my wife was impressed because Google translate gets it wrong so often. Definitely worth the cost so far and would highly recommend it, for China at least."
"5908",804641004,"This app is not friendly for people who are using the free version. Pop ups after a short while make it unusable. Do not give your money to developers who are in the business of lying."
"5909",804641004,"Functionality is poor."
"5910",804641004,"This may or may not be a good app. The cancellation after a free trial is very confusing. I have suspicion about an app or anyvproduct that makes it difficult to cancel."
"5911",804888540,"I paid for photon x even though I already had the app, thinking it would have an updated browser, but I still can’t play candy crush or words with friends on it. Bummed."

"5913",804888540,"Distorts video stream in Vaughnlive.tv Limits control buttons on screen. Some quit working . Lost a buck on this one."
"5914",805839157,"The slow mo breaks flow."
"5915",805839157,"It's an ok infinite runner but there's very little challenge and once you have played the game for 5 minutes you have seen everything it has to offer. The only increase in difficulty is that the enemies get slightly more frequent, and you will eventually make a mistake. Probably due to boredom. 3 stars because this game has no flaws (it functions as designed) except that it's more of a demo than a full game."
"5916",805839157,"Ran out of cool space games and stumbled on this one. Love it!!"
"5917",805845189,"This game froze and I cannot play it anymore,,fix this bug please and 5 stars if bug fixed ok 🤨"
"5918",805845189,"Omg I can’t stop playing this game.it is the best game I ever played"
"5919",805845189,"I was liking this game until I got stopped to do a challenge in order to advance. That's fine. Needed to pass 3. After passing the first, it tells me I have to either pay or wait 24 hours to play the next challenge. I waited. The timer is not accurate & still doesn't let me play. Deleting. VERY aggravating."
"5920",805869467,"I love it Tynker! But some things that need to be added.Villagers,the pillager update,dolphins,sea turtles,and other mobs that aren’t in here that are in Minecraft.Plus I wish I could add my own sound from my files so I can animate characters with sound instead of longing in on the website and adding the sound.Plus my mom doesn’t allow me on her computer much.Hopefully this will get to the creators attention to start on this."
"5921",805869467,"The game is soo fun and it helps you code I love to do it and all of you seeing this I hope you play this game it’s a for star one pls play this awesome game.ps lexy"
"5922",805869467,"I love this game!! However only one problem. I wanted to edit the wolf skin and tamed wolf skin. They were both locked. So that basically meant that I had to go on community, find skins, and edit them that way."
"5923",806077016,"It’s all rigged and it’s all about padding the developers pockets. Just wait and see."
"5924",806077016,"By far the best mech/robot game I’ve ever played like tf2(titan fall2)"
"5925",806077016,"This game is the best and I can,t stop laying it"
"5926",806223188,"Too many of these games have really inadequate instructions. I got really frustrated and had to google some of them. I thought that was ridiculous, given how clear it became after googling. Why didn’t it just say so in the first place? Honestly I don’t think my brain is improving either. My scores go up and down."
"5927",806223188,"There was a recent upgrade and now right after I play a game I don’t get the screen which lets you see your progress in meeting goals. I find it very frustrating since I have to exit the workout and then go back in and choose a game I already played to see if I made progress toward a goal or not. Please let that screen pop up after completing a game."
"5928",806223188,"How are people supposed to know which arbitrary rotations of differing arbitrary shapes are “the same” (so the answer is “partly”) or “different” (so the answer is “no”)?"
"5929",807411101,"Ok"
"5930",807411101,"this is mainly in-app-purchases, so you only got to make like I dunno like 4 things. That’s the thing with tabtale. You can’t do anything with It! It’s a waste of time"
"5931",807411101,"This is worse then other games."
"5932",808108897,"I love this game but it needs work. It would be much funner if you could pick the injuries for the pets, it would also be funner if you had to find out the injury with vet tools. And it needs more animals, it gets boring doing the same animals over and over again. But overall this game is pretty fun."
"5933",808108897,"My very young niece purchased this game by accident and I would like to get my money back. I’ve been looking for a way to cancel the purchase or at the very least communicate with someone about this but can’t seem to find the report a problem button. Please help."
"5934",808108897,"I love this game. It was very fun"
"5935",808296431,"I Like it allot there’s so much to do in story mode. But the thing with creative mode is there should be bosses ,creative mode trinkets and npc’s"
"5936",808296431,"I played Crashlands and enjoyed it a lot until this morning when playing the tundra level and warped back to savannah to find that all of my buildings and pets are completely gone and the map reset and all of my exploring is gone.  I registered and have been saving my game often, to no avail apparently.  So, I recommend the game if you want to play and suddenly have all of your progress disappear about 75% of the way through the game, but otherwise could not due to the disappointment."
"5937",808296431,"I am currently on my third play through of the game and I love it so much! The jokes never get old I always find something new on every play through even though I’ve had this game since launch and it keeps getting better but just please don’t abandon the game. It has such potential but know that I’m done ranting I’ll actually give suggestions. Make it so that creatures can attack through walls even though it’s fun it’s to easy to whack things like glidopods through walls. Add a local multiplayer function and please not like the couch Co op sure it’s fun to play as juice box but it’s much more fun to play as flux and have the ability to be constantly getting stronger also add a utility slot so that you can put something like a harvest bomb in there and don’t have to switch it to a normal slot. Also please expand on pets in stead of just growing or evolving them make it so that you can make them gear. And that’s it thanks for making such amazing games and I hope that if you read this wich you probably didn’t you take some off the suggestions anyway that’s it."
"5938",808794344,"Don’t bother."
"5939",808794344,"Have been loving the Olympics, though watching in Hawaii, everything is over by the time we get it. I end up watching a lot of double coverage, it’s in reruns when we get it. Love the curling and biathlon , speed skating, short track , well everything, have loved seeing the respect between participants, it’s heartwarming. Real sportsmanship!"
"5940",808794344,"Half the time the content won’t load. The schedule is laughable. In this age of technology, it’s pretty sad that this app is such a major fail."
"5941",810405576,"I love this game!  I have all my students buy it to help with their note reading.  I especially love that tenor clef was recently added.  The only thing it’s missing now is a setting to combine some or all of the clefs in one game to practice switching between them in real time (like for advanced cellists who have to read bass, tenor and treble clef fluidly; or violists who frequently switch between alto and treble clef).  Maybe make this upgrade at some point in the future?  I would even pay a higher price for a “Pro” version that has this feature.  In any case, thanks to the developers for the awesome app!"
"5942",810405576,"This is amazing. Any bad reviews don’t make sense. This game is great. My piano teacher recommends this and it’s fun. No ads all education for the piano. This is ligit."
"5943",810405576,"Fun and helpful for a violinist who dabbles with occasional viola parts. I wish notes on ledger lines came while it is still slow so I could get used to what they look like."
"5944",811397653,"Simple fun. The music in this game is awesome. The song that plays during the actual dungeon run, should it ever be played by a real heavy metal band, it would be an anthem.  I have opened this game just to listen to that song before. :-)"
"5945",811397653,"Shouldn’t even come up in a “match 3” search. The difficult mental shift to these...alternative...marching mechanics makes the game unfun."
"5946",811397653,"This game has been a bigger headache than any other match 3 game I’ve ever played. Some would say that’s good, and I definitely think that has its place, but I think this game would really benefit from an easy mode. Some people like perpetual ramping-up difficulty, but every now and again I just want to have some mindless fun and wreck shop in a dungeon. A zen mode unlocked after the main campaign could be an alternative. At this rate, I feel like I’m going to reach a point where this game becomes too frustrating to be fun to play."
"5947",813330182,"While there is a certain playstyle the game loves, it still gives you an huge array of ways to play your way. There are different ways to interact with most everything, and you can't become dependent on one factor alone to win, unless you're willing to accept a near endless chaotic campaign. Deep, fun, kind feeling as you interact with various organizations, endless character and the best art style and strategy, this game is the best on the App Store.  Still, its long and not worth a buy if you plan to update, definitely amazing. As close to beyond perfect as any GS on here."
"5948",813330182,"Love this game! Perfect strategy game for iOS. Also fun with the real time battle stuff. If you like Civs on computer, this is a perfect, mobile, dumbed-down version. Can we get it updated tho??? I can’t play and I’m sad."
"5949",813330182,"Probably the best strategy game I've played on the phone. Reminiscent of the total war games for PC but with its differences. Game hasn't crashed and I haven't run into any bugs. Super fun and I definitely recommend.  Will raise back to 5 stars when it is updated for new iOS"
"5950",814323051,"Like that it’s challenging, but would have liked a tutorial on some sort of basics of bridge structure having no experience with any sort of physics, kinda a dummy 😅😅😅. Otherwise, good challenging game."
"5951",814323051,"This so far is the least fun out of an otherwise enjoyable series. The limits on materials take away from the creativity of the other games and the addition of in-app purchases is a disappointment. Gameplay is also less enjoyable. The units crossing the bridge move incredibly slow making the design/testing process too cumbersome."
"5952",814323051,"I don’t know about other people it’s just the screaming when the bridge brakes into two or just collapses when they die they scream and I find it very annoying so ether get rid of it or try to make it less annoying but I’ll still play it"
"5953",814466047,"I’ve had Star Horizon for many years and I’ve played it several times. It’s one of my all-time favorite video games. I even own Star Horizon on android.   A few years back I had an issue and I contacted customer support. She was very friendly and helpful and resolve my issue."

"5956",814656403,"Change the limit on the food and take away the time clock on when I can purchase the food I need. It’s to hard to go any further on this game. I’m thinking about deleting it cause I’m enjoying bakery stories it’s a much better game."
"5957",814656403,"Awesome game"
"5958",814656403,"App can be fun and addictive but there have been too many times when I have cooked food for hours only for it not to show up on my counter. Storm8, 2 six hour recipes for French dip sandwiches should equal 900 sandwiches, not 200. Done."
"5959",814977594,"I bought this game thinking it was going to be fun. Turns out this game isn’t fun and is a waste of your money I don’t recommend buying this game. I would like my money back if there is someone to talk to about this that would be awesome thanks."
"5960",814977594,"It’s great but add more"
"5961",814977594,"Pls help I don’t have heart rate"
"5962",815181808,"this game is captivating, beautiful, and deserves way more content! it’s very full as is, but i do wish they’d work on a new one. i have a tip for any new players, SAVE YOUR GEMS! you need them to keep the happiness of your followers up, trust me!"
"5963",815181808,"I started playing on my iPhone and realize that it was more comfortable in the iPad, I decide to start playing on the ipad but weren’t able to continue my game.

"5965",815218412,"I can’t help but notice that this apps program does not encompass my iPhones full screen, it does not fill the whole screen and leaves a half inch of blackness on bottom and top. I assume this is because this is an older app and you haven’t made any updates for the newer phones. If you’d be so kind I’d like to see an update but other than that it’s a fantastic app to use for vocabulary. This app does a great job at explaining what something means and it makes it fun."
"5966",815218412,"As someone who’s trying to increase vocabulary you’d think they’d have an option to save certain words but they didn’t."
"5967",815218412,"I have an account through google and there is no option to sign in through google. Waste of $3."
"5968",816202468,"Just that. This game is a lot of fun to play. I highly recommend it."
"5969",816202468,"It was amazing I enjoyed all of the references and all of the waster eggs don't be afraid to tap EVRYTHING.  PS twitter and Facebook"
"5970",816202468,"Best game in the world"
"5971",816283225,"I got this game a few weeks ago but it is AMAZING. I have so much fun in not so fun situations. But there was a graphic glitch where the second skin of barnarnas hand is a placeholder instead of the chicken leg this is really annoying me so if you can fix it that would be GREAT thanks!!"
"5972",816283225,"It’s seriously out of control. When starting out, you’ll be lucky to play for 15 seconds between 30 second ad breaks. As the title says, I had 6 30-second ad breaks in the 5 minutes I had the app open. Could be decent to play on the train, but I doubt I’ll ever open the app again. It’s absolutely shameful that this was an “Editor’s Choice"" app."
"5973",816283225,"So the games fun, so fun that I decided that I wanted to support the game by buying the pro tour thing it was 99cents, it came with 1k gold 100 free gold claw things, not sure what that is, a character, unlimited access to the pro tour game mode, and it would remove ads. I bought it got the character, 1k gold, and unlimited access to the pro tour mode. I still get ads and I have no clue what the 100 gold claw things were, tbh I don’t really care about the gold claw thing, but I hate that it didn’t remove ads it’s stupid I paid the 99 cents so the ads should be removed, that’s the only issue I have. Games fun, besides getting scammed, it’s only 99 cents so I don’t really care but it’s scummy nonetheless. 3/5"
"5974",816821851,"I had several apps that was able to remove.  Ytools has a superior look and feel"
"5975",816821851,"I have several measurement apps on my phone, but I've gone through a couple dozen to find the best for particular purposes.  This one is the best in its class by far and worth paying for.   I work with a lot of small items and I'm bad at judging their size by sight or knowing how big something is by its description, this solves those issues quickly.  I especially love that I can quickly toggle between metric and imperial measurements.  I've made use of some of its other features too, but the measurement tool is fantastic on its own.  I also appreciate the not white background."
"5976",816821851,"So many other apps have the same tools but this one has some very useful apps all I'm one place, easy to access, easy to use."

"5984",819627009,"I’m a pharmacist who used to use this app as an alternative to more expensive drug information databases. It was helpful for when I’m away from my computer and with patients or when people asked me questions when I’m not at work.  A recent bug that other users have mentioned has rendered the app useless. It works fine when you download it at first. When the app updates once, it gets stuck on the last drug that was searched. The only way to look up a new drug is to delete the app and re-download. There’s also a bug where all headings within the drug’s page pull up the same information. Currently, information for the “dosing and indications” tab pulls up when you open all other tabs. The interactions database appears to work fine.  IBM needs to fix this before they lose all their users. I’m upgrading to a better database."
"5985",819627009,"This app is stuck on one medication. No matter which drug I click on, the same medication comes up each time. This makes the app a useless was of time and money. Please fix this!"

"5992",821399915,"Good"
"5993",821399915,"挺好玩的"
"5994",821399915,"Dftgxghhjjjjjjjjjjjkjhhhhgvvgdghh"
"5995",821560738,"Not user friendly have trouble getting it to work."
"5996",821560738,"I am a fontaholic and I went many years without knowing this app existed, until last year! It’s so easy to use and allows you to add all the fonts you want! Thank you!"
"5997",821560738,"Great app"
"5998",822701037,"The game has a nice concept, was challenging enough at times, but short-lived and super frustrating at the end. The entire game was kinda easy, but then at the orange level everything was super difficult and near impossible to finish. I’m not even sure some of the levels there were actually possible to finish. So I gave up after 100+ tries and looked up a walkthrough to see what would happen at the end. Guess what? It’s an empty orange room with absolutely nothing in sight. So don’t waste your time trying to beat the orange level, you’ll hardly be rewarded. The insane difficulty on the last level just seemed to be an excuse to lengthen the already super short game."
"5999",822701037,"Man, this game is just amazing. The combination of frustrating and fun is amazing. And I especially love the “Orange Levels”. I can say that I have beaten the orange levels, and the ending is a bit anti-climatic. Either way, I love the game."
"6000",822701037,"Amazing game like I’ve never written one of thes before but I loved the game sm that I took time outta my day to write one... one of the best games I’ve ever played if not the best... would recommend playing with headphones tho"
"6001",822797943,"I think it is a great way to write."
"6002",822797943,"I can’t even type a sentence without losing my train of thought with the auto insert. I would like to use this app again. I’m not sure what the latest update has done but I would like it to go back to the previous version. :("
"6003",822797943,"The translation is literal it doesn’t help to understand the meaning. Doesn’t cover the sayings :/"
"6004",823413326,"What happened? Now I can not add other locations? Updated iOS now paying the price!"
"6005",823413326,"I love it!"
"6006",823413326,"Love it"
"6007",823443083,"Thank you a ton!! Great app and very intuitive with a clean UI!  Thanks a ton!  Spence"
"6008",823443083,"Super App!"
"6009",823443083,"Never write reviews but this app is phenomenal I swear 10000% suggest it"
"6010",823518885,"Why just a Minecraft scam idiots"
"6011",823518885,"I could not move or mine anything! And there are no other players, I hate this!!!"
"6012",823518885,"Bruh when I first got dis game I thought it would be soooo much fun but the truth is this is worse than any other app I’ve ever seen. I rather spend 7 dollars on Minecraft than play this garbage do not download plz if u waste ur time downloading this garbage than ur weird."
"6013",823804745,"this app is overall good but it is filled to the brim with players who beg for endgame items when they should get them their self and the people who drop items for them and defend them are as bad if not worse some of the beggars are really rude and swear at people who kill them for begging i used wired explosives to kill a beggar and he got mad and swore at me i joined an all items map and killed the owner with explosives for trying to attract beggars he left so i got disconnected then he swore at me in this apps chat that is why i remove 2 stars"
"6014",823804745,"This app is awesome whoever made this app needs to be promoted to anything I got cool stuff I was a newborns annoying and cool stuff from anywhere"
"6015",823804745,"It is an amazing app for Terraria and it worked fine but until the new 1.3 update for Terraria mobile it doesn't work anymore. I also can't use the Terraria multiplayer section because I can only use local but not online. If you are able to, make an updated version for 1.3 edition on mobile. Would appreciate it!!!"
"6016",823869162,"Okay I love this game I built so many airplanes like b-17, b-24, b-26, MD-11,Boeing 737, and Dc-3. I built WW2 ships and bombers like  T2 tanker, USS Iowa, A-26, A6m Zero, he-111, USS   Montana, and BF-109. Great game."
"6017",823869162,"In a plane building app, I suppose there’s always more you can add, really though, the only changes I’d like would be: 1-More Weapons 2-Website in-app  It’s not too difficult to just use the website, it would just be nice if it had its own app or part in the app. A lot of the accessibility is on the PC but there should at least be an account manager in-app."
"6018",823869162,"I used to have this game on my little kindle fire as a kid and it was great but now I got on and then got a text so I texted back and when I got back on it crashed, so I loaded the game again and it was just the grey loading screen and it wouldn’t change. Anyone know how to fix that?"
"6019",824281761,"When is sago mini big city gonna come out as standalone? You should also update the app. It’s June and it’s not Halloween anymore. Halloween is in 4 months."
"6020",824281761,"My two year old loves this game, I just wish it didn’t have holiday themes. We don’t celebrate and since it’s December now I would expect the Halloween theme to be gone, but I guess not. 🤔"
"6021",824281761,"just glad I got it for free .. Some of this devs apps are good this one ..this one is just plain sad ..  Toca Mini has more to it then this ... Toca Mini : FEATURES • Add amazing animated eyes, mouths, noses and eyebrows • Choose from 60 colors and 78 reversible stamps • Use stamps to create patterns, hair and clothes • Take a snapshot and share your Minis! • Lots of colorful backgrounds to choose from!  • Your Mini makes fun gestures and sounds as you're creating • No rules or stress - create and play anyway you want! • Kid-friendly interface • No third-party advertising • No in-app purchases .........................................................  Pro's I got it free   Con's  5 paints pink, blue, yellow, orange, purple.. Very little to do besides poking out some eyes and features Limited creativity  Limited features few options for eyes, horns and mouths ... Your forced to have these as well meaning you can't make the monster have 2 or one u have have to have 3 eyes you have to have horns ..no freedom .. Limited items for the head/body.. Limited things to do ..just brush its teeth then they reset the monster ..."
"6022",824305459,"Games is fun! I used to play on Computer! Nothing to but in the store nothing to do other than serve 6 people a day. Sad thing is the developers of this game have no regard to all the other complaints left years ago! I’m upset because I expected more...... not about the $.99!"
"6023",824305459,"I played this in Coolmath often in school before the website got blocked by my district. This game is unique. I can’t find other games like this, but if there are games like this then I know they will never have the same style and look as these games. Papa’s Freezeria was definitely the first Papa game I ever played. Downloading and playing this brought back a feeling of nostalgia and I’m sure that I’ll keep playing for a long time. Nothing beats the first Papa game you play."
"6024",824305459,"I’ve played all papas games they have a special place in my heart😭😂 I love these games"
"6025",824421012,"This is beyond any other “art filter” app out there! The filters are subtle and keep the integrity of any photo. Totally worth the money!"
"6026",824421012,"Loved this app but was not opening on my iPhone X. The develop a team reached out to me and suggested deleting the app and re-downloading it. I did that and all is good  A few months later I am trying the same remedy as the app no longer opens."
"6027",824421012,"You have to try it and keep it!"
"6028",825089659,"I love to play FoE and figured this app would run better that the free version of regular Photon.......Nope I was wrong! Would love to get my money back but of course that's a waste of breath! I give it no rating because it didn't work at all for what I wanted it for. Oh that's right I have to give it a star just to send this review...SMH!"
"6029",825089659,"Freezes so much it is USELESS!"
"6030",825089659,"The screen freezes whenever the device is rotated while in flash mode."
"6031",826523703,"It is the best game in the world"
"6032",826523703,"Too many ads"
"6033",826523703,"Let me start with love and say I’m addicted to this game....BUT, and this is a big BUT, the connection issues and how you get screwed out of coins(and messes up your win record)when you re-connect is a big disappointment, and it happens at the worst of times it seems. You could take a shot with plenty of time left, make the shot, then there’s a connection issue, then you get reconnected, and it’s like your shot never happened and you’re opponent is shooting now. Come on guys, this has gone on for TOO long! For that you’re getting a 2 stars review ;("
"6034",826921329,"This software always works"
"6035",826921329,"Great app does what I wanted"
"6036",826921329,"The features are nice and easy,I would recommend possibly more shading options. App is good fun"
"6037",828005193,"I used to love this game but like other apps, with time it’s become more about getting players’ money. I’m pretty sure the level 2 items are much more expensive than they were before. I had to start over bc I’m on a whole new account so I was able to see some differences. The customers lose their patience much faster and everything takes longer to make food which obviously makes it hard to serve customers with 5 hearts. By the time I even get the food item to an appliance to start making it, the customer is down a heart. It definitely wasn’t like this before because I would not have played it so much, nor would I have bothered to re-downloaded it. There also weren’t any ads before but I guess I understand those. However, if I’m gonna be forced to sit through a video, it seems like I could at least get some kind of in-game currency. I wish this game would go back to normal but I also wish they would give more supplies or just kinda do away with that limitation."
"6038",828005193,"I’ve played this game since 2016 and with all the changes it is so different me and my sister used to love bragging to each other about levels now it so different 😐"
"6039",828005193,"My issue is with kitchen scramble. My issue is that I’ve gotten to level 366 and I cannot place the pancake mix in the mixing bowl with fruit. Please help. It won’t let the pancake mix (flour eggs and milk) after coming out of the mixer to go into the mixing bowl with fruit."
"6040",828392046,"My daughter loves this.  Its incredible how well this teaches phonetic (and sight) reading.  It definitely requires parental guidance though; do not send kids off to play this by themselves.  This program builds up new skills and sight words FAST, often using sight words that the student hasn’t seen as the answer (it’s a good thing; students figure them out by process of elimination and are never shown two new words at once and are required to recall or sound out multiple previously seen words ).  By comparison, ABCmouse seems galacially paced.  Most kids will do better if an adult is there to help them walk through the words when they forget a skill or get confused."
"6041",828392046,"I recently purchased and wouldn’t allow me to download, what a let down."
"6042",828392046,"My son was in Pre-K and we wanted a fun app that would get him ready for school. Tried a bunch of the others including ABC Mouse and he gave up on them easily. He loved this one. Both him and his brother challenged each other to get stars and build the spaceships. After one year he is reading “Level 2” books on his own as he heads into Kindergarten and a huge part of that is due to this app."
"6043",828578246,"The latest update has unfortunately  undone much of my progress. Developers have ignored my requests for help."
"6044",828578246,"Did the update. Went to answer a call game resets faster now.  Lost current play.  Don’t use coins in game play unless you going to play continually.  Game will reset."
"6045",828578246,"Since the last update, I find gummy really not as much fun.  Seems if you spend some money to buy coins or rewards they are make the game easier.  If you don’t spend money, they won’t let you win at all.  It was my favorite game till this last update 😢"
"6046",829581836,"Usability is great an app is extremely helpful.. the interface design and colors are very bad."

"6049",829587759,"I’ve only had this app for a week started with no experience and have already successfully had my first Russian conversation! Thanks Babbel!!"
"6050",829587759,"I felt like I must have skipped a lesson or two in there when it came to the verbs- they lost me"
"6051",829587759,"Enjoying it so far. I need to become comfortable with Spanish. Not bilingual but able to at least take a stab at casual conversation. The app is easy and kind of fun."
"6052",829739720,"I have in app ratings turned off but it asked anyway. This rating is based upon the blatant disrespect for my wishes."
"6053",829739720,"Not optimized for iPhone X and probably some other iPhones as well, missing features and poor maintenance from the developer."
"6054",829739720,"This is the only app that I have found so far that actually works. It stays connected and I’m able to surf the web . TYTYTY"
"6055",830302503,"English"
"6056",830302503,"Good"

"6058",830515294,"Please bring back the original where it’s no background noises no lady with you stock and original models and the original free-to-pickup-privalleges I like the original more than I do this version the game is good but I highly recommend this"
"6059",830515294,"I think it’s the best app ever but if thay could let you drive the car but it is not really the best game because also thay only let you customize only one car so I had to wait for a hole hour for the game to load ."
"6060",830515294,"To short and can’t return for refund I will not purchase from fire rabbit again till I’m able to refund my app"
"6061",830544402,"The reimagined graphics are amazing and the story is great. It hooks you before you even start the game."
"6062",830544402,"This is so good a balanced amount of storyline and hard and challenging is a amazing touch"
"6063",830544402,"So much fun. Intense moments. Worth every penny."
"6064",830708155,"Unfortunately this app does not contain the tools that I needed, and so I deleted it and replaced it with another app.  It is not a bad app - it just doesn’t have the abilities I want in a calendar."
"6065",830708155,"I make a change in my google calendar and it can take hours for it to reflect in Fantastical. This never used to happen."
"6066",830708155,"This app needs a total reworking towards an intuitive UE: There is no monthly calendar as such, which means you can't see groups or patterns of exact entries — the native iPad monthly calendar is near perfect; the Fantastical bars on the weekly view are laughable — who knows what they communicate; and, empty days don't show in the laborious dot/agenda list, adding to the confusion. (Outlook has this just right.) It's an app that fails at being quick and intuitive. Use the iPad calendar and use Reminders, and you will have a better calendar experience and save your money. (But, Fantastical does have a terrific widget!)"
"6067",833517462,"I hate how i can only do like 2 dances and the max is 200 coins make it like at least 1000 and we could get 200 each day or put no limit"
"6068",833517462,"the screen for smart phone wont load its just a black screen fix it please"
"6069",833517462,"I wish had a more variety of artist like hip hop not just pop and a way to choose songs by those artist you enjoy."
"6070",833756002,"This game goes Stu"
"6071",833756002,"If you have angry issues and you like to get all of the golden stars then I don’t suggest you playing this game, trust me after beating five stages my iPad had two cracks in it. Again DON’T PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE ANGRY ISSUES but if you have a lot of patience then go ahead!"
"6072",833756002,"The game is really entertaining and it’s just challenging enough! My little cousins love it and my grandma loves it!"
"6073",833951143,"Eg. I took the Zoltan ship which has a special shield that stops teleportation. 3 times in a row I was destroyed in the second sector by boarding parties that just ignore the shield and stomp my wimpy crew. No strategy or skill could prevent the wipe out.  It’s not a bad game if RNG is your thing.  I just do not equate a game overwhelmingly dependent on RNG luck to a good strategic challenge, however. The interface is well designed and easy to interact with & use.  Good graphics.  Reply ability with different ships is dependent on unlocks which are heavily dependent on RNG.   Do you feel lucky punk? Do you?  If you’re looking to save money flip a coin.  Get heads 5 times in a row you WIN! Otherwise you loose.  Thats FTL in a nutshell."
"6074",833951143,"For the most part the only reason people are bashing this game is because it’s too hard. The reason of the game is to play through many times, develop a strategy, form a plan to finally beat the game. When you do beat the game after losing 40 times it’s amazing and worth while. If you could save the game and continue it would get old way to fast and your actions would not have consequences. Yes it’s hard, but totally worth it."
"6075",833951143,"Great game but no updates for 2+ years. That means it doesn’t fit the screen sizes of a lot of modern devices like the iPad Pro 11”."
"6076",833958016,"It says the game is free but after the first chapter you have to pay for the rest. Don’t lead us on then hit us with money, just make the game a paid game!"
"6077",833958016,"I love this game but I’m 13 and I got no money so I can’t play anymore than the first episode."
"6078",833958016,"This is one of the few games that I couldn’t wait to finish it. The only issue I have was that I need to have a chapter 10.Maybe they stop at 9 because that’s how they want us to remember. To remember that our love story truly never finishes and it’s up to us to continue it."
"6079",834246564,"The reason why it’s boring is because most of the stuff is “In App Purchase” so basically we can’t finish up our “clients”. It’s not fair because my cousin has this game and she has LG. I have an iPhone but her games and tools are unlocked! I don’t know why apps make specific things for specific devices. It’s sad, there is too much ads and pop ups. This game sometimes freezes and glitches. It was fun at first until I saw that all the most needed items were locked. If I was TabTale I would make less ads and no items locked. TabTale, if you are reading this your games are interesting but needs a little fixing...ALOT!🙄"
"6080",834246564,"Sssssssoooooooo boring"
"6081",834246564,"I am sick of this ( KIDS FUN CLUB BY TAB TALE 😒😡😡😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎) always Cost money in every game this is an 5 to 7 year old you care all about the money , and not the children all you do is take kids money not cool 👎👎👎👎 what if you were us and we took you money ."
"6082",834248867,"I can’t even use it. It keeps crashing. Don’t waste your money."
"6083",834248867,"The app is broken and not working. DO NOT BUY THIS APP"
"6084",834248867,"Didn’t optimized for iPhone X and later,do it?"
"6085",834315918,"I’d honestly recommend this game to fans of splinter cell it takes patience and it pays off 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"6086",834315918,"Gooooooood game👍👍👍👍👍"
"6087",834315918,"Pleaseeee!!🙏"
"6088",834715612,"If you played resident evil 1-5 this is the game you should definitely have on your mobile. One of the best games that reminds me for Resident evil series on a mobile. I’m glad I found this. Not bad for a phone game."
"6089",834715612,"I have beaten the game today ,I am not the touch the screen type of games gal yet I have immensely enjoyed this one . Upon my previous PlayStation games experience especially silent hill this game was amazing ,nice graphics and story line ,morbid creepy themes . One last say to the game developers .i wouldn’t say it is a silent hill rip off yet I would say it’s a spitting image of it . Even the way the avatar moves .,melee weapons ,the mannequins. Good job looking forward to meet the developers on the PlayStation games market soon"
"6090",834715612,"This game is not jump scares, but it has a great setting, music, voice acting and cut scenes. It was done incredibly well despite not the most user friendly game controls. It has manual saves, so it feels like a bit of a throwback and it really did create a sense of fear that many movies and games haven't done since some of the classics. It's done phenomenally well and a no brainer if you want a legitimate horror video game experience, imho."
"6091",834854351,"The free Scanbot is good but not necessarily better than other free scanners. In fact, there are other free scanners that can do more than Scanbot. All the locked features are available on Scanbot Pro for $70. However, even those premium features are free in other free scanners, so whenever there is a limitation in one scanner, I simply move to the next scanner that does offer that feature for free.   Most free scanners have limitations, but, as long as I move from one free scanner to the next, I basically get to use the “premium” features.  I hope Scanbot Pro can reasonably reduce the price in half, because with the availability of free apps and in-app purchases, few people would pay monthly for a scanner."
"6092",834854351,"Fantastic App, super easy to use, very common sense navigation and no convoluted processes. I’ve tried many different scanning apps to gather my information and eliminate paperwork but none are like this one.  I can’t recommend abetter app out there and would encourage anyone to grab this one!"
"6093",834854351,"The scan quality of music with my iPad Pro is terrible. When i take a photo of music it is just fine."
"6094",834993441,"At first I loved this game, but as I have progressed it has nothing to offer. I have amassed and spent over 50,000,000 gold and it’s pointless. I have all of the wands and all of the hats and armors. I am at level 111 in the endless dungeons and nothing changes. No matter how much attack power I add, the tougher enemies still take just as long to defeat, regardless of the wand I’m using and the weaker ones blow over like dust bunnies.   Like I said, it started out great, but it could offer more."
"6095",834993441,"This game should be a 😱 because it is the best game ever it has scary monsters like this emoji 🧟‍♂️this game is educational and it is super addictive if you don’t like the game I will 🤬👿👺on you so yeah it is the best"
"6096",834993441,"I enjoy the game, but it is quite difficult for the kids I work with. They are dyslexic and have a hard time finding words so quickly without dying right away. The kids love killing the monsters!  I would love to see an option where you can either have no timer or that the timer can be  set to be slowed down. MG"
"6097",835217317,"can’t find it on Apple Music? Datpiff got it"
"6098",835217317,"Been with datpiff for 10 years plus. Still rocking wit it!"
"6099",835217317,"No or rare got me what I want, huge library."
"6100",835599320,"I love you ❤️"
"6101",835599320,"Now it won’t play the audio so you know where to stop the segment at in the timer this needs to be fixed ASAP"
"6102",835599320,"i started out small but then grew my account and at first i got it as a joke like we all did but then, I go on it about 4 hours of my day! All the videos are amazing and I love making content of my own. It’s really fun, keep on going tiktok!❤️"
"6103",835731296,"This app is now the best ever, I love it! I had to wait for awhile for this to happen, but now everything’s perfect!  And they have a new feature where the music scrolls for you at your own pace, I strongly recommend this app!"
"6104",835731296,"I love MuseScore"
"6105",835731296,"There are a lot of bugs but when it works it works really well great app. Sometimes logs me out for no reason though and won’t let me search music."
"6106",835969177,"Awesome game 10/10"
"6107",835969177,"I don’t know how to get the APC.  But I love the game"
"6108",835969177,"I like this game and it is really fun. I have loved cars and trucks since I was a baby. The thing I most like about cars is the wheels. They look cool and I just wanted to say I like this game and it’s cool. Thank you for making this game!"
"6109",836071680,"They never fix tech problems and they made an update that created more,Abe Lincoln and bill Clinton are not the same person are they really that retarted?! Ps.they never answer emails anymore!"
"6110",836071680,"I have had wishbone for a while and I love it! I have a pretty successful account and I love all the different packs you can vote on. The only thing I’d change is how many adds there are. You can’t go a couple of votes without getting an add."
"6111",836071680,"You totally ruined the game, it have a lot of ads"
"6112",836464625,"THANK YOU to the creators for making this app! Just WOW! Anatomy and foreshortening are two of the hardest subjects to master, and this app addresses both masterfully! Being able to pose however you want and add realistic lighting makes drawing accurately sooo much easier. Looove it so much, bought the bundle. It's a must for visual artists! Thank you!🙏🏽"
"6113",836464625,"Update: man thanks so much for removing the background for the models, this really helps out so much!!  Such an awesome app in both versions. I use this a lot and would like to see other things added like the ability to have the option to bring in another pose model or two so you can have a duo set atleast like for posing a fight scene ect. And perhaps even props/accessories  to use like sword, pistol, chair, stump ect. and a creature model version of this would be awesome as well. Hope to see much more!!"
"6114",836464625,"I love this app a lot can’t ask for much more.  You get everything you need to create awesome poses in which you can screen shot and use for references while drawing rather digitally or non-digitally.  The only thing I would be awesome for this app is to adjust body weight not just by muscle mass, but also by body fat.  One other thing would be to add in some props like:  weapons, furniture, cell phones, computers, and drinking mugs. However the app is fine without these but the other pose apps are pushing these extra options."
"6115",836767708,"I love love love Wayfair. I've been purchasing items for my home for years now in this site. Yes some items are expensive, but it's all worth it because the quality is spectacular. I never experienced any issues with shipping, ordering, or customer service. I definitely recommend this company for everything in your home."
"6116",836767708,"I worked hard to finish my house on your app and without any warning my 75 items were just gone! I was just on there selecting my lighting. I am so disappointed in Wayfair.  Felicia Holmes"
"6117",836767708,"I enjoyed the ease of searching, to filters and item options.  However it crashed 3times before I could make my selection and place my order."
"6118",837860959,"Fun, Simple and Hours of gameplay."
"6119",837860959,"Fun nerdy transport/design/sim game. Quite a few levels that are still challenging."
"6120",837860959,"Highly addictive super fun if you’re into trains"
"6121",838455884,"I really do but I wish you don’t fall when you walk or turn and I want these characters to have Faces so please update those 2 things I said please please update please please"
"6122",838455884,"It’s so bad. Waste of money. Every time you move an inch you fall over. You can’t do anything you just sit there and wait to fall"
"6123",838455884,"Pls update the game again"
"6124",838500730,"I’ve always loved the show!!!....and I really love this game...it’s rightfully addicting and it’s honestly very fun..."
"6125",838500730,"downloaded this game yesterday. i played for an hour and this game crashed every five minutes on the dot. it wouldn’t save much of my progress before crashing so i always had to start over.  besides the crashing, this game is insane. to complete a quest i have to wait 4 to 8 hours. keep in mind, i’ve only been playing for an hour. shouldn’t i still be doing 10 - 30 minute quest?  the thing that really made me decide to uninstall was the fact that the developers don’t care about the quality of the game anymore. the last time i saw them reply to one of these comments was a year ago. if they don’t care about their game then why should i?  i recommend downloading the ‘Simpsons tapped out’ game instead. unlike family guy, the Simpsons developers still care about the quality of their game."
"6126",838500730,"Who actually plays this anymore? People who probably can afford to spend $50. an event. So now you have a quick event(5th anniversary-part 5). What that means is to spend money quickly, because it’s impossible to get both characters without doing so. And even so, you would have to spend clams to speed it up, because they only give you a few chances to watch ad’s before it stops letting you. The underwear rack for 199 clams is a ripoff, it only gives you 2-4 underwear’s every 12 hours! You need 40 for one item, and 60 for another. That basically saying, they only allows you to get one at a time, that would take more than the 5-6 days of the quick event to complete it."
"6127",838848566,"Worst design ever for Zenly, I really don’t think it supposed to be as a clean UI like this"
"6128",838848566,"Like how precise it can b but it can suddenly put u 2 miles away in the middle of a field"

"6131",839210443,"This the second time I’ve played this game and still really love it but I would love it even more if you finished making it.  Please please finish the game  Ps. I’ve tried the second one but this one is still better"
"6132",839210443,"I love the game! It is very fun entertaining and you look forward to finish everything! The only problem I have is most of the time when I get off the game it won’t save my progress 😭... other than that I am very happy and satisfied with the work put into the game."
"6133",839301889,"Jupiter Jump is a masterpiece of modern entertainment. I have sunk hours and hours into jumping through these green gates, and I don’t regret a second of it. If you are looking for a game that will take up your time in the best way possible, then you have come to the right place."
"6134",839301889,"This is an amazing app! I look forward to possible new updates. (No, people, the fact that it is obviously not jupiter DOES NOT BOTHER ME. I don’t know why it bothers you!)"
"6135",839301889,"It's so exsiding!😃but also not fun when you lose. 😕but I really think it's a good game👍"
"6136",839599050,"This game is absolutely amazing! When im in the duck blinds or in a deer stand this game definitely passes time when nothing is happening!"
"6137",839599050,"Congrats you throw ads faster than YouTube or the tv"
"6138",839599050,"i was at 200k per swipe with everything bet high at price and the game literally reset!! it put me back at $1. Is this apart of the game or something?! It took so long for me to get there!!!!!"
"6139",839897809,"Honestly way better than most high school teachers. They know what they’re doing. This app has helped me in math so much"
"6140",839897809,"This app really has helped me with my struggle! I’m no math whizz and probably might not be for the next couple years, but I’ll be able to understand certain things since the tutors are kind, supportive, and positive throughout!"
"6141",839897809,"I am a student and tutor myself. I have struggled with the current math I am in and catching up to my class. So when my dad found this app I was relieved. The tutors give me the confidence to attempt work on the classroom. I am very pleased with my experiences so far! Definitely would recommend!"
"6142",840146800,"The game is ok it’s can be very hard and sometimes it will freeze or exit of the game but it is a decent"
"6143",840146800,"Wars"
"6144",840146800,"Its so entertaining and enjoyable. I definitely recommend this game!!"
"6145",840469989,"Sure is a disappointment that the devs have abandoned this game."
"6146",840469989,"Was worth every penny :-)"
"6147",840469989,"Excitante y Stresante juego aunque no dejo de jugarlo 😜😜😜"
"6148",840811083,"This games seems interesting, and it is, for five minutes, after which it gets very boring. This is certainly not worth three dollars, I would criticize its lack of content if it was free."
"6149",840811083,"This game is a must buy. I wonder if they would make a second game soon it's that good."
"6150",840811083,"Got bored in about 10 minutes. I enjoy the concept and I think the app was made well but I don't think it's worth $2.99 when there really isn't room for further content.   I also hate the timed feature. It makes it less a puzzle and more of a speed test. You're not really thinking about it as much as having quick reflexes and hope for the best.  If it was not timed or offered a timeless feature I'd enjoy it more, but still doubt that I'd play it more than an hour or 2.   In its defense I was hoping it'd be a bit more closer to Einstein's 5 houses riddle so maybe I just disappointed myself when it wasn't along those lines as much as I'd hoped."
"6151",840919914,"I hate it I won’t even let me play, if I could give it zero stars I def would!"
"6152",840919914,"It keeps on crashing"
"6153",840919914,"Great game. Should be 5 stars. But the ads are so unfairly invasive. The game will start and mid-swipe an ad pops up and tricks your thumb into clicking on it. Then the Audio ads start and illuminates my office with embarrassing noise. Can I please pay money for an ad free version? This is just awful and unplayable. Every time an audio ad pops up, I’ll add to this scathing review. One popped up"
"6154",841098932,"This game is amazing"
"6155",841098932,"Love the game it’s amazing very enjoyable."
"6156",841098932,"Am I blind or is there no way to redeem codes on iOS?! The store page says we can, but I can’t find any in app. I had to go to my Android device (thankfully I still have it!) in order to redeem some new codes. What is going on?"
"6157",841118013,"I loved this app when I first downloaded it but now when I watch a show it stops and says show unavailable. Please fix these problems!"
"6158",841118013,"It keep stopping saying the video have no right due to date. I can’t watch anything"
"6159",841118013,"Something I just don’t understand about this app. I can watch BET through my cables app, but I don’t see my provider listed in this app."

"6164",842503500,"There customer service is amazing. They where there to help me and they responded right away. my favorite clothing website."
"6165",842503500,"- Can't see previous order details in app - No customer reviews - No free returns - No ""buy the look"" option for           coordinating/matching items - Needs better filtering for searches - Wishlist items don't stay with account. For      example, I deleted and reinstalled the app       because of a technical issue. Logged     back in and all of my saved items were        lost."
"6166",842617644,"I have played a lot of 1942/Strikers type games, but This one is one of the best!! I mean, WOW!  Stunning Graphics, great music, and easy movement control. I also enjoy the fact that once purchased, there are no in app extra purchases. It’s all there. The whole game. Now, you have to play to earn in game coins to upgrade your fighters, but to me, that’s the fun in it. Very well made game. I will have this on my phone for a good long time!"
"6167",842617644,"Amazing amount of content and depth for the price tag...if you are even just a causal fan of shooters like this...pick it up!!"
"6168",842617644,"The developers certainly did a nice job with this, but it is beyond limited. There are only a bunch of levels that you’ll complete very quickly and it ends with a message that the game is over and you can except challenges to play with others. The only thing is NO ONE IS THERE TO PLAY A CHALLENGE WITH!    This is not what I expected or what I paid for. I wish this was not the case.  Apple needs to REMOVE THIS APP FROM THE APP STORE and I would like a REFUND MY MONEY."
"6169",842842640,"It’s actually rly good and I used to use it to make little stories and tbh I’m pretty good at it so thanks for being here so I don’t have to use a flash drive"

"6178",845918296,"When my IPad’s disconnected from the internet I can’t play roblox I play this game :)"
"6179",845918296,"I really really love this game but the problem is the age rating it took me a long time for me to convince my dad to try it out but when he did the only thing that was in there was violence no crude humor or any of the really bad stuff it says about it I think the age limit should be lower"
"6180",845918296,"This game is very fun and I am still playing. I have ideas the first idea is if you lose zombies you could watch an ad and get em back. Second idea if you get a free zombie it could have a chance it could be armored and it could have goodies in the armor. Last idea if you get a free zombie you could have a chance it could be the platinum zombie. That’s my ideas I hope they get used"

"6192",847347016,"差劲"
"6193",847492141,"Please it will be so much better if you upgrade the game quickly instead of waiting for a long time. Thank you!!"
"6194",847492141,"At season 7 you can transfer from Tottenham to a “bigger” club like Manchester United. So yeah, traveling back in time 10 years was a big twist for me."
"6195",847492141,"I played this game and the goalie is way to fast I shoot it in the top corner and he saves it. Also it is really frustrating when the players don’t go for the ball or when a defender jumps up in the air and the other player won’t jump. And is it me or do your hearts go down way to fast it like I have a full set of hearts 10 minutes of playing they are gone"
"6196",847985808,"So I love this game. But I have one problem with it. Not enough to do. You attack, train troops, attack again, train more troops... it just keeps going. Any ideas for more to do? Maybe some kind of space battle element? One other thing. In squads, there should be some kind of co leader position so that the leader isn’t the only one who can promote."
"6197",847985808,"I’ve just started plying the gem again and when i was checking the upgrade time to get to hq lvl 4 is said 1d I suggest having the top upgrade time and or research and training to take 5 hours or less if these upgrade times weren’t so long I would have gave it five stars"
"6198",847985808,"I have played Star Wars commander for a long time 2years in fact and I just want to say that it is awesome."
"6199",848160327,"It gives me add right after I hit continue and it ends the run fix that"
"6200",848160327,"More settings on the app other than that five star rating"

"6203",848218959,"I just got it but I play it on my friend’s phone and I love it it’s so fun and just a good game for when your bored and have no internet like in the car or in line somewhere it is challenging but I think that’s what makes it such a good game and you do get better with practice like other games"
"6204",848218959,"I know a lot of the other reviews said their were too many adds, but for me their are none! The game is absolutely perfect! Except for one thing. Why have levels? You already have points."
"6205",848276233,"this app is just terrible how do you even move around on the map where do you know where he is i mean all you do is tap him and it makes noises this is so stupid waste of my money #REFUND!"
"6206",848276233,"Terrible. Want money back"
"6207",848276233,"Horrible app Just hops around endlessly and lands on your location every few hops. Give me back my money I was just trying to make my kid happy"
"6208",848515450,"Great graphics, gameplay. The best thing thing about it is it's simplicity."
"6209",848515450,"Alone is very intense at most points, and has awesome graphics. It has very good music, especially in the credits. I would highly recommend this game to people that like intense gaming, and I have not seen any problem with it"
"6210",848515450,"I simply love this game. Still one of my favorites on iOS."
"6211",849095637,"I used to love this game and I wanted to play it again, but the controls make it impossible to play. I'll try to jump and it's like Thomas sticks and hits an invisible wall. It's too frustrating to play if you can't play it properly. I'm sad, this game is great with functioning controls. :( Also, screen formatting is super weird on the iPhone X, but I can't find any way to change it."
"6212",849095637,"Wow! I want it on all devices now! The game is great because the quality is very good and the levels and the story are well made!  And I can’t believe it took only 3 people to make this AMAZING game!  I’m a big fan of Thomas Was Alone!"
"6213",849095637,"This is one of the best games that I’ve played in a while. I love the minimalist graphics and narration; I think that this game speaks to the storytelling capabilities of games. This game is definitely worth more than the $5 it costs."
"6214",849145835,"1.I have to pay to view projects 2.I have to pay to save my projects 3.I don’t like the tool format 4.please make pro version instead of having to pay to edit 5.It would be better if there were ads instead of having to pay to edit  😡🤬🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"
"6215",849145835,"I was a casual user of app.... Liked it ... Today an iPad update failed , tried many times ..... Deleted app and reloaded. Now I can't past a option selection page to Union Pro.... On line reviews say basic cost 1.99, app store says it's free !? Are my now forced to go through a Union Pro option ? I just want what I had before ... The basics ?"
"6216",849145835,"What happened to this app since when is it subscription based???used to be free, this some BS.  Cancelled"
"6217",849732663,"This app was really good before the new version that does not work at all home phone or any Apple product I’m very distressed wood with this product now I would night but is anybody to purchase a waste their money on this app"
"6218",849732663,"This app does with most only promise to do but never deliver.  It is a key tool in my every day work flow.  It is worth the time and effort to learn how it works and how to best use it so that it fits into your daily flow.     Give it a try, you won’t be sorry and I’m sure you’ll love it as much if not more than I do, if that’s possible.  tollebooth"
"6219",849732663,"Decent product. But it’s a little too expensive right now. There’s other products available that are much cheaper and run better. But it does do a decent job."
"6220",849796318,"I love this game but I finished it in a day... At school..."
"6221",849796318,"This game could have been fun if it kept going. But to spend buck and get 35 minutes of play time, it just isn't worth it.   It is just a cash grab."
"6222",849796318,"I loved this game to death but it ended after a few hours i think you should make more level"
"6223",850417475,"I am playing"
"6224",850417475,"The majority of the time, this game is enjoyable.  I like how there are several ways to earn powerups throughout. However, I don’t appreciate the game deciding that I want to use the lollipop hammer and boom it just uses it for me.  I go to make a move and there it is in play.  I didn’t want that!  Maybe ask before putting in play “Do you want to use this powerup?” Just like you do when I quit the game. “Are you sure?” Which is annoying as all get out!  Yes I clicked quit for a reason.  I am angry about this.  I work at earning those silly powerups because I will not spend money on any of my games.  Nope!  So it’s frustrating that y’all decide for me when to use them.  I’d give one star but I do like the option of videos to earn powerups and moves. ***The game keeps asking if I want to sign in Facebook so that they can share MY information.  That is unacceptable! I’m already logged in to keep my progress stored.  There is no reason they need to share my info.  I may be uninstalling this app."
"6225",850417475,"Update to this review: September 19 Your in game apps are double charging people. I made a single 3.99 purchase on 8/18. I received a bill for 2 purchases of 3.99. I have reported this to the apple store. Fix your game.  I really loved this game and played it every day. I loved the quests and the daily spins. Now it is impossible to earn rewards. You recently put in the ability to watch ads to earn boosters and/or gain lives. I was ready to stay with the game because I could finally win levels. Suddenly those are gone. I still hate the Mr. Toffee game. My best hope to clear a board is when the other players either actively participate or ignore the board. For days now another player has blocked my path. You have ruined a great game. Return the challenges and nix the Mr. Toffee."
"6226",850417796,"Ditto comments of the other reviewer."
"6227",850417796,"App does not open maybe a SCAM for you to keep hit buy botton."
"6228",850417796,"After using the free version for awhile I thought I’d take the plunge and use the full version to help me plan for future farm goals. They took my money and launched me into a never ending circle of checking my subscription. The app doesn’t give me access to the info and when I click to buy the subscription it says I’ve already bought. It never finishes when I click restore subscription. So, apparently you have my money, but I don’t have what I paid for."
"6229",852152318,"I just don’t know how to get my glasses off and then I’m on the app!"
"6230",852152318,"Paid $2 to remove ads but they keep coming back. Tried to restore purchases and buy it again (says I already own it).   Using guided access, the ads are not clickable and forces us to exit guided access and close the app.   In app purchases for hints seems like a pure money grab"

"6239",852250176,"Everything about this game is amazing. I've been playing it for years and the soundtrack is exquisite. 10/10 would rate again."
"6240",852250176,"I've played this game on a computer before, and I have to say, it was very fun. I looked to see if it was on the App Store, and I was glad when I saw that it was, but when I went to enter the app, it kicked me out! Could you please fix this bug?"
"6241",852555131,"I love recording affirmations with background music; it really uplift the spirit. But I am very visual, so decided to type out affirmations as a photograph, and then add other beautiful photographs to this to make a video. Since this is the first time I have used adobe spark video, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could not only visually see my text of the affirmations, but could record them in my own voice, was lovely music in the background. Oh JOY!! Thank you for creating this app to help me create a beautiful life!"

"6247",852912420,"Is a good game all in all, however my account got hacked because of my yahoo email account and now I can’t even access to it, is there a way in which I can possibly access to that account without the email? Or is it possible for me to transfer that account to another email without using my Facebook account, it was linked to it but it asked me for an email so I wonder if there is a possibility to recover that account. I will be waiting for your response."
"6248",852912420,"Solid well thought through game. Not stingy like many these days."
"6249",852912420,"Picked up the game to see about the Vampire Lord now I can’t stop playing"
"6250",853246110,"As other reviewers have suggested, this game is poorly balanced. I don’t have a problem with the AI, because I think it would be easier to beat if the game were designed better. The biggest problem seems to be the suspect cards that give Jack extra sandglasses, which prematurely ends the game. The detectives have 6 turns to find Jack, but if he picks up a card that gives him 2 sandglasses on the first turn and another that also gives him 2 sandglasses on the second turn, that’s game over. That’s not the AI being clever—I can win in 2 turns doing that if I’m playing as Jack, too! Playing as Jack on any difficulty is way easier than playing as Sherlock on the easiest setting. It’s no fun when your AI opponent has the game mechanics working in their favor and you never get the full 6 turns to do your best. The suspect cards should be reworked or just removed entirely."
"6251",853246110,"I read this comment above several times before downloading and I couldn’t agree more. Solid game, definitely a good puzzle, but I think it would receive a 5th star from me if I had the ability to “undo” and go back to select a different action if I change my mind once I select the action I’m gonna do."
"6252",853246110,"Fun game, but is unstable with latest iOS."
"6253",853706620,"What game are you guys playing? This is terrible. It won’t do anything and there is no explanation of what in the world the game is about. I hate that I paid for nothing. Would be nice if the game actually did something. First board and nothing happens no matter where I tap. I want a refund!"
"6254",853706620,"Another one of these extremely incomprehensible games with too much animation, zero logic & designed merely to frustrate The player into complete madness ! Every game should start off insanely easy to give The player The encouragement to continue to The levels where playing actually begins, instead of immediately urging them to quit. $10 already forgotten, deleting this monstrosity right now!"
"6255",853706620,"It’s a good game!"
"6256",853834250,"A silly game of chance that, despite having ads before every level (and sometimes after), has a lives limit and charges outrageous rates for power ups.   Keep hunting for that whale."
"6257",853834250,"This is Peggle, but with EA's grimy hands all over the product. As a Peggle lover from the Pop Cap only days, I was excited to have Peggle on my phone to play anywhere I wanted, and for a while overlooked the Candy Crush like elements of the mobile version.  I un-installed at level 38. I had been trying to beat this level for a day, and had to wait for my lives to restock to try again. Three lives in, and I finally cleared every orange peg. Excited to move onto the next level, the game had informed me I failed because I didn't score enough points.  That isn't only ""difficulty for difficulty's sake"", which I can handle because it makes the eventual victory sweeter, but when you combine that with a lives system that encourages me to spend actual money, I'm out. I not only have to clear orange pegs, difficult enough, but now I have to make sure to have enough points too?   Pop Cap made the best small, addicting games and I basically threw money at them to get their gaming version of drugs. Now, with EA, I can't uninstall fast enough."
"6258",853834250,"EA makes really good games. Unfortunately, they are also an unconscionably greedy company."
"6259",853926670,"App is just ok.  Too many cams out of service at one time or another.  Need cams in more countries."
"6260",853926670,"Loving this app! Having fun traveling the world LOL If my weather’s bad here I enjoy sun elsewhere. Snow? Go to Aruba. Just fun, that’s all"
"6261",853926670,"I've downgraded you again to one star,again. Cameras constantly freezing going off-line. Clean your cameras Please.🌫🌫 Worldwide campaign clean earth cam cameras,💧 💦💦💧 Clean your cameras❗️ get rid of the scroll, does nothing but provide useless information."
"6262",854145102,"Best app ever!😆"
"6263",854145102,"Have to close and open the app several times before it'll work."
"6264",854145102,"Doesn't work"
"6265",855274310,"Just downloaded and the video looked like green static. Is there a way to fix this please?"
"6266",855274310,"Used this app since it’s launch bought all filters and this app just doesn’t work, iPhone XS won’t import clips any long when taking video they come out with distorted green lines sad because this was a diamond in the rough"
"6267",855274310,"I use this app a lot. Trying to buy the new Richy filter and it won’t respond!"
"6268",855627886,"This game is amazing and great but it crashes every time I play it. I grinded challenges to get an 87 overall. Now I can’t and I’m a little mad. Please fix this game cause I want to play it. Plzzzzzzzzz!!!!"
"6269",855627886,"Games won’t load bug fixes?"
"6270",855627886,"I love this game because it’s one of the best mobile games that has been made. But can you fix the madden kickoff celebration season please. It allows me to pick this season and my team but then it kicks me completely off the game which is getting frustrating. But I would also love to see a new mode like my career."
"6271",857555369,"This is a FANTASTIC game, and if you've never played it yet, you should most definitely grab it. I snagged the early access version on Steam and WOW! SO. MUCH. HAS. BEEN. ADDED!!! It's almost like a sequel (well, ATM, it's basically a Wayward Souls 1.5)!!!  I REALLY hope your team is able to add all of this new content to the iPhone build. Seeing as how we've all been playing the iPhone version for, what, 5 years now... I'm pretty sure that most all of us have gotten accustomed to the touchscreen controls. Even after playing with a controller on my laptop for over 6 months now, it still doesn't feel EXACTLY right, and I don't think there's anything that could be done to make it so.   Anyway.... if you're an Action RPG fan, or a sucker for sadistically difficult games :;: GET THIS. NOW!!  The touchscreen controls are spot on perfect, and I do believe they have MFi support as well (I don't know, the current version has an OS requirement too high for my iPhone 5, which is the only device that fits in my MOGA controller - so I couldn't tell you).   Out of between 5-10 THOUSAND games (Im too scared to check it out, but I've been using the AppStore for 10 years now, and there were multiple months when I spent close to $1,000) that I've downloaded from the AppStore, this is one of maybe 30 that I have made sure to ALWAYS have available to play on one of my iDevices. It's an iOS classic, and if I wasn't so emotionally attached to Secret of Mana, it'd be my #1 favorite ARPG available.   To the devs:;: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE include your mobile customers when you officially release all of the new content!! Raise the price! I'd very gladly gift this game to quite a few people that share base-reality with me, even if I knew they weren't going to enjoy it. I also have a few very close friends in other countries I would love to share it with on Steam - so once it goes live after it's early access, you can count on me buying them copies as well, regardless of wether or not the new content is brought over to mobile. You all deserve every single sale you get and then some. THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS MAGNIFICENT GAME!"
"6272",857555369,"This game freaking amazing.  It is a crime that it doesn’t get more exposure.  The gameplay is tough at first but as you play you’ll see how finely tuned this game is to much your skills.  And above all, this game has more heart than anything I’ve seen since Shovel Knight."
"6273",857555369,"This is still my favorite game on ios and I Uninstalled it after waiting for years for the ""paladin"" update that never came.  What happened???"
"6274",859204347,"Enjoy"
"6275",859204347,"This game is a true beauty but can we please have like bombing events that happen on the map like since it’s a war game I’d add realism to the battlefield like no people just planes bomb and have the chance to do damage"
"6276",859204347,"This game makes me neglect my responsibilities, but in a good way"

"6282",860011430,"This app is my favorite app of all"
"6283",860454499,"Bad game."
"6284",860454499,"I just have to say, this is a good game overall. But the name has a typo ""Mud Booger"". Great physic and I give it four out of five stars."
"6285",860454499,"You don't even go mudding so why is it called mud bogger? It's a stupid game not worth it. They would have to pay me to play it."
"6286",860620713,"You can’t play on multiplayer mode!!!"
"6287",860620713,"Touch sensitivity is off. Pretty much a waste of time"
"6288",860620713,"It not hard at all a pre schooler can beat every body on this game!"
"6289",860822992,"I love this game sooooooo much I tune into this game everyday it’s so amazing. I have been playing this game for a couple of years and I have come so far. I remember not having barely anything now I have everything I ever wanted in the game 2 cars, 9 houses, 3 working places and more. You can’t think so small minded save and spend at the same time it’s so fun, and I have never at all bought K-stars,money, or energy. Just to see how much I’ve improved in the game is amazing you just have to do lots and stay focused. Like when you have the show your style events participate in those they are so fun and a good way to get a bunch of K-stars. I just really love this game and if you are thinking about getting it you better because you don’t want to miss a second of this amazing game."
"6290",860822992,"I would if I could like everyone else who is dissatisfied with a product give this game a zero star but sadly I can’t. I used to think highly of this game but now my opinion has changed due to poor customer service. I’ve been paying for a Bronze VIP membership for about nine months now and never had any problems until the new update. Recently I haven’t been receiving all of my k-stars in the daily gift box and of course I brought the problem to Glu support. I told them that if they didn’t fix the situation I’d threaten to cancel my membership but that didn’t fix my situation. I spoke to two different people over the course of four days to have the first person tell me to make a new complaint ticket and the second person ask me twice if I was still not receiving the k-stars and how long had this problem been going on. I hate to say this but I had a feeling I knew it was going to be a waste of time. Glu games you just lost a customer."
"6291",860822992,"Classy.  Anyway, what’s going on with the Now Kollection consists of what I’m already wearing, and when I navigate to it, I wind up at a blank page I can’t close, or it just crashes the app? This has gone untreated for two days or more.  More universal concerns: no reliable way to change operating systems. As everyone reading this is likely aware, iOS goes through periods of being enraging or unusable. Since this game also exists on Android, I don’t understand why I can’t play the same account on Android sometimes while iOS has one of those several-month-long user-hostility tantrums. Maybe fix this right away too.  Not as important to me because I’m dull and basic: only two genders and only one body type for each. Disappointing in 2018 (UPDATE: it’s now mid-2019 and the closest thing to a solution is that some of the dresses for female characters falsely simulate the gentle hint of modest curves) especially when female characters can have the same clothes as (voluptuous and body-positive) Kim Kardashian but have to remain stick-thin no matter what. Strange comparison to incessantly bludgeon the user with.  UPDATE: The UX has somehow found a way to be MORE of a nightmare? If you’re a loyal player like I am, you probably have a lot of clothes and accessories. When taking part in contests like Show Your Style, it would be nice to have a few quality-of-life improvements to make organization a lot easier (read: it is essential that drastic changes be made immediately). There used to be a grey tag on clothes that you had just submitted that let you know at a glance what you would have to wait a couple days to use again. That tag has been missing from the past two Show Your Style contests. The tag is not enough to keep navigating the vast and cumbersome sufficiently user-friendly, but removing it was a stupid mistake and it needs to come back before I log back into the game in a few minutes. Also, an undo button cannot be implemented quickly enough (refer to imvu to see how it’s done), because as you navigate, the game misinterprets a TON of touch screen dragging as taps. Also, Accessories and Miscellany absolutely must, as soon as possible, be further subdivided into earrings, necklaces, rings, left wrist, right wrist, et cetera. Lastly (FOR NOW), let’s have one of those elevator thingies on the side of long, scrolling menus, that let you easily tell how far down a too-long list you’ve navigated. Like... every app with a long list of characters or cards or whatever has one of these things. Microsoft Word has utilized this feature for decades and the fact that the Kardashian game doesn’t have one is felt like a gunshot in your shoulder.  So fix these mistakes like quick. Like literally before tomorrow. Then we can talk about other no-brainer quality-of-life necessities this game has somehow SURVIVED FIVE YEARS without providing.  (To be clear, nobody should be taking part in Show Your Style until the UX is fixed. I know I won’t, and I also know that I’ve spent quite a bit of money to take part in Show Your Style, so I genuinely hope that a good boycott acts as a game-fixing gadfly to these greedy developers.)  UPDATE: Need more of a warning that there’s a special event on than a vague, solitary, and missable push notification that merely mentioned that Fashion Week is happening. Also I’m pretty sure that the push came hours after the event had started. Why not let us know a few days in advance that an event is coming up? Or, like the games that are doing this right are doing, a week or more in advance?"
"6292",861891048,"I used to use this app until it became so ridiculous, offering things that I don’t need, trying to force you to upgrade to VIP by removing more features, fake profiles are everywhere in this app even you can get banned by anyone who can report you without you doing anything wrong, it’s just getting so annoying and becoming a horrible experience."
"6293",861891048,"All my friends found love on this. Not me. This is why I’m giving it one star."
"6294",861891048,"Do not download!  I have had this app for 6 months now. Didn’t use it a lot until this last week. More spam and fake accounts than real ones. Yes some are real but a lot of fake accounts. They want me to invest in bitcoin or download Skype to extort you.  My favorite yet they add you and say nothing."
"6295",862303071,"I played this for quite awhile and suddenly it started all over then I tried to start to play it several times again and it kept starting back at the beginning again... I really enjoyed it while it was working. I sent messages but no response."

"6308",863960527,"This game is awesome! Our family loves playing together and having big tournaments. I’m giving a low star review, hoping that the developers will see it and fix the horrible glitch issue that keeps happening. Or at least give us a way to save tournament progress, so that when the game freezes and we have to close and restart the app the tournament can keep going.  I agree this game does NOT need online player. The whole point is to bring people together to play. There are plenty of online player games."

"6315",864130829,"In terms of format this is not the best laid out app. However, it serves its purpose and is a good review. Some of the questions were actually used in the real keystone test. If the application had better formatting/options it would deserve a five star."

"6320",865958296,"Everything about this game is fun; the individual fight styles, the stages, the avatars as well as the sales for IAP. The game is easily grindable (not a word lol) and if you play enough, you can level easily. That is until you hit the 50’s. However, I think it would be fun to add a story mode to each character to play through. A side mission of course. Doesn’t have to be long, just a bonus for Awakening the character. Also, add speed options when auto continue is on, like they have in Brave Frontier. That would be really helpful. I’ve managed to awaken 3 characters in a short period of time. And show support with the awesome karate sales!!!!! 감사합니다!!!!!"
"6321",865958296,"The most sexist geme I’ve ever seen, I won't even complain about the clothes because this is already a recurring thing in games, but these lines like ""i'm ready for a man"", among others, srly. The game is kinda cool but these things were unneeded and so past century."

The program has a lot of power but is easy to use and is always being improved.  I have tried a few other apps such as MindNode, MindMaple and SimpleMind but really liked how iThoughts worked.  I go between my Mac and iPad a lot and having my files synch across them works great.  You will be amazed at all the uses you’ll find for this app."
"6327",866786833,"I’ve used now for a few months. Works great. No issues. Interoperability between iphone and iPad is vital to me and works fine. I’m shortly going to buy the PC version so that I can work on projects on desktop & laptop."

I even asked for technical support but nothing has changed they usually ask which game do you want to login to but for some reason I have not had that luck as of yet and I feel stressed about it...!!! I miss my hard levels I don’t want to start all over... and suggestions PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME !!! Don’t remember the numbers but the name is the same 😭"

I would really love to keep playing this app game."
"6340",868013618,"So you should get this game because it is free and does not need internet connection only for one thing but you can still play the game and you get cute cool characters to and your goal is to defend the slug and there is more but you are going to have to get best fiends to find out what they are"
"6341",868013618,"Very addicting and so fun. I like that it’s different. The characters are fun. I just wish they had more sound effects from the characters. That’s the only thing I can think of to change.  Give it a whirl..you’ll probably like it! 😉"

"6343",868123351,"dis game neds 2 git gud seriously, i've mastered its engine but add penalty kicks and make it easier to score a goal, my nephew is raging because its hard to score the goal, fix plz lel"
"6344",868123351,"Fun game but hard to score a goal. I think penalty kicks should be added to make the game not so repetitive because if there aren't penalty kicks then the golden goal period keeps going on and I highly suggest adding penalty kicks"
"6345",868123351,"The game is fun to play, but the system is a bit whack. You pretty much can't score a goal point blank.  The only goals I can score so far out of three matches are rebound goals, where you put the ball in the net after the goalie has blocked it."

It was free when I got it, so I didn’t spend a lot to be done so soon. Some of these puzzle apps can go on for hours.  It’s not booked as a super hard puzzle, just another fun part of the series. Slight mental gymnastics, but good for a wind down puzzle before bed or after a meeting.  Island and fort additions are much appreciated for gameplay! As promised, 4 stars goes up to 5"
"6353",869011374,"Here’s what I got out of this game more than anything else:  Dozens and dozens times this message interrupted my playing:  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map” (for a payment, of course).   So in cases anyone missed it, here it is a few more times:  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  “A new fast travel location has been added to the map.”  Etc., etc., etc."

This game is fantastic and can show yourself who you are as the main character is not dignified. I have played this game over and over, while it’s not a long game, it’s one that stays with you."

I love puzzle games and to find out in the end that my choices actually affected the outcome, I was pleasantly surprised!! I plan to tell anyone who’s willing to listen about this game!! Thank you so much developers for the awesome experience that you so wonderfully provided!! Please make more games! PLEASE!!!"
"6363",869869881,"This was a very interesting point click adventure. It is not a difficult as some other click point adventures as I have done but the storyline was more interesting and deep. The art is very good. If you are more engaged by the story around the mystery and not so much the difficulty of puzzles this is an exceptional game."
"6364",870099476,"App dễ dùng và tiện lợi"
"6365",870099476,"The app transferred everything successfully, 5/5 stars for that. The problem is that I can’t leave bc I don’t have a home button on the iphone xr. Please help."
"6366",870099476,"This so does what it promises. I just spent two hours at the phone store trying to transfer my data and they could not. I saw some people had trouble using this app, and I don’t know why. I put the app on both phones and it did all the work. If I could rate you a 10, I would. I will tell anyone and everyone to use this app. I am a fan. And this from a person that is not a computer person. Don’t fall for the bad reviews. My 6 year old grandson could transfer files with this app"
"6367",870322730,"Best game ever graphics are unbelievable gameplay awesome as hell, need to make a part 2 with more choices played this game twice and still not boring amazing I tell u amazing"
"6368",870322730,"I had to go back and write a review simply because even after years of this game’s release, i have not found a game in the app store as satisfying. I pray for a sequel and keep searching for games similar or related to Implosion. I’m going to re download for another playthrough."
"6369",870322730,"This is worth it so I am writing a review it has a good storyline but the defend mode is way to hard I get as sweaty as a football player when I get to those rounds please make the game a little bit easier thanks you"

"6374",871197819,"At some points during game play the games music will stop. Please fix this"
"6375",871197819,"The very simplistic art style combined with the relaxing music adds an element thats essential to indie runner games. Very nice"
"6376",871230822,"I wasted 4 dollars thinking you could have fun when you get there but no you just hold a button see a picture then do it again"
"6377",871230822,"I love it! Can you just update it more ? Like add new places, new cars, items, clothing, And not only be the cat but also be foxes,wolves,tigers,ETC. And places besides car wash and gas. Like food places, rest stops, and the gas station have like that inside part with food and whatever, it would be awesome to add that stuff, also police, signs like yeld, stop, keep left,ETC. That’d be awesome! I’m a bored ten year old like others on here, but I haven’t played this game in years! Well I’m actually 9 but almost ten.. i also know how to program which is insanely complex for my age.. but those changes would be awesome!"

"6379",871694174,"I love toca boca but could you at least try and make some of your apps free. Not everybody is able to pay for the apps."
"6380",871694174,"Hi! I love this game and thanks for making it free! I wish that more awesome Toca life games were free also. I realize that this is your way of making money, but I wish that they were free!        Thanks!"
"6381",871694174,"So I’ve bought nearly all of the Toca life apps and I’m very impressed. I love playing doll house type games on my phone, and Toca has made the best games as far as I can tell. I got Toca life: world, and it’s the best idea, to combine all of the apps into one. But, then I went to the police station and it’s still the same old police station from this app. I think it needs a remodel, or maybe a new, larger police station in Toca world. Like maybe more prison cells, and possibly a cell that has an escape tunnel in it. Also maybe more officers and more colorful, crazy criminals. In another play house app, players could wash and design the police car, then take it out for a spin and capture a criminal. THAT WOULD BE SOOO COOL. I was also thinking you could create a fire department, and a house that caught on fire so kids could then rescue people from the building and put out the fire. And maybe the classic cat in a tree could be in that app too. I hope you take a look at these suggestions, cuz I’ve been thinking bout them for a lonnnggg time. THANKS, bye."
"6382",871809581,"This. game. Is. Great. And when it freezes when you die, it makes great wallpaper."
"6383",871809581,"This is just treedude from super hot"
"6384",871809581,"I love this game but now I don’t play it anymore because you’re made to watch an ad before every single replay attempt. I spend more time watching ads than playing the game and it’s just not even worth it anymore. Maybe if they did an ad every 5 games or so it wouldn’t be so obnoxious?"
"6385",872424895,"I remember a vid of an early version of this game where the rx7 rotary went brap brap brap but when I downloaded the game is sounded nothing like I expected which kinda made me like the game less but here is a suggestion of a car u should add it’s a green rx3 call MUTANT"
"6386",872424895,"After few last updates the isnt work , idk why... sometimes im starting to ride and its just lagged and off , sometimes i cant open the game... Now after last update i cant play. I have 8+ , thats too potato phone for your game? or what? pls fix this game. I love this game so much..."
"6387",872424895,"Lol gay"
"6388",873008064,"This would be great for presentations if it had an auto restart -- when countdown hits zero, vibrate 2 times then restart the counter. Useful for other activities, like gym, where you want to move from task to task. Would also be nice if it could set time in seconds. Add those 2 features and I'd give it 5 stars."
"6389",873008064,"Lousy item to sell to anybody."
"6390",873008064,"Really lousy. No alarm when iPhone screen is off. Cannot set up more than one alarm time. I regret deeply to make this purchase. Don't waste your money like me. What a disappointment!"
"6391",873474116,"‭137 1809 4242‬ This is the number of a horrible delivery guy in for Edaixi in Beijing. He should be fired with no doubt. Yelling at the customer is a norm whenever he comes in to pick up or drop off the laundry.   I don’t know how the app manage their offline service. But this certainly should not be the case."
"6392",873474116,"Great service， though not very speedy at peak season. Cleaned really old stain on my ugg completely."
"6393",873474116,"Takes 7 days to get your clothes back"
"6394",874845056,"I was able to play it fine on the 8 but is unplayable on the XR. The game crashes when you try to no anything"
"6395",874845056,"The game is great. The graphics are fantastic. But I personally think you guys should make ones with bike and scooters and add whole skate parks like Woodward skaters edge"
"6396",874845056,"This is the best mobile skate game out hands down. It’s the most control over the board once you figure it out. But my only qualm is, why aren’t they continuing with this and making more levels. The levels they have are cool, but that’s it. There’s no further to go. I feel like they could be capitalizing on this app big time. But maybe the creators have moved on."
"6397",875063456,"This app is so great. It has helped me so much and I just got it! The rewards and cool graphics really add to the learning experience and makes me want to play more."
"6398",875063456,"I love this game and find it extremely helpful!  That said, I would love if we could have an option to have the daily training session be more than five games; it doesn’t seem like a hard thing to implement at all."
"6399",875063456,"This app is invigorating! Sharpens the mind but does not dull the blade with an exuberant amount of work. Purchasing the app has increased my desire to do more than the daily exercises to practice areas I need strength!"
"6400",875152413,"I am baffled why more calculators are not this simple. The interface is clean and the tape is much appreciated. Worth the price."
"6401",875152413,"only concern is no developer activity since 2014 October when I first installed."

"6405",875224191,"Its been a great app for my kids and I would recommend it for parents who wants to give their kids a headstart in early reading. However, after upgrading to iOS 10.3 today, I got an alert on the screen that this app would stop working with the next iOS upadate if the developers don't upgrade this app. So, I would request the app developers to kindly upgrade this useful app."
"6406",875242534,"Poop"
"6407",875242534,"Although 3.99 isn’t a lot, it’s too much for an app that has 10 minutes of activities"
"6408",875242534,"We have a good time get this game"
"6409",875267105,"This app is cool it help me learn math"
"6410",875267105,"My 6 year old son made it all the way through this game/learning tool to the end.  These games actually taught him math and made it fun.  This game is a geometry game, teaching shapes, angles, and some rules regarding certain shapes and angles and parallel lines.  I wish there were more levels or more games!"
"6411",875267105,"I SMELL PENNIES"

"6414",875561136,"These are amazing!..keep it up the great work!!"
"6415",876054082,"The app from 5 years ago is still superior to this app.  It seems with every update they remove more and more features.  Now projects don’t update throughout the game.  The app looks cooler, it just doesn’t have near the features of its competitors."
"6416",876054082,"I see what they tried to do with the NEW UPDATE, create a fantasy/fun looking app while also being as INFORMATIONAL as possible but its so TRASH.  It moves SLOWER THAN ANY OTHER APP ON MY PHONE. TOUCH REGISTRATION is SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED. and FUNCTIONALITY MAKES NO SENSE (ex: why cant i make a 2 for 1 trade and decide who im dropping, to make space for the two players, all on the same screen? And why does it not automatically update scores while im playing someone? I constantly have to refresh to get the new score)  If NOTHING GETS BETTER between now and end of season, I’ll switch to ESPN app or SLEEPER app."
"6417",876054082,"I don’t know why but I was never able to draft a team from this app. I click on the draft team on the top screen and nothing happens."

"6423",876336838,"好👌"
"6424",876510541,"Our five year old loves this app, we do too! I've been impressed with his increased skill set in a short amount of time. The way the app has an adventure feel to the puzzles keeps him engaged and continues to challenge him. Great product, strongly recommend"
"6425",876510541,"I love this app but it doesn’t pick up the yellow square idk why but please fix it because It’s getting annoying! I put it in the right place but it NEVER picks it up"
"6426",876510541,"My son worked very hard for months solving the puzzles and get his sticker rewards. He loved going through his stickers and seeing what he had. In the update, some ""smart"" person decided to remove the sticker book.  How do you tell your 3 year old all their hard work is lost?"
"6427",876514856,"When playing Osmo Tangram the app continuously directs us to move our pieces to within the boundary.  When we move them the app does not self correct, but stays frozen on the screen.  We have not had this issue in the past.  Please help.  Thank you"
"6428",876514856,"This is a hard and challenging game. If you bought Osmo to help you child with reading, you’ll only find them discouraged. How exactly does yoga result in the word “zen”? How is a seven year old supposed to know what that is?  I’m afraid this game has a pedagogic agenda that I’m not sure I agree with. Additionally, using a brown child vacuuming in the photo for the word “domestic” seems strangely racist."
"6429",876514856,"I was expecting a matching letters level and was initially a little disappointed. However, I see the developer response to this issue so we are excited to try it."
"6430",876520365,"This is the worst app I’ve ever used!!! Every time I want to watch something it says video error has occurred! I have had the app for a while and it has NEVER worked once!!"
"6431",876520365,"Linked my tv provider, but it will not let me watch live tv anymore keeps saying “playback error” really frustrating when keeping up with the Kardashian’s is on."
"6432",876520365,"When I go to watch an full episode I get a video error and to please try again!"
"6433",876524974,"The game is pretty cool but you have to draw very thick lines for it to see the line.👌"
"6434",876524974,"This is a great game for kids and adults to play."
"6435",876524974,"GRRRAAATTT!"
"6436",877831982,"I’ve been playing the game for a while, and, overall, I’ve enjoyed it! Buuuuuut, the battling system is WHACK. I’m not sure how it is further in the game, but my level 10 lost to a level 7! Im preeeetty sure this game is just 90% waiting and lags. I wouldn’t recommend."
"6437",877831982,"THIS GAME IS AWFUL. If you have a crystal unicorn (and this happened to ME!) and you lag out of the server no biggie. BUT I CAME BACK AND MY CREATURE WAS GONE! It glitches out! And everything is so expensive and to change your name its 25 gems! And I only have a few. (3) Every time I get a creature its always common. I have no fares whatsoever. Awful game plz do t get it it only wastes storage"

"6442",878659964,"All it needs is more color and replays"
"6443",878659964,"This game is a mix of puzzles and first person shooting that is very unique. The 12 level update made the game even better and I had to write a review. I am not familiar with the maker but it is a fantastic game and I hope they add more levels!"
"6444",878659964,"I love it, I have had zero problems with this, the levels get more challenging in a very fun way. When I saw the update I was super excited and it made this a worthwhile purchase. Great game!"
"6445",878783582,"So frustrating it is constantly glitching"
"6446",878783582,"Not convenient to have to repeatedly log in to use app. This is horrible for New Yorker’s who want to edit while in the subway on their commute."
"6447",878783582,"I signed up for a free trial of the premium version where I quickly realized the premium options were poorly executed and were options others apps gave you for free. I tried to cancel yet there was no cancel option anywhere in the app. I went to the FAQs which led me to their customer support. I contacted them and asked that they cancel my subscription however they refused to do so and said I had to contact apple billing. It was a total scam."
"6448",879057314,"Getting to the top isn't too hard, but getting out is harder.  It doesn't take too long to learn the moves, but it would be nice if there was a tutorial.  Since it's turn based, this is a good game for filling up some time when you could be interrupted."
"6449",879057314,"The game looks amazing graphically in my opinion, but the game play is just the same thing over and over again. There's no progression really, no unlocking stuff, it's basically just moving around strategically."
"6450",879057314,"An extremely challenging, extremely fun game. I love it! 👍🏻👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️♥️♥️"
"6451",879478102,"Every time I try to open a slideshow the screen just turns black with a loading signal on it and it never loads the slideshow."

"6454",879915134,"too many ads literally every 5 mins i am just trying to watch the show and the ads are all the same and it gets really annoying."
"6455",879915134,"As I mentioned, the app content is top of the line and can’t complain about it, yet the app is horrible, search function is useless and doesn’t work properly... app doesn’t work on all platforms and if you try mirroring your phone; it won’t display in Landscape mode 😔"

I’ve downloaded it deleted it re-downloaded it turn off my phone turned back on tried it on Wi-Fi and LTE it just will not let me get to the campaign or any of the buttons. Which is very sad because I absolutely loved the game recently lost dollars"
"6474",880971164,"Overall great game. Smooth textures, good controls, just amazing feel. I have been a huge fan of assassin's Creed ever since two came out. I love this game I do but I escorted Leonardo Da Vinci to safety got the second challenge for the mission and I was happy then it said connection error. I was connected to WiFi I tried to retry several times and just had to back out of the mission to the Animus. It has happened on a few missions and I do love the game it's just those issues."

"6481",881270303,"When I got this game it was so fun at first then I noticed the operators can't aim at anything you will be 2 feet away from an alien and the your guy aims at the ceiling it makes me so angry when someone gets shot two times and doesn’t die."
"6482",881270303,"I love XCOM but playing on an XR and with the latest iOS, I am finding it buggy to the point of being unplayable. I am on the second mission and have found that I cannot move a solider or get him to do anything. All Moves show up read, none of the weapons will confirm, and when I click to activate my gun, it locks me in a targeting tutorial. I wish I hadn’t spent money on this game. I literally can’t play it."
"6483",881270303,"I was so excited to play this game as I was a huge fan of xcom 2 on my Xbox one but man I can’t even get past the first level after the tutorial because of the buggy controls. My main complaint is the cursor elevation simply does now work. My touch screen doesn’t recognize the command (two fingers swiping or pulling down) and I end up sitting a swiping for 5 minutes trying to get my soldier to either climb up or climb down from his post. It’s really disheartening since I was eager to play it on my new phone and have a genuine console style game that I could play while having downtime offshore."

Not only can I not just take portions of my videos and put them together when I try to “cut” out the parts I don’t want which is a guessing game because it won’t let you preview what your cutting it takes 47 hours to cut it. Completely unusable I’m so mad I spent money on this app like a year ago and now they’ve changed it to something I don’t want."

"6500",882248810,"Although I’m spoiled by “Little Crane”, this is no where close - maybe a 99 cents app.  It’s one-dimensional and somewhat boring.  No big deal. Don’t waste your money."
"6501",882248810,"This is a game for children and adults alike.  From the minute I began playing it, I couldn't put it down.  So many levels with progressive difficulty; yet not difficult enough to make me want to quit. The graphics are excellent, and I really enjoy this physics-based type of game.  It's fun, challenging, and I highly recommend for kids from 5 to 105!  A great departure from all the mindless, thoughtless other stuff that's out there.  Great job!"

"6510",882507985,"Dragon mania legends is the best mobile game I’ve ever played, there’s nothing I would change about it! But I do have an idea for a new feature. You should put in wether. Like, every so often it would rain then clear up after a while. The sky would become grey and maybe some thunder if the player had sound on. But you would also have the option to turn wether off in settings. And the rain would vary from island to island, like the main grassy one would be normal rain, the sand one would have no rain, just grey sky, the swamp/marsh one would be slightly foggy with rain, and polar rock would snow, etc. (sorry I don’t know all the names of the islands) maybe you could also add day and night to, with the option to turn it off, where it would include sunrise and set, day and night. And at night the dragons habitats would slightly light up to produce light. And maybe certain decorations would produce light at night.  I know this all probably won’t happen but if you read it all then thanks! And I hope you like the idea :)"

"6514",883144212,"I really liked this game. For me it somehow had a big realm atmosphere for such a relatively small game, perhaps due to nice music, a smattering of decent sound effects, smooth 3D travel, a quick travel map, great graphics, and a good dose of subtle humor in many of the descriptions (kinda reminded me of some old text adventures). I found the puzzles to be well varied, pretty logical, and mostly intuitive. A couple extra slider puzzles, yes, but didn’t mind them til I got to the end. Honestly, that one was about as much fun as putting together a jigsaw puzzle with the same picture on both sides. Other than that, only got stumped a couple times, but pushed through without the hints and felt pretty satisfied when I finished, except for the lack of closure with the end story. No matter; after all, I wasn’t reading a novel, just playing a short, entertaining puzzle game, and I’m glad I did."
"6515",883144212,"I did not find that there were to many sliding puzzles in this game. I found a diversity of fetching items to unlock doors and mechanical sliding puzzles. There were mazes and other types of puzzles dispersed throughout the games. It was worth a buck and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The last puzzle was an absolute nightmare but it was so satisfying to solve. I recommend this game for puzzle adventure enthusiasts."
"6516",883144212,"It was great to begin with, then I got further into the game and found more and more 'bugs.' I got stuck on the ""26"" puzzle. Finally got to the clue that told me which two numbers to plug in where and found out the clue was wrong after working on the puzzle for quite some time. Ok, fine. Kept going and got to the maze puzzle. Here you had to use the tilt shift of your device to complete the puzzle, and no matter what I did I could not get this to work. The balls absolutely did NOT go in the direction my device was tilted whatsoever. I even tried locking and unlocking the orientation. After trying and ultimately getting annoyed I quit and deleted the game unfinished."

"6524",883393043,"Yea the graphics are cool, but apparently most of the ppl leaving reviews have LOTS of money to spare. This game is absolutely ridiculous how they literally make it impossible to win tournaments unless you spend real money. It takes FOREVER to upgrade cars unless, again, you spend real money. And I love how adding a new part gives you a few extra PR in regular game play, but in tournaments you have to install 2-3 parts just to get ONE more PR. NOTHING BUT A MONEY TRAP!!!"
"6525",883393043,"It’s a slap in the face of NFS fans to call this game “No Limits” when absolutely everything you do it dictated by several currency’s and your  ability or lack there of to earn them.   You need gas.  You need gold.  You need performance points  You need cash!   You need blueprints   You need to wait for this and that..  The gameplay is awesome, but there are many many limitations in this game. What a JOKE."

So I tried making a video without signing in but some of the landscape pictures I put into it, gets pushed to the side so that there’s a black space next to the photo instead of the photo being fully there on the screen. I know this app is awesome and I absolutely love it! It’s just that the recent bugs have been a real bummer and ruining the reputation of this app. So please fix this as soon as possible. Thanks!"

The problem I’m having now that I’m gettin really tired of is even when you kill all the enemies, the next checkpoint won’t clear for you to go through. So you wasted energy and a personal co-op person because of the glitchy missions. I’m the type that doesn’t spend my real money on games so the fact that this game is almost unplayable sometimes is annoying. Also, during raid, when you let your fighter freelance fight, he will be almost finish eliminating all the enemies and then stop and go to attacking the elements of the map. Fix the AI in raid PLEASE. It’s awful and I can’t trust it. Also freelance fighting in trial of elements is buggy because your character constantly wants to try and fight the enemies THROUGH the stairs. Yeah, if you guys could fix all that please, that’d be great."

"6552",886212870,"I knew this game felt familiar. It's exactly like one of their other games I didn't care for, Shiva. Oy. The game plays by itself. It doesn't need you. So much dialog and virtually no play time, unless you think playtime is being instructed of your next clue or location to go to and going there only to be in another pointless dialog for 20 minutes. There is nothing fun here. It's not cutesy, it's not interesting, the female doesn't speak in a way of normal speech flows. You're pointing, you're clicking, you're being led to each next screen and just doing what you're told. Not quite an adventure game. From my perspective it's Shiva in another form and someone will need to sit Shiva for me after this game is over."

By comparison apps like Daz3D (likely used in the design of this app.), and its muscle definition and joint movement has long since passed the model’s capabilities in this app. The models have very unnatural joint bends in any thing resembling real athletic or dance poses, for example.  Please update!! I would easily give this app 5 Stars, with new and improved models with more realistic flexibility and joint and muscle definition."

"6571",887947640,"Let’s get the big topic out of the way. This game is a money milking machine. Natural Motion or the big dogs up top known as Zynga are some of the worst in the mobile gaming market. Don’t get me wrong it aligns up perfectly with its competition being NFS no limits and Asphalt 9. Both of which are just as bad in terms of “milking it”.  So let’s go into detail as to why I’m leaving this 2 star review. I doubt it’ll matter but here it goes. I was a hardcore player for several months. I enjoyed the game a lot and I had a great crew. That was until Natural Motion started shoving more paid events into the game. As time went on most of my crew mates grew tired of having to pay to complete certain events. Natural Motion decided to ramp up the difficultly on the free to play events so people are more inclined to spend money.  Practically everything has became a paid event at this point because you’re either locked out until you buy a certain car or you’re stuck in an event due to the difficulty increase. Natural Motion believes this is what players want. They believe that this is fair. Speaking of fair let’s discuss my most recent discussion with their in game support team.  In the past I paid for some fate of the furious cars. Enough of them to complete the ice charger event. I spent a good amount of resources to complete it as well. I won the car and at the time I had it nearly maxed out. Like I said before I was having trouble with my crew. I burnt through all my resources and no one was active enough to help me build them back up. I started losing seasonal milestone cars and then rewards because they were leaving.   Just recently I decided I wanted to start a new save file not taking into account that I should probably write down my previous player ID. When I got through with the tutorial I realized my fate of the furious cars that I paid money for were returned to me (without upgrades S6s or fusions). I went to share this on the official Sub Reddit where someone suggested I ask support about getting my ice charger back as I did pay money to complete the event (had to buy the cars to be able to play in it) seeing as I owned all the cars I used for the event on this new account I figured it was worth a shot.   I contacted support and told them in very clear detail that I had changed save files and would like my ice charger back going over that I had the other cars on my account and I was suggested to bring it up by some other players. Support got back to me with the response of “we don’t give out free cars as we focus on keeping the game fair for everyone. Keep an eye out for future offers” <- (this means give us your money)  Anyways to end off with my 2 star review I’d like to make a statement. This game isn’t fair what so ever. A good majority of the top players are well known hackers and cheaters yet Natural Motion and Zynga do absolutely nothing about it. They proceed to shove paid events down your throat and raise the difficulty level of events overtime so more people are forced to pay if they want to finish these events. The only thing fair is the fact that most players along with myself are tired of this crap.   If you think Natural Motion or Zynga needs your money do not worry as they’re already filthy stinking rich."

I do notice it does have a few glitches. These glitches include, randomly crashing, other dinosaurs attack harder even when your T.rex is at a high level, and dinosaurs will sometimes spawn upside down. I also found that the energy level decreases quickly. Apart from these issues I love this game and I’m glad to play it!"

"6595",890358046,"The input is very intuitive, more so than another notation app I bought for iPad. Unfortunately, after paying for it I discovered too many bugs which have not yet been addressed.  1. Copy and paste function is terrible!  When copying a bar to another bar it doesn’t put the notes where they were in the copied measure, they get transposed all differently depending on where you touch the screen, so you have to sort of guess where to tap the screen, and if you guessed wrong, which you probably will do most of the time, you have to copy all over again and try to paste in the right spot, which is ridiculous.  PLEASE FIX THIS!!!  2. Playback tool is too limited.  This should be more like a standard playback tool with rewind and fast-forward controls not just play and stop.  Also there should be a way to have it play back in swing like other notation programs can.   3.  The sound is buggy. Sometimes it just doesn’t work, and the only way to get it back is for me to restart my iPad. I shouldn’t have to do that, the sound should be more robust than that.  4.  There are some basic articulation’s and phrase markings which don’t exist in this app, such as marcato, falls, and glissando.  I would be happy to write a more positive review if these items could be addressed and if the maker or makers of this software would show more interest in supporting it with more frequent updates as these problems are brought to their attention by users like myself who actually paid for it."
"6596",890358046,"Have been using this app for on the go composing. Very useful once you get comfortable with the input methods. However this needs an update for the new iPad Pros (2018) so the app will display edge to edge. Also with the iPad Pros now supporting midi keyboards, note input via an external midi keyboard would be game changing."
"6597",890358046,"EXPORT FAILS - by any method.  What kind of notating software allows one to use an SATB template but not enter lyrics?  I’ve paid for the whole package, and no lyrics?  Massive shortcoming.  Other shortcomings: 1. Cannot search the help utility by keyword.  Many sub-level menu items hidden under parent items but not listed in tree form in the table of contents.  2. Cannot export Midi ‘parts’.  3. Cannot export mp3 renderings of Midi.  4. Cannot specify beginning measure number.  5. Copy and paste an expression - THEN BE ABLE TO EDIT THE EXPRESSION, else have to create new every time and unify format, say, if one is creating measure numbers because program lacks item 4 above.  6. Do NOT link song listing to Title property.  If I wish to maintain several revisions, I should not have to edit the Title in order to tell the difference between versions."

These guys must be raking in the money as it is the only way you can play this game in any sort of enjoyable fashion.  Minimum $25 for unlimited lives for only 6 hours.  Minimal turns that make it impossible to pass the levels presented unless you have booster toys.  Rockets that move in the exact opposite direction you need them to go.  Once you do spend money, you magically pass the level you couldn’t pass prior after multiple attempts. There is absolutely no way this game isn’t a complete and utter scam.  Don’t get sucked into it- it’s a bottomless pit. I hope someone takes them to court over it someday because it’s complete absurdity that apps can do this to the public."

"6622",891194610,"Great game graphics on point gameplay on point levels odd bc of the random vehicle section and the fact all the armor with front saws are the same and gets really old. One of the biggest most annoying problems I highly suggest fixing is the controls over time when you just really want to get to the next stop bc starting over same spot also gets old and boring, once your close for some reason you can’t hit your booster or gas anymore is works then doesn’t at all then you have to start again. Now idk if you did that on purpose so you can max out your parts or that’s actually a game bug but it needs fixing ASAP!!!! Please thank you and I recommend this game than the others!!"

Unlike the non-Pro version, you CANNOT save it and be able to go back and edit the games with various pictures. 3.  PLEASE all the features the non-pro hs and you'll have all 5 stars in the reviews!

"6630",891294826,"This game is fun and easy to play. One question though. How do I unlock the money magnet? I have way more gold built up than it says it costs, but there’s still a lock icon over it. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!"
"6631",891362701,"The first time I used this worthless app I put in a precise street address in Paris France. The app immediately put in a different address with the correct number but a different street. I tried to correct the error but it would not allow me to change the wrong address. What good is this app if it changes your address to another wrong address. What an expensive disappointment this is. One star rating because there is nothing lower."

"6636",891448329,"I started using this along time ago online. I didn’t know it was an app til now. It’s easy to use and shows how your body will potentially look when you lose weight. All you have to do is put in your height and how much you currently weigh, then put in your goal weight. It will compare how your body will look. You can change the settings to different skin, hair, and shape to make it look like yourself. They also have a male version."
"6637",891450541,"It's good because our 3 year old like paw patrol and he have fun"
"6638",891450541,"Just like everyone else said! Ugh!!!"
"6639",891450541,"I saw others with similar problem. App worked fine, then I paid for the in-app purchases and now the app won’t work at all!!! How do I get a refund or get it to work??"
"6640",891453663,"After struggling to decide whether to buy this or HD version I really regret my decision to save $ and buy this one because I knew there would be in app purchases as well. I opened the app the unlock the 2 additional levels and of course they didn’t work or wouldn’t even let me purchase them. What’s the deal? All the other paw patrol apps r great from my experience anyway so this was very frustrating. Try explaining to a angry 3 year old it won’t let me buy it! One star is stretching my rating."
"6641",891453663,"The iPad and iPhone versions are separate.  I was  told by support that the HD version is for iPads.  If you buy one, you can’t restore purchases on the other device.  Very annoying that you have to buy 2 versions.  Kids enjoyed the game but I refuse to pay more when I already bought the app and the in app purchases."
"6642",891453663,"I made an in app purchase on iPhone and can’t restore on the iPad after the main purchase! Very unhappy"
"6643",891528055,"We need more art like this. If you’re looking for a game, this isn’t it. This is a little universe you can look in on time to time. Buy it even if you don’t want to. We need to support this developer. It’s only 99 cents. If you like this, try his other philosophical experiment, “Everything.”"
"6644",891528055,"I’ve been running it under TvOS for several days and I can understand why some people are very negative about it. But if you leave it running, especially with a good sound system, it adds a minor, somewhat melancholy, but also interesting element to the day. It reminds me of Bob Shaw’s “slow glass”. My son thinks it’s just a Big Troll, and I’m familiar with David OReilly and maybe that’s how he thinks of it, too. But I’ll invoke the Author Fallacy and claim that it doesn’t matter. Mountain can be a small but interesting addition to your day, if you want it to be."

"6650",891700302,"It may seem strange but all the physics/quirks that come with surfing... are showcased here. This is about as close to real surfing as one can get... on an iPhone. Great for flat spells or rained out (toxic) conditions."
"6651",891700302,"The buttons don’t work properly and now I just wasted money for nothing"
"6652",891755554,"I thought it was weird that my 4 year old couldn't figure out this game as we have and love almost all the other sago mini games, but when he handed his iPad to me out of frustration I couldn't even figure it out. So you click on each tool and go through a boring repetitive series of sawing, hammering, sewing, etc. and then you find one of the characters standing in the yard with a tool and some building materials and no matter which way you swipe or tap the screen, NOTHING HAPPENS. is this a glitch? I want my money back. Make some more adventure games. Those are awesome. This one is a bust."
"6653",891755554,"Very simple controls. Bright colors and lots of sound effects."
"6654",891755554,"I have all the SagoMini apps for my four grandchildren aged one to nine. The creators have managed to capture the imagination of both girls and boys. I watch as the children choose their favourite character and laugh along with the activities. As an ex teacher I highly recommend every app in the Sago bundle. @JudeStevens"
"6655",892092770,"I Thoroughly enjoy this game it’s rather addicting it interesting concepts mix with a zombie theme is great I love the upgrades the competitiveness and the fact that they don’t try to get the user to buy the upgrade so you got to earn them I played the first one the second ones better if they make a third I’ll get that one too."
"6656",892092770,"This game is a really fun game and I love it, it does have a bit of blood, but it has no adds, unless you want to revive, or get 1 gold. I recommend this game for ages 11+, It takes a while to unlock stuff though so you have to be patient as you play. This is a super fun game and I recommend it."
"6657",892092770,"One of the best games"
"6658",892279069,"If you enjoy the night stars and have ever wanted to know what you were looking at or wanted to find something then Star Walk is the greatest app. I really like the ability to search all the constellations and planets to find where and when they are visible.

"6664",892320294,"I enjoy this game a lot! I liked it a little more when you didn’t have keys limiting your ability to gain gold and experience though. Still, I’ve adapted to playing and unlocking additional keys through missions and ads daily. However, there is some bug that has been affecting my game the last two weeks or so, not allowing the daily ad under the “Collect” card pack on the home screen to play. This effectively has kept me from obtaining any keys unless I manage to accomplish daily missions, which means attacking other territories would be meaningless since I would gain neither gold nor experience points. It keeps me from actually playing the game besides maintaining my defenses, so I hope this problem can be fixed!"
"6665",892320294,"The game is good and I Love it But I really hate The keys and I really don’t want to have keys anymore. But the game is still Awesome. I don’t want keys anymore. Please remove them. Thanks"

"6668",892393815,"I’m having this app for quite long and this is my preferred app for any voice recording need. Absolutely no complaints except following 2 items: 1. Unable to record voice using Apple AirPod. Once recording pressed it cuts off AirPod and uses only device mic. I’m not happy with this kind of app behavior. I think this should be fixed 2. If 5 recordings are in a folder & if I start playing the first one, it stops after that first audio. I expect it to play all 5 one after the other within the folder. This makes the whole playback experience manual."

"6682",892955084,"This app is ingenious and amazing!   There are so many different roles to play, and whether town or mafia, most of them are entertaining! It’s incredibly exciting to interact with other people and try to figure out who may be fibbing or concealing information. It’s imperative not to trust anyone... you don’t know who’s going to backstab you in the end! Sometimes, the dynamic of it all can be quite thrilling, almost like a real mystery. While it may be overwhelming to get the hang of at first, Mafia is easy to master once you have the basics down. There are so many complex strategies to put into play no matter what side you’re given! The game will make you laugh with pleasure of getting away with something, or seriously resolve to better yourself after suffering defeat. And since every set-up and interaction is different, you never know what kind of game you’re going to get!  I personally appreciate the game so much. I’ve had it for over a year now, and I’m still learning more with every login. I meet so many people who impress me wildly with their tactics, and since the community is always growing, you’ve never met them all! Overall, the app challenges my mind and entertains me at the same time. What more could you want?  (Well, maybe one request. It’d be hilarious if there were a Fool chat. Hahaha 😊)"

"6698",893448956,"I am playing this game on an iPhone X, and instead of using all the screen space, the app just treat my phone like a 7, and blank out the extra length, making the control very inconvenient. That being said, it’s a good game with cute graphics and intelligent mechanics. I saw that the dev updates the game a year ago, but can they please update it to fit newer models?"

"6733",895425891,"This is the kind of app I wanted to use as I have  a really nice gym in my front room.  Functional trainer, elliptical, bike, rowing machine, and yoga CDs—all out so I can’t ignore it."
"6734",895425891,"Literally have never had a problem. Like whenever I’m using it it’s just super easy. And Are used to have a running route but it was just kind of bad. Then I got this and it’s super easy staying in shape for the sports I play. Honestly most of my reviews are terrible because the other apps just ain’t as good as this one. Honestly one of my most used apps. When I saw the Under armor logo I just downloaded it because I thought it would be amazing and it was totally worth it I would recommend it to anyone. Keep up the good work."

"6736",895506023,"I found this app by searching “allergy cooking” and this was the second result. It looked promising because of the good reviews and the first screenshot advertises you can choose your allergies! However you can only choose from the most common ones (peanut, tree nut, egg, shellfish, etc) and you can only add five “very disliked” foods. I have over 20 uncommon food allergies to common ingredients such as carrots, potatoes, chicken/beef, etc... and my feed is mostly foods I put I very disliked. I assume it’s like this to get you to try to like these foods with good recipes but I need to avoid these foods. I wonder if the developers can add custom foods to the allergen list or an unlimited amount of foods disliked and actually filter the lists so recipes show up without those items. Thank you."
"6737",895506023,"App needs an option to search for users by name, an option to follow Facebook or Instagram friends, and an option to invite by text, email, Instagram, or Facebook."

With that being said there is always room from improvement, you guys always impress with new papa games, keep up the creativity...  But for this game in particular! I know the To Go Version has just been added and updated for mobile phones. I was wondering if the HD (tablet) version will get the same update, ie, adding the Holidays? If that’s possible I would really like to know."
"6749",895913573,"I think this game and the rest of your games are the best games to play! Even without WiFi! You basically take orders, make what they ordered. And then check how did you do. I also think the furniture is the best way to expande your wealth in the game. It would be the best if you can expande your restaurant in the upgrades section. I also want a update of refunding items you never wanted.  [UPDATE] Pls I’ve been waiting for almost a month for this update, please just do so!"

Plus, sometimes , my character moves on it’s own and my experience stays stuck and don’t move, the app needs some debugging. The makers of this game needs to make this game enjoyable and less complicated and upgrade for the clients and not for greed!"
"6752",896112560,"The game is the best fighting game in the App Store. They have done some nice new things to get some more action and to bring new life to the game .The graphics are some of the best I have ever seen they try to help the children and keep the game at a pg level which is a great way to keep them out of trouble and keep there mind creative. The management is very helpful and friendly staff so it makes for a good fun experience.just gets better with all the great deals!!"
"6753",896112560,"Can we use a controller for this game?"
"6754",896130944,"This app is great but please add a few things!  1- people should be able to promote more than 10 items! Why is there a limit?  2- why can’t we sell perishable  food items??? Everywhere else is allowing it and competing so why can’t mecari step up!  3- we should be able to offer our own coupons or promotions for our items! After all it’s our items that we are selling! And we should be able to determine who we offer coupons too!  4- there should be better capability to repost an item... that may not be selling-exactly!!!

And then it says if I want to dispute this decision which gives no explanation (not sure what to dispute) I can email and I guess wait until the 12th of never."

"6769",897446215,"The desktop version works fine, but I can't even edit photos decently with this app. It keeps crashing, makes weird changes to my edits, taps the wrong item, overall needs more improvement. I don't really like leaving negative reviews but this one really made my lose my patience."
"6770",897446215,"Before the latest update, Canva app was good and easy to use. I hate the app now. It’s not user-friendly, and the layout is such that when you edit text the keyboard covers the image so that you can’t even see what the frak you’re doing. On top of that, sometimes it will not even save my design in photos and can’t connect to Pinterest. Blech! I deleted it from my iPad."
"6771",897446215,"Edit: The business cards turned good. That weren’t as crisp as I thought they would be but I think that might have been the printing service. I still use Canva and referred family and friends to it. But one thing, like I said I have the subscription but on the website it acts as if I don’t and tries to charge me for the graphics. So I go to the app for my graphics. I’ve been also having issues editing text on the app as well. I find myself going back and forth between the website and app.  I hope that gets fixed along with the occasional blurriness, other than that, the app would be great.  I use Canva for all my product design. I have a bakes and confections shop and I love the designs I’ve come up with on here. I have the $12.99 subscription so I’m expecting the product to be consistent. Sometimes when downloading from Canva, the image is blurry which is annoying.  Even when using images and texts from Canva it’s self, it’s still blurry. I used a design I made on Canva for my new business cards so we’ll see how clear they print up. Overall it’s a great app. The occasional blurriness is an issue."

"6777",897544254,"I got this game a few days ago. I was a little bored, wanting something to pass a few hours and possibly delete at the end of the day. However, this game wasn’t that. I discovered firsthand that Seashine is a fun, addictive, game with beautiful and haunting settings. The game balances that perfectly with fun simple controls and never ending discovery and gameplay. The description is right, the game does change each time you play it! My point is, I highly recommend Seashine to anyone who loves a good indie game."

And please make a (PLEASE) ultimate sim where you are a wolverine first, a otter next, a skunk third, a opossum fourth, then a raccoon fifth, and a badger sixth! Please make the sim! You made games other people wanted and I loved them! There’s no doubt they won’t love my idea! PLEASE!!😓😓😓🦡🦡🦡 (by the way I don’t know the name of this family!)   Thank you"

But this morning my friend showed me this app which allowed me to get back into Osu beta, I love it since some pc games are getting ported to mobile and you can try it early with this. Love it!"

"6802",899277186,"Beautifully rendered app. The interface is easy and the graphics are smooth and look great.        No, this probably won’t help you with any kind of troubleshooting or simulated engine modification.        Yes! It’s the best portable app I’ve seen to show someone the basics of what’s going on when they fire up their car. Plus, if you’re a gear head, it’s just fun to look at now and then.       As another reviewer said, I’d like to see some diesels added including the opposing piston type. Perhaps a gas rotary piston engine. I’d also like removable layers for distributors/ignition modules, cam/crank position sensors, and spark plug wires.  I’d even be willing to pay a reasonable amount to add these features to my existing app. I’ll update to 5 if this ever happens!"

"6805",899441948,"Does anyone else have the problem that Toto wants to take a bath/shampoo all the time? Very frustrating for the grandkids. I'm using an iPad.  Developers, PLEASE FIX. I have asked before!"
"6806",899441948,"The turtle Toto is charming, and you can take care of him. I like how you click on the egg to hatch him. You can interact with a few things in each room/ floor he is in such as a bed for making Toto sleep, a ice cream maker to feed him, and an area to give him a bath.   There’s also a item menu at the bottom that you can use too for more interactions with Toto. However, once you go to all of the floors of the house you realize there isn’t anything new left to do after that."

Because I want the giant panda toy to be his punching batterler and please change the stupid music on the radio 📻 to be disco music that’s for any age any size because I love disco music instead of baby music because it is so dumb.

I attacked the lions and me and my family drank from the pond. The next day, it was even hotter! I found a pond with no water in it! I traveled far and wide to try to find the freshest, cleanest water. After a few hours I finally found some fresh water. Now that I can smell water, me and my family will never have to be thirsty again.                                              THE END!"

"6823",900333528,"This app is good for calorie or carb tracking. It has most of the foods I’m looking for and it is easy enough to input what I can’t find in their system. I would love to see an area for recipes and fitness tracking.  Also, it says it’s connected to my Apple Watch, but I’m not sure what that feature does."
"6824",900333528,"I love being able to track my dietary intake.  The app let me set my allowable carbs, fats, and proteins as well as my daily points.  So I am able to follow a Keto diet using the app.  The one thing I can’t do is delete a food after I save it.  This is either a glitch in the app or I just haven’t been able to find where to go to delete it.  I over came the problem by just setting the serving size to zero so it doesn’t count."
"6825",900333528,"App is a good replacement for WW at a fraction of the cost but it does require some additional explanations. It also will not sync with other devices but I can live with that. Really don’t understand the macros and some of the servings and how they are calculated. All is all it does the trick"
"6826",900404152,"This game is very realistic. One thing that stands out from other dev’s flight sims is that this one has many functional panels.

"6844",902026228,"There used to be free options now like every other greedy person out there they have decided your kids can only have a chat or call if you have money! I live below poverty level and this means I can no longer use this app for my kids."
"6845",902026228,"I’ve paid for maybe 3 apps in the past. This app is free but has an in app purchase option to get all the premium videos and calls. Worth every penny. A direct line to Santa. Santa has helped us out even after the holiday season. Sometimes kids need a little help remembering to listen, pick up their toys or to go to bed when they are told. Santa can help encourage them to do that. Even when it’s not Christmas, kids tend to listen to Ol’ Saint Nick. I love this app, and when it’s time to renew my premium content purchase for the upcoming holiday season, I won’t hesitate. If you need a great app that puts you in touch with Santa himself, try our this one and you’ll be good to go."

"6848",902062673,"This game has been my literal no-brainer game for several years. It’s small and simple design has kept me coming back for more. The occasional changes in landscape, be it a cactus, a cloud, a color shift, brought an element of satisfaction simply because of their rarity. It was a joy to see something new. A reminder of how pleasant the simple things of life can be.   However, upon reaching hole 10,000 today at 26,476 strokes, something new I did not expect occurred. Hole 10,001 did not generate. Instead I found myself on the shore of an endless ocean. Hmm, I thought. Perhaps it’s a fluke? So I rebooted the app and there was still no new hole. I hit the ball into the ocean, and the ball vanished beneath the water and did not regenerate again. I no longer have a ball to hit. Nor a hole to shoot for. The game promised infinity, but the game literally ending like this exactly at hole 10,000 seems like it’s an ending by design. If not, the game has broken at hole 10,001 and I’d like to keep playing. As far as endings go, I will say this does seem like a very appropriate ending for this simple game."

"6861",903418970,"It's all ugly and creepy kids should not know about pregnancy and everything is locked ITS ALL AWFUL!!"
"6862",903799541,"It just comes into focus & within the boundaries of the frame, but there is no auto shoot nor any way to activate it independently. Waste of space!"
"6863",903799541,"Don’t bother with this"
"6864",903799541,"Love how this works on all bar codes and tells you about product."
"6865",903911740,"i have been eating whole real food for years now but i am new to plant based eating. this app is well organized and easy to use. i like to cook new things all the time so i love the wide variety of recipes and new ones are added often. i also love the ease of adding ingredients straight for the recipe to an organized shopping list. this app is well worth the $5!"
"6866",903911740,"So in all fairness I haven’t made anything yet from the app. But I’m a expert plant-based cook so I know good recipes when I see them. App is also very easy to use. Highly recommend for anyone seeking to be more intentional about what they eat."
"6867",903911740,"I am never at a loss for delicious, healthy meals and desserts! Forks over Knives is the best!"
"6868",904013027,"Amazing game, super fun to play even solo, but I came across a pretty big glitch regarding the new Alien Presents mission. I don't have Alien Technologies, but I somehow selected the Alien Presents mission and the selection registered and saved. However, now my game crashes whenever I do anything in the ""New Mission"" tab. I can't switch mission to either of the vanilla missions (Doubles and Batteries or the normal presents mission), since that crashes the game, and I can't even hit the X button because that crashes the game too! The deck selection is missing, likely because there are no decks available without buying the expansion, and I can't start an Alien Presents game, since even that crashes the game. Everything else appears to remain functional, and I'm playing my vanilla turn-based games without any problems. I can even start new non-mission games!  Still, I don't want to wait ten days for the mission to expire. Could I have some help getting off this mission?  Edit: LOL I CAN JOIN OTHER ALIEN PRESENTS GAMES AND ONE OF THEM STARTED have fun patching this out"
"6869",904013027,"Asked for the board game for Christmas. Playing this in the meantime. Terrific game! So well balanced and very fun. Great theme and mechanics."
"6870",904013027,"Well worth the $5"
"6871",904052407,"I was so happy to know and app like this existed, until I finally purchased a ticket through them. I just lost $1500 due to their lack of transparency with their transactions.  The ticket I bought through them, never said that I could not exchange it nor that it had ANY restrictions howsoever. The airline that I flew with told me that my ticket had all kinds of restrictions such — I can’t change my return date because we bought the cheapest option through hopper and that if we wouldn’t have use hopper, we could have exchange the dates directly with them.   At no point while I was purchasing this ticket I was shown this during the check out process.   We contacted hopper about this issue and they were in no way helpful. We are yet still to see the fine print or where those restrictions where listed when we purchase the tickets with them.  We are taking them to court as this is completely unacceptable and unreasonable not to respond with a positive outcome but to “apologize”.   I have no return ticket due to their lack of transparency. This is a company with no moral integrity."
"6872",904052407,"I was booking a RT flight, all done and attempted to purchase. That is when I started to hate Hopper. Went up to the purchase and window says we recognize you, why not sign in? Okay, so  I clk on the window, now I need to fill out all the same info I have already completed. Then I get the text to confirm it is me. Nothing after I hit the link. I am suddenly back to filling the whole thing out again to sign in. So I faithfully fill it out...again...hit the link on the text...again...and back to the future I go to fill it all out again🤬 Luckily the THIRD TIME I FILL IT OUT AND THE LINK WORKS.  It was the last time I would have ever used Hopper if it hadn’t worked that last time. Life is hard enough without having to fill out the same info a total of four times before it works."
"6873",904052407,"Great concept, lovely UX and design! But crashed at a critical moment during checkout, causing me lots of stress... did it book my flight or not??? ... turns out it did."
"6874",904207373,"Colors need to be updated so people with mild deuteranomaly color blindness can play. At least let us know ahead of starting a game whether we are playing against one other color or two other colors. Sometimes I can’t tell until I’ve lost that there I was actually playing against two different yellows, for example.  I really like this game, but the update to the daily challenge makes it extremely rare for me to be able to win now, because every game in the challenge is different, and if I misidentify colors in just one, I’m out.  Sometimes using night mode helps, but not always.  Please consider this type of update for this game: I have noticed another game or two listing this improvement while updating game apps."
"6875",904207373,"Just wish the colors had more contrast. Sometimes the colors are too close to distinguish. Otherwise, great game."
"6876",904207373,"Not a lot has changed other than more videos to annoy you and eat more if your mobile bill each month.  Not into videos that basically cost me to watch every month due to the data consumption they cause."
"6877",904209370,"I have had B612 for at least 3 years and I loved making music videos.  But then it got updated and now they only have one song on the music part and it gets really  annoying listening to the same song over and over again.  I really wish that the company would restore all the music it had before and maybe some new ones?"
"6878",904209370,"Amazing app makes me feel a lot better about myself and helps me make funny videos/ pictures"
"6879",904209370,"Every time I try to call the future that thing that shows up to tell you what to do just won’t go away"
"6880",904223061,"So I’m not as good as I thought I was with memes but it’s still funny even after 15 tries on the first level then watching the meme.. like a complete lunatic 🤣 it’s still fun funny and probably most weirdest (in a good way) game I’ve ever played"
"6881",904223061,"Great game but ive gotten 64 ads and im on level 6.. Why so many adds"
"6882",904223061,"I find nothing wrong about it if you actually like the game you would not care about the adds I absolutely love this game !!!"
"6883",904278510,"Just wish there were more stages in single player.  Waiting for a new stage"
"6884",904278510,"Hitman is a awesome game like it on PlayStation and like it on the iPhone"
"6885",904278510,"When I found this game it fun I played and got new weapons but add some new maps FOR GOD SAKE and new weapons from known games for example add a burst rifle from Fortnite just add some new stuff plsssss 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑 add new update or something like add more enemies to kill or a pvp mode or a base defense mode 😐😐😐😐😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😐😐😐😐😑😑😑😑😐😑😐😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 ADD SOME NEW STUFF 😡"
"6886",904418768,"This app allows me to familiarise my self with the surroundings of places I haven’t even been to yet. This is good for travelling and exploring new places. Great Experience"
"6887",904418768,"The latest update will cause a black screen when attempting to enter VR mode!"
"6888",904418768,"Does it work? Yes. Is the UI designed TERRIBLY? Also yes."
"6889",904481505,"Like you’re game is just too 😎  I  can’t stop playing it 🥰😍🦅🦅🦅❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"6890",904481505,"1)First off they need to update it so I can’t even play with iOS  2)The controls are really bad really hard to control I bought it for my little sis and we had no idea what to do  3)The shark does not even interact with other fishes NOTE:if you have no problem go ahead and get it"
"6891",904481505,"This game is not very good."
"6892",904737541,"It is an amazing Game"
"6893",904737541,"Very clever design, entertaining, great graphics. Most of the levels are challenging but fun. Unfortunately, they drop into the play-to-win model at the later stages, teeing up levels that are impossible to beat without spending cash. I’m ok with that for a free game, but for one that charges to download, they automatically lose two stars."
"6894",904737541,"Fun."
"6895",904737816,"My progress on my iPad won’t upload to my phone"
"6896",904737816,"Not only is it challenging, the game maintains it's same humor. The things the characters say are my favorite part of the game. Origins is definitely my favorite out of the series. Love that the game doesn’t nickel and dime you."
"6897",904737816,"This company can do no wrong!  This game is amongst the best ever done!"
"6898",905121703,"You stop maintaining the game, delete the Crazy Wheel and the gold mine but you can still collect money for add ons. Ridiculous    The least you could do is put the Crazy Wheel and gold mine back."
"6899",905121703,"I have been playing this game for a year now and am in level 16. For the second time now all of my balloons in all of the worlds are gone! The last time this happened it took quite a while, but then all of a sudden they were back. It just happened again and I’m thinking I should probably just delete this game, but like I said I do like it other than this issue. Has this happened to anyone else and if so what was your solution?"
"6900",905121703,"Game won’t update after world 21. Called customer service and they said it’s not them it’s the developer of the game. Sad sad. Been waiting for the update since December of 2018, don’t waste you time or money. Sad sad!"
"6901",905488045,"Here is a tip for noobs:  DON’T DIE!!!!!!!   Whenever I lose, I go back to the start and loose everything I owned.  This game is so frustrating, and I don’t know how to get hearts. All the enemies and so hard and never die! If you haven’t bout this game yet, think about whether or not you are good at video games. If you are, go ahead and get it. If not, keep searching. I heard Swordigo is free."
"6902",905488045,"Such a fun game and a joy to get all the achievements. Will keep you engaged for hours. Wish they would expand it since it’s been a couple years. Definitely my favorite iPhone platformer"
"6903",905488045,"All I have to say is that it is awesome and I love it!"
"6904",905729701,"Thee only bad thing is that they ONLY let you run for so long."
"6905",905729701,"Ok how do I start this? Well this game is ok. I mean you tried. I can tell but it’s got some problems                                                Pros Nice background (I just really like it)  I like sound affects  I like you have 2 attacks instead of one                                                Cons Some things have no collision  Running button should stay on until you tap it again or your energy runs out  You should make eating like in cat sim  No jump button  Needs more pack members  If you fix these things this could be a great game. Please fix and have a nice day!"
"6906",905729701,"Okay, I love your games! They are the best, and I know you take lots of time and effort to make them, but how about adding more? Every game is basically the same now....but you just play as a different animal and similar things. I think you should have some more unique and realistic features for your games. Maybe you could have it in the Ultimate Lion simulator where you could have up to 15 pride members, since real life lion prides usually have more than 6. And in some of your games you could add it to where your pride, pack, brood, etc members could challenge you, and you’ll have to beat them if you want to keep control over your pride, pack, brood, etc. If not then you’ll be kicked out and you’ll basically have to start over (not level wise, but start over with getting a mate and den). It would also be cool if you had to actually protect your family members. In real life, I’m sure things would try to attack you. Like in the Ultimate Dragon simulator, you can add it to where a battalion of knights may invade your den and try to kill you and your brood, or maybe you could have thieves try and steal your gold. I also think you should have to protect your territory in some of your games (such as Ultimate Lion, Wolf, Bird, etc). It would be so much more realistic! I’ve played quite and few of your games, and I’m very impressed, but I do see spots where you can make these games even better! I would really appreciate this if you have taken your time to read this and think about my suggestions. These are just ideas, so don’t feel pressured or anything!   —Thank you!"
"6907",905852173,"Who else is here because they saw it on David’s insta story.....just me? Cool. 💛💛"
"6908",905852173,"Really can't elaborate more than that.  It's a fun game but the Apple TV version is buggy.  It gives a pop-up after Level 5 asking for a review (in poor grammar, at that). Worse, the pop-up covers the screen and there is no way to make it disappear...except perhaps by giving a review in the App Store.  Will find out soon enough, because that's the only reason I'm bothering to give this review.  Pester someone for a review and don't be surprised if you get 3 stars or less.  UPDATE: posted review here and STILL getting a pop-up asking for a review. Downgrading to two-stars"
"6909",905852173,"This is a great game I love playing it but there are too many ads!"
"6910",905921908,"I don’t really remember the game because I played it so long ago but I re downloaded it now and it’s fun"
"6911",905921908,"Game is really pointless but fun."
"6912",905921908,"I like the game but they should make characters a little less rare"
"6913",906681058,"I love this app but since i got back from a vacation a week ago and updated it , a black screen appears and i have to reboot it twice. Please fix it so i can go back to my shopping rituals.😊"
"6914",906681058,"I love the shopping experience but the delivery times should be improved"
"6915",906681058,"Les marques vendues sur cette application sont fausses!!!!"
"6916",906826053,"Such a good game.  I wish there was more like it out there."
"6917",906826053,"Hello Please please update this game Regards."
"6918",906826053,"Can’t load game from iPhone to iPad; iPad just crashes.  No support available from website on this."
"6919",906936224,"I really love the Manhua in the app but then I can’t buy it!! Please fix that problem! Thank you!"
"6920",906936224,"When I read the summary of this app it said that it comes in English and simplified Chinese however I cannot change it into English. I do not know what I’m doing wrong but if there are any steps to changing the language I would like to know."
"6921",906936224,"I like it"
"6922",906995758,"It’s a very good app and help me a lot when I do my homework~"
"6923",906995758,"解决了我的智商尴尬"
"6924",906995758,"不错的程序，试用中！"
"6925",907002334,"I am a 10 years user. This website was very easy to use and I always search movie based on their user reviews until now, the rating of movie and tvshow seems unfair in some case. A lot of paid ghostwriter gives movie a very high rate even though its actually a trash. I am sick of this fake rating system. Time to say goodbye."

"6928",907174449,"Bought game for Grandkids...purchased all the tracks and the downloaded to kids iPads.  Requires you to purchase again!  Not going to do so for each iPad..certainly don't want game on my iPad now.  Stay away from this if you're using Family sharing."
"6929",907174449,"The app was successfully purchased but can not download it????!!!! ."
"6930",907174449,"Bought this for my grandsons fifth birthday after he saw the add on tv.  He was very disappointed that the track advertised required an additional purchase after paying $6.99 for the game.  There are only a couple of tracks open for play.  All the others also require additional purchase. Shame on you Nickelodeon!  He really enjoyed what was open to him but finished it in a couple of hours."
"6931",907210971,"$3.99 only comes with 3 tracks and the others are behind a pay wall placed in front of the kids after they finish a game. 1.99 for each subsequent track. Find something else. At least make this version free if you are going to charge 1.99 to unlock additional tracks."
"6932",907210971,"My kids liked the app. They are 5 &2 and both enjoyed racing. But after paying $4 for and app you can only race on 3 tracks then you have to pay 1.99 each to race on the remaining 4 locked tracks. If I'm gonna pay $4 for an app I expect it to be free to use all of it."
"6933",907210971,"Bought this game for my 3 yo and every time I try opening it it crashes. I want my money back."
"6934",907239855,"its not the most decent game, but it is one game that will keep you playing for hours."
"6935",907239855,"Pretty good game man, ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ worthy."
"6936",907239855,"IM SO ADDICTED TO THIS GAME I PLAY EVERYDAY KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"6937",907405413,"Everything costs!!! The app is free but to use it costs??? Who wants to see something with no audio?"
"6938",907405413,"been using chrome cast for the past two years. I have not watch regular TV. I’m up to date on all movies.I love to watch TV and movies awesome chrome cast is awesome awesome. And is easy to use best thing ever made."
"6939",907405413,"When I connect now, the app doesnt load on Chromecast anymore!  It just shows a spinner on the TV and then exits back to the chromecast screen without ever showing the app screen.  I know chromecast still works because youtube casting is fine.  Help!"
"6940",907470416,"Such a ripoff have to buy full version!?thought it was fun but now I hate it I would give 0 stars if possible 😠😡😤"
"6941",907470416,"Okay so you buy the game and then once you get to the 5 you get so frustrated because you have to use money to get the full version . It kind of fun at first. My sister loves it but I mean she's seven so..... Do NOT get this app it is a waste of time!"
"6942",907470416,"Just don't even try this app, wasting time to explain about it and waste your time to read this."
"6943",907759227,"I bought this app for my daughter so she can learn but there is no sound!  I have tried to reboot, max the volume in the set up, etc but nothing worked!!!  Wasted my money. Not very interesting just looking at pictures with no sound!!"
"6944",907759227,"Garbage there is no sound in the app."
"6945",907759227,"Not kid friendly- not easy to locate what you are looking at - waste of money"
"6946",908071717,"This app is really useful for students like me who forget their homework on multiple occasions"
"6947",908071717,"I have been looking for a good gaming app and this met all of my expectations. It has great graphics, no lag, 500,000,000,000GB of storage. 900,000,00,00000,00000FPS on all epic settings and I became ninja over night  | | \/  Now that’s e🅱️ic"
"6948",908071717,"I have no excuse to tell my teachers that the homework was never sent (much sad) (very cry)"
"6949",908073488,"The game blends lore and the mechanics perfectly while creating a want for progression each time you make a mistake and end up dying. Something that’s great to do for a short while and pick up later or get lost in for hours."
"6950",908073488,"Idk what happened but after about 15-20 minutes of play through, the game just crashes. When I open the game back up, it’s as if I haven’t played at all and resets my progress. Please fix?? Thank you!"
"6951",908073488,"This game is amazing! I have not yet completed it, and I keep being killed by the defector. I keep playing, and have found that this game is so fun! I hope you make another game... !"
"6952",908384544,"Interesting story. Different types of puzzles. Great map to get you where you need to go. I would recommend. But, some items can't be selected by picking on team directly, you have to do an edge. But still worth playing the American."
"6953",908384544,"Got this game because I like hidden objects. This game has a lot of bugs on my iPad. A lot of the objects you find you have to press 3-4 times before it registered. One of the puzzles was a three part and it wouldn't switch over to the others. I even reset it and did over and still no luck. Had to hit hint to get it opened. I will finish this game but not very happy with it."
"6954",908384544,"This game was released May 2015 with a free trial then purchase. It had a great rating then so why don't you show it as a re-release. Good thing I checked my purchases. Not very honest Big Fish."
"6955",908456072,"Fakeeeeee"
"6956",908456072,"This is so stupid waste of 99 cents computer is much better if u want to play this play it on the computer"

"6960",908511009,"It's AMAZING!! Just please update it to be more like the new ones, like telling a Mate or a Family member to stay in the Den to watch the Egg, Playing as your Family, and Name them. Please do this, anyways I love the game!"
"6961",908519492,"Wonderful app for single or group mind and fun therapy"
"6962",908519492,"I recently switched to the newest iPad Pro and while everything I did on my previous iPad still runs, everything I do on the new iPad does not run. I’m at the point at which I’m building worlds, floating islands is where I’m starting with my new iPad. The world.place elements run just fine but when it’s time to move the character nothing happens. I tested this in different levels that I’ve not completed and get the same results, the character doesn’t move.  I still have my old iPad for now and even tested it on that one and same thing, the character doesn’t move.  I couldn’t find anywhere to report this issue which is why I’m posting it here. Otherwise, I love this app."
"6963",908519492,"Hello to whoever is reading. I used to have pbs kids scratch jr. now I have scratch on my moms computer and now I have this!

"6964",908842747,"Idk what's wrong with all the reviews in here from last year! But everything is good! 👍🏻 It works fine! Only thing i wish, i Wish it has frequent use option or suggestion on the actual emoji😭😭"
"6965",908842747,"I still love but typing isnt on point. Needs a major update. Hasn't been updated since 2015. About to be 3 years."
"6966",908842747,"Downloaded and uninsndbre downloaded it and didn't work what so ever how it says go to Themeboard- Themeboard option wasn't there wasted time in something that didn't work really disappointing. Tried several times even with a paid for one"

"6971",909087462,"I love this app I have had en elf for almost 4 years now and this I am sure it is going to give him lots of ideas"
"6972",909087462,"The app is great, but most of the ideas are wayyyy too much work for someone in need of desperate thing for their elf to do. Otherwise, the ideas are so cute, and I enjoy this app!"
"6973",909110675,"I love the features that come along with the books. Reading appears interactive with some light background noise and sound effects that make reading fun. I have been pleased with it so far until I went to update the app but now it’s not working anymore. Followed all the instructions and recommendations on how to get the app functioning again but so far, it keeps crashing on me every time I try to open it. Can I get someone from the company to help me get it up and running again?"
"6974",909110675,"I absolutely love this app"
"6975",909110675,"I got this app so that my 6 year old granddaughter could practice reading. She was reading mr brown on this app and she kept saying the word sound instead of go and she told me that in the book ( board book) the word is sound not go. Can you please explain why the words are changed and the book is longer in the app?"
"6976",909195466,"This was a waste of $5. I’m sorry I ever bought this game!!"
"6977",909195466,"Please ignore all reviews. I am a cosmic ahole."
"6978",909195466,"Though beautiful in look and sound, this game is an unholy mix of relaxing puzzle solver and twitch game.  Could have been as legendary as Journey if the level designers had more discipline."
"6979",909196467,"Keeps playing an ad every two seconds then crashes."
"6980",909196467,"This app was fantastic a couple of years back. Now when browsing the internet the app constantly crashes, or won’t play videos. 3 years since the last update? I think it’s time."
"6981",909196467,"Crashes Doesn’t Work any longer"
"6982",909254807,"Easy to use"
"6983",909254807,"this latest version of this app forces port 8080 open on your phone without any authentication needed!! HUGE issue when using public wifi. there is a button to turn off this feature they call “WiFi” under the “More” section but it does NOT WORK. moreover the default for this feature should be off and not on, otherwise the developer is opening users up to security threats unless the user knows about the feature. but since the on/off toggle button doesn’t even work that is a big deal breaker.  deleting this app immediately, let me know when it is fixed and i may consider reinstalling."

"7006",909730184,"I have seen this game floating around the App Store for at least 2 yrs, always thought it looked cool. I haven’t had good luck with twin stick shooters with iPhone usually cause how small this iphone is and yes it does make it more difficult but this game is fantastic it’s a really well done rogue-lite-like twin stick shooter with gorgeous graphics, magic spells and grenades! what more can you ask for.   If you haven’t tried this game yet, like me, and you’re in to punishing games, get it!"
"7007",909730184,"This is my second time buying Leap of Fate. First on pc, where I wanted to play with a controller but found it awkwardly inclined towards mouse targeting. On mobile it has an unsettling quality to directional input for either movement or firing direction. The touch input has been implemented to surprisingly intuitive effect for special skills, a thing I found irritating when using a controller on a the pc version."
"7008",909730184,"First off, I've been playing this game for about an hour nonstop and it's amazing. I love dual-stick shooters and this is among the most beautiful, unique, and polished in all the App Store. I keep thinking Transistor (one of my favorites of all time) in a dual-stick shooter format. This game is so good, they could have asked for a lot more in terms of price; it's a steal. My only complaint (and I hope the devs are reading this) is that the camera is a bit too sensitive to every movement. When you've got to do a lot of dodging, it can be a bit jarring. I think it could be easily smoothed over in an update (it's certainly not a deal breaker nor does it take away from gameplay). Anyway, amazing job, Devs. Thank you for making this amazing game and thanks for bringing it to iOS!  Update: I still adore this amazing shooter but I’d love to see iPhone XR screen compatibility. Please!"

"7024",911006986,"This is basically a ‘choose your own adventure’ book with animated graphics, and tactics battles. There is some resource management to be done, but it doesn’t add much of a feel of control or choice.   The graphics are really nice, and nicely animated, but the battles are short, the battlefields are small, and as much of the game consists of reading and making dialog choices as battling. The tactical depth of battle almost makes up for the small battlefield, and short battles...almost.    All in all, it’s not my cup of tea. I may, or may not finish the story, and I probably wouldn’t mess with the sequel unless it was on sale for a buck."
"7025",911006986,"This game is an amazing experience"
"7026",911006986,"I loved this game on Mac and now playing through it on hard difficulty on iOS. Unfortunately I encountered this gamebreaking bug: after the first fight in the first war, the gray screen appears with a clickable arrow to go on to the following fight. I spent a long time carefully orchestrating a good strategy that took a good anount of time to plan and play out, maybe 25 minutes. The arrow on the gray screen however wasn’t clickable and the game essentially was stuck; I tried anything I could think of like rotating the iPhone screen, tapping home button then coming back to the app, tapping and swiping anywhere...to no avail. When i hard exited the app from the OS and restarted it, as knew would happen, the war progress is gone and I need to start from the last auto save; very frustrating after a long, hard fight that had gone well and I don’t think I’m going to try it again after a while given it seems like it’ll just hang again...  This game is a wonderful work of art and a great accomplishment in terms of game design, artwork, music, and I find it very unfortunate that a few polish issues got by the quality assurance that really interrupt the flow and immersion. I actually encountered this exact bug on the Mac Desktop version, but in that case alt tabbing out and back took care of it. I have a hard time believing this somehow never came up in testing and somehow wasn’t taken care of. I’m on iPhone 6 by the way.   My actual rating for this game is more like 4+ stars, but I am currently frustrated at the loss of progress, and it would certainly be 5 stars if bugs like didn’t appear, as well as some small improvements to the display that I wrote about in a rewiew of BS2: when displaying all armor / str flags in combat, surround enemy flags by a red outline to make them stand out from your own heroes more and make it easier to parse information; add a second buttton that when pressed shows numbers next to the enemy units on the battlefield representing their turn order: 1 for next, 2 for one after that etc. These small quality of life improvements to help display information and the player parse said information that is already available,more easily would make the game more of a pleasure to play, for me personally."

"7030",911115712,"I am really annoyed because I downloaded this for my daughter to watch Paw Patrol and other Nick Jr. episodes while we are traveling or out and about. However, only one episode is unlocked. The others are locked and say we need a subscription which we have Charter and can get Nick Jr on our Charter. I am not sure why they are locked. When I go to fix it, it says grownups need to put the code which I do and then it freezes on that screen. I am completely dissatisfied with this app."
"7031",911115712,"It worked for a while with my cable provider, for a few months it won’t even send me to a login screen or use my TV provider logged in on my device to access cable information. It just keeps asking if I am a subscriber (which I am). I have troubleshot everything and now I am just annoyed. At least Disney Jr and PBS still work just fine without all this headache."

"7035",911130812,"App always crashes and never loads when there is a shock drop or quick enough for me to usually get anything good. I also never seem to ever have success on any of the drawings, nor do I get exclusive access on really anything. Just seems odd."
"7036",911156590,"Cool"
"7037",911156590,"I’ve downloaded a few other drawing apps before and this one is the best free one! I should invest in a pen to draw with and I’ve only been using my finger on my phone screen but I haven’t let that stop me from making super detailed characters. Thanks for such a great free app! My only complaint is I can only zoom out of the largest sized paper so far and it doesn’t allow me to draw anything too large, I’ve only been able to draw a character full body a couple of times and I couldn’t get as much detail as I would like, but, no major complaints at all since it’s free, I only have it on my phone and I don’t have a stylus lol, so that much is really a personal preference, as well as wanting more texture tools to draw with, but again, it’s free (I think?) so I’m content."
"7038",911156590,"It’s a bit slow I don’t know how to get the layer off when I’m drawing otherwise it’s pretty great!!!"
"7039",911201894,"You buy the game. You play it. No servers, no log-ins, no in-app purchases, no excessive layers of currencies and pay-to-win mechanics. I had nearly forgotten phone games could be this straightforward. I bought this on a whim after the release of “Hero” in Smash Bros. reminded me of the original game (which was called “Dragon Warrior” in the U.S., in case anyone is looking for that game). Very happy with the purchase.  The game itself is very old school. You’ll be doing a lot of grinding, but the touch screen menus make that more tolerable and it’s a decent enough way to pass the time. Most phone games force you into grinding anyway, but suggest you pay money to skip it. In this one you’ll just have to slash away at slimes until you level up to take on better enemies like the old days. The overworld controls are a little goofy, like all phone d-pads, but they get the job done and finesse is not needed in this kind of game. I like the vertical orientation; it makes it easier to switch in and out of the app to do stuff on your phone without having to turn the whole phone.  The updated graphics and music give the game a cool SNES vibe. I’d love the option to use the original graphics/music/screen resolution, but I can see how that might be infeasible given the phone layout. In any case, love has clearly been given to this port, and if you like ‘80s JRPGs, this is well worth your $3. I’ll probably play through the series and see if I can convince myself to check out DQ11 for Switch eventually."
"7040",911201894,"First time playing through these classic dragon quest games and thanks to the mobile ports they are easy to grab and go. play for 15mins and stop, go do what ever and come back and pick up right where you left off. The port is self is pretty good to me at least being able to customize the controls location and only once during my play through did i freeze, but because of auto save the game froze or crashed, I closed the game and start up right before that event happened truly a great port."
"7041",911201894,"I’ve never played the DQ series before nor did I want to. Yet after the release of “The Hero” in SSBU (smash) I couldn’t hide the fact that the music and game interested me. I’ve never played the NES version or the other remakes besides this one on IOS. I got to say that this is a game I’ve been missing. It was classic RPG in its finest. I used a YouTube video title “how to beat DQ in 5 mins” and I don’t regret it either. I enjoyed my experience so much I became a fan. This is my first time playing the game and I got to say that it is a 5/5. I told my wife that I think I would love DQ more then FF if I played it first. The price is beautiful too. Can’t beat it. I hope you liked my first review. I’m on a mission to clear every DQ game on IOS. Check me on the other games review too. Keep track of me. I’m here.  #firstreview"

"7068",912561374,"Oh wait I did! 😆 but I have zero ability to have ever pulled it together - so I’m REALLY GLAD someone else did! And they did it well 👍🏼😊  Sometimes I get questions when I try to add people. Such as: isn’t this just like FaceTime or Snapchat? Or why don’t you just text videos back and forth?  As far as I know, FaceTime doesn’t have the option to send a video message if it’s a bad time to chat in the moment. And to answer all questions at once, the features and layout of MarcoPolo are centered around easy, fun communication via videos. No other app does it quite as well.   Critiques: I do wish there were more filters since I hardly ever wear makeup and sometimes I like to hide behind a good “fire-breathing dragon” face.   More importantly tho... As a new user, it’s a bit confusing at first and I’ve accidentally recorded and sent some videos I didn’t mean to. Perhaps this could have been avoided if I watched the welcome video 🤷🏻‍♀️"

"7084",913943275,"The hifi files on Tidal are noticeably better than the crap on Spotify and I sprang for a subscription as soon as I heard one. Although the catalog is a bit more limited, it contains almost anything if you know how to look. But that’s not easy, especially if you’re interested in anything outside of mainstream pop. Like maybe classical. Do a search for Felix Mendelssohn, for example, and it returns about two dozen albums of the “classical moods” variety, stuff by b-list performers. But search for the Emerson Quartet, and you will find their recording of Mendelssohn’s octet, and others. You have to search by performer. If you want to compare recordings of a particular composition, you have to make a list of them from some other source. Like maybe Spotify. This really limits Tidal’s usefulness as a music discovery tool, and although I really like the service, I can’t give it a higher rating than 3."
"7085",913943275,"Review of Tidal Hifi. This sound quality is great. Not only are you getting lossless audio, you also get proper dynamic range (0-100Db)! This has taken me by surprise. For example, a song suddenly exploded after sounding a little soft. That's how music was mean't to be heard. Even if you choose ""high"" instead of ""HiFi"", you still get the same dynamic range.  One thing I would like is Siri support. This way, I can ask Siri to play a song and she'll play it on Tidal."

"7087",914079393,"This game is garbage. You fall like 200 miles per hour but when you jump before, you fall normally. Yes, it’s difficult and is sometimes fun, but if the mechanics were better the game would be better."
"7088",914079393,"The game is to hard and is not his fun and is his fun has fliplly water cup and disn’t have different modes"
"7089",914079393,"This game is basically flappy bird except you tap only twice. There’s no actual objective. You’re not doing anything but tapping on a screen and rage quitting after 5 minutes"
"7090",914136002,"Game runs smoothly and is pretty fun!"
"7091",914136002,"PROS - It's a great TD. I love the graphics and mechanics of the game. It's definitely a new twist on TD.  CONS - There are more than a few achievements I haven't been given credit for in Game Center. Also, gameplay can be extremely difficult. I've been stuck on the third boss for a month now. That's ok though. I'll beat the level with power ups.   Please fix achievements in Game Center!"
"7092",914136002,"Seems well-developed but game doesn't scale very well to a smaller screen. The action is tiny. Wish I'd known before spending the dough."
"7093",914189520,"I love this app, the the last episode and the fourth episode is my favorite I love it, I can”t stop playing it. Can you please make another app please🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺. And make sure to make it about Pandora again please. I love it!!!!! Best game ever!!!!!!!!. I also want you to know that I like the part when Pan battles against Din too.   In the app the characters in the animations are cute except for Din. I like how you made the other bad guy a girl, I remember this app when was I think 7 now I”m 10. I thought you had to pay to do the other episodes but no.  Whoever made this app is so cool, because it teaches that courage, family, and friends will help you out in hard times.   I saw you added Aladdin, Harry Potter, Frozen, also Game of Thrones, ext.  Pan is also cute too She is my favorite character in the Pan adventures series, I liked how she saved the world also.  I love this app hope you make another app soon about Pandora again!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜"
"7094",914189520,"Very fun and I love it"
"7095",914189520,"Loved it!!!"
"7096",914433115,"It’s fun, and that’s all"
"7097",914433115,"The iPhone X has been out for years; do you guys ever plan to support it?"
"7098",914433115,"Every now and then I’ll play this. Once you start it’s hard to stop, sort of like cocaine. I’m surprised this game doesn’t have thousands of downloads. Great quality, lots of fun, Early 80s Miami coke disco soundtrack, Keeps you on the edge."
"7099",914471589,"I acquired a score of 418 on my flight home from a vacation while on airplane mode and when I landed my high score remains at 276 on the leaderboard even though it says I got 418 on the actual game. That would put me at #26 on the leaderboard. Disappointing."
"7100",914471589,"I dont remember downloading this game.. did it cost money?  Someone help me.  Heres 5 stars tho.. i havent even played it yet :)"
"7101",914471589,"In my opinion it's a good game BUT there needs to be more stuff to it to make it more original like more power ups or skins l actually have an affect on game play"
"7102",914517987,"I just got this today and I can't even find the makeup. The good thing is there isn't a free trial like the other ones so it isn't a total scam. But it is kind of a scam. It just wastes our precious time. How much time do you have to to sort out how to work this app look for something else this is a complete scam."
"7103",914517987,"I love love lovee this app it is the best app ever!!!!!"
"7104",914517987,"Very happy with this app. It has everything I need. Happy with how if covers the blemishes. 😄"
"7105",914673497,"Cool game"
"7106",914673497,"So glad this is updated to work for iOS 12! Very excited, I was sad to not be able to play for some time!  Suggestion— custom dragon looks could include different horn types, wing types, tail types, etc :) keep up the good work!"
"7107",914673497,"This game is fun, but there are quite a few errors. First, the white fire is glitched so you can’t buy it, the rest of the family is like on top of each other and are literally inside each other, and the enemies glitch so you have difficulty killing them. The next issue is that once you kill all of the bosses and unlock everything, there is really nothing left to do. I’d love for the map to be much bigger, so it’ll take much longer to explore. What would also be nice is that there are more abilities for the dragons, more colors, armor, and fire colors. It would also be wonderful is being able to be whichever dragon in your family you want. Thank you for reading this, and i hope you fix."
"7108",914865605,"This game is fun but I have an idea you should make a game exactly Like on other consoles but for mobile so you can play whenever you want."
"7109",914865605,"I love this game! It’s so addictive! There just needs to be a little more costumes. It would also be nice if we could create our own levels like in the console version. Other than that I give this game 5 Stars!😁"
"7110",914865605,"I have the stickers for the rsbr shirt and every time I click it it’s saying finding Voucher and it says error try again later"
"7111",914893190,"This game will you blow you away from other stuff"
"7112",914893190,"Need to add where we can play friends.. it would be much better"
"7113",914893190,"I’m"
"7114",915071248,"I never write reviews but I love this game and I haven’t even played it for long! One problem with it tho is that sometimes the marine life floats in mid air and attacks you but you can’t get it back. Don’t get me wrong I love this game!"
"7115",915071248,"The den does not look like anything at all. I thought the den was supposed to be a cave with coffee. LOL. But the bosses need like 2 more too."
"7116",915071248,"Alushia was a beautiful silver dolphin with white swirls on her, but unlike other dolphins she had colorless eyes they were instead a beautiful silver. She did not have a pod she was abandoned. She was a resourceful strong smart and independent girl herself she could live with out a pod or mate. Not that she was ever given the chance. She was young when she had been abandoned but it had been years and she had grown she become a long slim beautiful dolphin. She was swimming along looking for some dinner when she saw a big shadow... then suddenly she was snatched up! She did not even have the split second she needed to fight or flee or do something! So she waited and thought up a plan or something. Soon she was thrown out of the attacker’s grasp and into a cage. She swam around with her long slim tail keeping her afloat. Then she heard something in the back of the cage like a clutter of some sort collapsed on the ground then under a pile of trinkets she saw a male about her age he was a spotted dolphin and has large pale blue eyes almost colorless like her own.. not bad looking either but who cares she was trapped in a cage with a klutz and a king crab who thought who could go around sacking dolphins. The dolphin male finally saw her and held his gaze for a little too long.. well buddy boy looks like we’re in the deep end of the ocean now she said to him in a sarcastic tone. Oh.. umm yes I suppose so I must now regain my soul from looking at the.. wall for some minutes miss he said unsure of himself but sure that his life choices in his life had not gone right but now it was good. Alushia interpreted this from his unsteady facial expression and endless staring at her. Look this is getting annoying with your staring so snap out of it! Although she was annoyed she secretly thought his clueless face and klutz moves were adorable was a shame she was trapped in a cage. I as the narrator think they would be adorable! Anyway... THE CRAB KING WILL SEE YOU NOW! Said a large Orca... yeah well the king crab can try but he ain’t getting his grubby pinched on me WHAT OF THE EVERS CHILD DOLPHIN! Can you English today mister orca? ENGLISH OF THE YES? (Btw that was not meant to offend anyone at all and I sincerely apologize if it did) they were pushed into the throne rooms and heard a large booming voice coming from a large crab.. OH I SEE I HAVE TWO DOLPHIN THIS BOY HAS BEEN HERE A WHILE HE IS USELESS NO SKILLS AT ALL! BUT CLEARLY DOLPHIN FEMALES ARE THE GOODIES YOU KNOW THEY CAN DO ANYTHING AS I HAVE SEEN FROM WATCHING YOU MISS ALUSHIA! EVEN MAGIC! magic what in the blubbers name are you talking about? HAHA SIMPLETON IS IT YOU WHO CAN WHISPER TO THE WAVES? Umm more like is it you that needs some serious help with your little brain? HAHA YOU ARE FUNNNY! YOU ARE THE OCEAN WEAVER OF THIS DAY AND AGE! The ocean weaver is just a little fish tale.. it’s just the one animal in the sea that controls the sea and friends to the ocean right? IT IS MY CHILD AND IT IS YOU I HAVE SEEN IF YOU DO NOT SEE TRY IT RIGHT NOW! Umm whatever you old hag of a crab... oceans and sea can you hear me I am the weaver of waves can you see make a wave make a splash as soon as I say all seas smash! Then the ocean went silent no sound came and then she said ALL SEAS SMASH! And a huge wave came and splashed down into the ocean. Sh3 went silent.. I’m I’m the the.... YES MY CHILD YOU ARE THE OCEAN WEAVER AND YOU WILL GIVE ME THE HEART OF THE SEA!"
"7117",915074326,"So I think this is a good game for children but the thing is well anyone can play it but it’s annoying how the thirst and hunger does not save when you play it again you come Bach to half hunger and thirst"
"7118",915074326,"I like snakes like cobras,vipers,rattlesnakes,and tree boas.This game inspired me to like snakes 🐍 .I love simulators."
"7119",915074326,"This game is super fun! I love to hypnotize my enemy’s, it’s so cool what they do! (Once you hypnotize them they start fighting a nearby animal). I think you should make an Ultimate Snake Simulator! You could have different types of snakes, different types of venom that would do different things, differnt types of hypnotizing that would make the other animals do different stuff, it could be cool! ( oh and by the way please make this game less laggy (glitchy)). So ya, it’s a fun game and I think YOU should get it! 🐍🔮🍴"
"7120",915083784,"I like this game but I don’t have a pod yet. It could be better if you made a whale simulator. start as the beluga whale and level 5 unlock the minke whale level 10 unlock the pilot whale level 15 unlock the gray whale level 20 unlock the sperm whale level 25 unlock the narwhal level 30 unlock the humpback whale level 35 unlock the bowhead whale level 40 unlock the fin whale level 45 unlock the right whale, please do it."

"7123",915223450,"I waited years for a Japanese handwriting input app this functional. Recognizes English handwriting pretty well too."
"7124",915223450,"This app is very good at what it does, but it presents a bug when used with the Apple Watch. If your watch is in one language (such as English) and you try to dictate a message in another language (such as Japanese) on your watch, the watch incorrectly interprets your speech in English. This happens despite the fact that the last message you wrote using this app to the same contact on your iPhone was in Japanese.  Normally, the watch interprets speech in the language of the last used keyboard for a specific contact in Apple's Message app. Therefore, in order to get the Apple Watch to interpret your speech in the correct language again, you must go back to your iPhone and select the standard Apple keyboard for the contact in the Message app. This is very inconvenient.  This is the only reason I rate this app with only three stars. If you don't have an Apple Watch, then this app is great."
"7125",915223450,"Good: handles a large character set and the recognition is good. Bad: there is no way to select a character that is not in the list it shows. There is no way to fix incorrect character segmentation. The return key does not register in Javascript web apps."
"7126",915249334,"Thanks for amazing Application now i can organize many things in one application  🌹"
"7127",915249334,"i dont activet for ios 12.4.1 plz check for update"
"7128",915249334,"I don’t know why I have to open my “notifications” to make this thing work. It’s unnecessary and it wasn’t like this before, so what the hell happened?"
"7129",915375908,"Please bring this back!!!"
"7130",915375908,"Please update to work with latest OS. My daughter has been begging to play this forever."
"7131",915375908,"Please update to iOS 11.  My granddaughter loves this app and is disappointed that it does not work now."
"7132",915545000,"The kids noticed that the little monster icon had changed right away!  They loved the Halloween themed fun.  They were screaming to each other that the little monster turned into a pumpkin or that there were candy treats, or that the monster either was shrinking or disappearing!  Positively gleeful here! Thanks so much for the clever changes,"
"7133",915545000,"My kids love the new Halloween update. So much more to do now ☺️ They love how drinking the different potions does different things to the monster (do this by holding it up to the monsters mouth for a few seconds until you see the potion bottle flip upside down. Each one does something different!!) great job!! 😁"
"7134",915545000,"I got this game for my 5 yr old son and he loves it. I also think its so fun and you can get lost in time trying to find different parts that you need to swim or fly. So fun!"

"7136",915637540,"Great"
"7137",915637540,"I love this app so much"
"7138",915861546,"The only way I scrapbook anymore:)! Great app!!"
"7139",915861546,"(See update below) The app hooks you in by promoting monthly kits and the entire Project Life schtick is to keep current on your scrapping. Great, I’m behind that 100%. Happy to pay something every month for a monthly kit to use; I’d even be happy to pay for a year’s worth of kits in advance. Only problem .... kits are several weeks to a month late. Makes it hard to stay in the moment. However, the developers seem happy to charge an exorbitant amount for cloud storage, many times iCloud or Dropbox rates ... that makes me wonder about where their priorities are.  Update (downgrade): monthly delays are killing this app. I realize that Becky Higgins has gone through professional and personal changes lately but the users have paid money based on what the business owners promised. Trying to be sympathetic but based on her Instagram, she’s spending her time/energy on other things. If she’s going to abandon supporting the app, I wish she’d tell us."
"7140",915861546,"I love love love this app. It is my favorite way to make quick scrapbook pages. HOWEVER, the quality of the soft cover book is severely lacking. The glued binding didn’t last a day. I have several years worth of albums to print but I am little nervous about wasting my money. I may try to the hardcover next time and hope for the best."
"7141",916130071,"mrs cow shut up"
"7142",916130071,"Look it is wayyyyyyy to hard to get all the characters together,the first time I played it was easy,the parents didn’t come back to pick up their children as fast and I got all the babies to the pool,but I played it a seconds time and...well I was missing one character,the dog,so I waited for him to be dropped off,but another parent came, the pig ,to pick up their child,so I got out of the station and then went back,and I hoped for it to be the dog and his dad/mom, BUT THE FRIKIN PIG CAME BACK!!!!! So I tried again and again AND AGAIN, but the pig CAME BaCk! And I just quit to write this review soooooooo... fix that please,and also I want more locations for the characters to visit like maybe more of the beach the pirate ship is on or something else but I would like to have more places to explore with the characters. But I have to say I am older than three to four years old and I still enjoy the game so kudos to you dr. Panda for keeping me entertained with your games for years,thank you for reading,bye for now."
"7143",916130071,"It’s actually kinda fun but it could have been a little better if u added more areas in the water park because I actually get kinda bored when just playing in the same areas as always"
"7144",916215494,"Now it’s a joke.. very shady practice from this/these app developers."
"7145",916215494,"since I can't give it 2.5 stars I'm going with 2.  If I could simply make collections with my favorite Spotify and Soundcloud tracks, that alone would give this app at least 4 stars. Maybe 5, after I've spent enough time with the app to know what rating it deserves. As of now, I can't access anything from Spotify accept for empty playlists. Nothing has synced. I don't know how long it's supposed to take. If it finally does sync my library, I'll change my rating.  At current, I can only give it 2 stars and a monthly subscription isn't even a consideration."
"7146",916215494,"i regret updating this app , why you have to ruin such perfect app"
"7147",916281743,"I found this game preloaded on a phone I bought years ago. I like the game so much I downloaded it onto every new phone I’ve bought. Then last month it started crashing regularly. They updated it within the last week and now I am constantly bombarded with adds that are not immediately skip-able. It just ruins the game. Time to find a new game."
"7148",916281743,"Is anyone having trouble with this game I’m on 270 and it freezes up on me I have to stop until the next day?????? Please fix this game it is still freezing up after you play 3 games"
"7149",916281743,"Love playing, always a challenge"
"7150",916366645,"Love the iPhone version of Procreate. XS Max user and I’m constantly sketching ideas or doing mini studies on my phone. Also a night doodler, which brings me to my one issue. After the update I haven’t been able to endure the white back drop at night. I’ve looked for night mode options on the preferences and see none. Have also looked online for it, no success. It’s so painful staring at the white contrasting backdrop. Is there really no option for it? That’s my one major issue, I miss the dark interface. Would gladly recommend the app but please help in that regard. It’s an awful thing to be stuck with, ruins the experience. Thanks for everything else. It’s an incredible app in every other way, a mixed media artist’s dream come true. 💗"
"7151",916366645,"Great app the only problem, is that it’s glitching a lot"
"7152",916366645,"I’m not even good at drawing or creating anything but I still bought this app because it’s cool to mess around in and create weird+random things. I’m hard to impress but this app impressed me because there’s just like so many options for drawing tools and the app is easy to figure out and work it."
"7153",916540089,"Awesome sleep therapy."
"7154",916540089,"Franz’s apps are astounding and stunning in every way! I adore Sunny. I’ve never heard anything that actually put me right at the ocean. Put on your headphones or earbuds and you will believe you’re there! I’ve been struggling with stress and anxiety, and have been trying multiple apps to help. I’ve found my port! When I started listening to Franz’s apps with the real, full-bodied sounds of nature, the most beautiful music, and looking at the gorgeous, vintage-feeling artwork it took my breath away and my eyes actually welled up as I was instantly filled with peace and calm because it was so beautiful and real!   Thanks to Sunny, I feel as though I’m actually lazily, lying beachside listening to the waves roll in and out.  Franz, you ARE amazing! Thank you! 🙏🏽"
"7155",916540089,"One thing I really like about this app is that it allows me to time my sessions. And if I get a phone call in the middle of the session, I can look and see how much time has elapsed so that I can finish my session. None of the other apps will keep track of how much time you have spent for the day. I only use the timer daily count for one day not over the course of a long period of time. I think you have to buy the app for that."
"7156",916585802,"This game is so good just from looking at the title I need it was good I love it so much and have always been a big fan"
"7157",916585802,"Honestly a great game. I also love your channel and hope you can make more games like this one"
"7158",916585802,"I beat the game and it was one of the best wizard app games I played"
"7159",916728593,"They keep releasing updates that have really made effort feel less impactful. And the last update broke the app. It won’t even load. Find something else"
"7160",916728593,"Over the years, I played Stormfall, Rise of Balur with few accounts. Plarium has updates quite often with too many bugs. Average once a month. Some updates cause more problems than before, and every major updates add new revenue schemes. Worst part of Stormfall is bad connections and request to relogin. Stormfall requires latest hardware with high powered CPU, much memory, and high bandwidth connection. My new iPad 128mb wasn’t good enough for last update. I had to relogin after almost every click. Frustration is an understatement.  This is after a new owner and multiple major upgrades. Developer wants detailed failure data but it doesn’t change much afterwards. Even top tier coiners who spend hundreds of dollars per month (thousands in some months)doesn’t always get best customer service either.  Another unfair thing about Stormfall is there are lots of Russian federation players who can buy game currency at less than 1/10th of EU or US players. They can buy more troops for cheaps and kill your league easier.  Why do I still play? Many good players left but few players I have developed relationships with are good. Otherwise I would have quit too. When my game mates are gone then I’ll be gone too."
"7161",916728593,"This game has become exclusively about who is willing to pour money into the game versus the game used to be about work and reward as well as team comradery. The Tower feature is an unnecessary addition and really is not enjoyed by those who play the game. Once again it rolls back to money-anyone who buys their way in/out and around advancement glitches within the game is a happy camper. They are always the strongest and capable of rushing 70-80% of their fellow players. The face that they receive VIP status for both playing/spending just reinforces that the game developers are more worried about financial gain than member retention. I really wish everything in this game -as far as ranking /needs/ and building strength did not revolve around paying for 3/4 of it. At this point over 1/2 of 20 leagues I played with have already abandoned their castles and quit playing all together. For the average person looking for a way to relax and enjoy a game -I wouldn’t recommend SF, but if you are above average economically with a competitive trait and have money to burn-then I would recommend this game. The spenders seem to love it!"
"7162",916741290,"Elegant and easy to use interface, but it lacks important attributes. The best way I can describe it is: simplicity at the expense of key features.   I would suggest the following:  1. Incorporate Face ID. Currently, it feels as though my financial information is exposed.   2. Make the widget customizable and interactive. Currently, the widget feels like a shortcut to the app. It shows information I don’t need or want to display while my phone is locked. Also, the widget should be interactive in a way that users can enter new transactions directly from the widget.   3. Remove the constant request to subscribe to your newsletter every single time a budget is created. Leave it in the settings as an option or a one time pop up when the app is first installed. Currently it feels very forced.  I absolutely love how beautiful and easy to understand this app is.  Thank you for the opportunity to use your app and provide feedback."
"7163",916741290,"The app is slick and looks great. It’s easy to use and only gets easier the more you use it.   The only gripe I have with it is how finicky and hard it is to swipe on the main screen. Swiping right or left both have the function of switching through your budgets, or if you start your swipe closer to the edge of the phone it’ll go to all your budgets or your expenses. It’s a little hard to operate.  Other than that, it’s really clean and simple. One thing to note is that it does not link to you bank account and automatically track your expenses. However, I prefer this more because automated expense tracking often messes up or categorizes incorrectly. That’s just something to keep in mind."
"7164",916741290,"I just don't understand how to use it, really. It doesn't make sense to me. But that doesn't make it a bad app."

"7189",918054748,"The “Room” games are outstanding and my favorite way to stimulate my brain. Beautiful to look at, clever puzzles, and vastly entertaining.  I have to add to the discord about the two ballerinas in Room III, however. Not only does my ballerina ignore closed paths, but the button used to close them acts of its own accord. It’s on, it’s off, and my finger on the button has little to do with the result. I spent an hour one day trying to get her in place, then closed the game in disgust. Next time I reopened, the ballerina went to her place within minutes, and I had nothing to do with it. Frustrating. If not for all the other notes I’d think it a glitch. As is, I don’t know what to think.  But buy then all, anyway. They’re perfectly splendid games. A little anticlimactic at their ends, perhaps, but nothing that five minutes of fireworks wouldn’t fix.  Josie, Philadelphia"
"7190",918054748,"I am not smart enough to play this game. May I have a refund please? 😂"
"7191",918054748,"My husband and I love these games!  We play a chapter a night! It is well worth getting these games.  Best games out there.  CAN’T WAIT FOR ANOTHER ONE OR TWO CONTINUING THE SERIES!!    Yes please.   Donna"
"7192",918138802,"This games isn't the greatest, some levels you have no chance to beat the first few times. It is kind of addicting in a fun way. I like it!"

"7203",918609651,"Do not purchase Money Pro Gold product with the expectation that you will be able to import account information or that they will be adding additional banks in a timely manner, if ever. To my dismay top financial institutions in the USA are not supported such as DISCOVER, CITI CARDS, BARCLAY CARD. On their product community forum, purchasers around the world are being asked to submit their requested bank, which will then be “voted on” by other users to determine if it will be added to their system.  DISCOVER was requested four months ago and still hasn’t been added. Buyer beware. I’m glad I Purchased this with my American Express card so I can have the charges canceled for failure to provide service as advertised and paid for. This company is a total joke. Vote???!!! And we might consider it????!!! After I paid????!! When I contacted customer support, this is was the reply:  No, we do not have any estimate, unfortunately. We gather the information to help us make a decision when we add a new or change our current provider. If your bank is voted for, we will definitely consider that."
"7204",918780702,"July 4th update was bad but the newest update is just the same, if not WORSE. The balls get stuck in the portals no matter how many you shoot inside of them, each emotions power, when activated glitches and doesn’t actually work. Currently just unlocked fear at level 203 and his power literally falls right off the screen and the orb is wasted. I’ve played this game for over a year and it’s the worst it’s ever been, so sad. The new update makes this game nearly impossible to play now. Successfully at least."
"7205",918780702,"This is a very fun game for many ages. I got through 18 levels in a day because I love this game sooooo much. If you are looking for a fun,interactive, addictive game to play get this one!😀"
"7206",918780702,"I used to be on a super high level. But I stopped playing. I recently started again at level 1.... I’m now where Fear is. When I use his feature, it just shoots the ball down and it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. So frustrating. I will stop spending my $ on this game and delete it soon if it’s not fixed ASAP."

"7211",918902604,"My friends and I love playing this game, but there should be a mode where you can play with more than 2 players. You might even have a sort of free-for-all where your ship can travel to the other person’s screen and you can move and fight from there while you control from your device. It would be EPIC. Maybe even an online multiplayer version where you can fight with others around the world and have a customized ship. (Kind of like agar.io, but you try to get kills—not eat others) And then have a campaign sort of version where you fly through levels and maybe obstacles and then have enemy ships that aren’t just the three types in “defend”: circle, triangle, square. Have like boss levels in the campaign. That would be super epic and would make this game even more popular. DO IT."

"7214",918997182,"I mean it’s a good game and everything. But when I try to access the creopedia it goes to a black screen and nothing happens. I usually just close the app and just load the game again and it still happens. Is it just the game, or my phone that’s causing this to happen?"
"7215",918997182,"It could be better if the encounters occurred less often. I didn’t even make it to the other side of 50 acre woods, the encounters were so often and I kept getting lost. So 99cents spent and not worth it."
"7216",919008215,"Loving the game so far!"
"7217",919008215,"The MFi controller standard was released in 2013. The fact that a side-scrolling platformer released in 2016 does not support this is a bit odd."
"7218",919008215,"The update fixed the achievements which I thank the devs for acting quickly on that; however, it seems that one achievement still doesn't work...regardless which ending you get it always gives you the 'bad ending' achievement...and I've tried doing many things like delete, reinstall etc. but to no avail...I emailed the devs about this again and hopefully this will be fixed."
"7219",919010633,"The game doesn’t even cover the screen. It only covers like 75% I can’t see most of the game"

But I still have to tap the screen where the button would be if the screen is normal. I don’t know what is going on. The only idea is that the game doesn’t support iPhone xr’s"
"7221",919010633,"I played the first one didnt have the chance to play the Second one but I saw a gameplay of it. I can tell this one is not even the shadow of the first two. I mean is not bad game but the New mechanics are Messy and anoying. I remember playing the first one was so addictive, fun and simple. Now you have to pay if you want to keep moving in the game.. even the adventure mode you need “swords” to play it. Why?  Bring back the first Two this one is not that fun."

"7225",919097064,"So I wanted this game for a long time. Every time we’d go to Olive Garden I used to grab the little iPad thing and play Toca Boo the whole time. But when my little sister came along, when we went to Olive Garden so took the iPad thing out of my hands. I just looked at my mom with a mad face and she would just say “ it’s okay she is little, do you want her to scream over a little game? Here, we can get it on your iPad so you can play it everywhere.” I say “okay mommy” then I just glanced at my sister playing that game. But when I finally got it, I was occupied for one day, then I got a little bored of it. But in my sisters opinion she loves the thing to death! She plays it nonstop! But in my opinion I think the Toca Life games are better but that’s my opinion.... OH WAIT!!!!! I have an other opinion too! I would recommend this game for younger players not like a 9-12 year old. I think the kids who love it the most is 3-6 but again that’s my opinion. YOU DO YOU!!!! ;) thank you for reading my very very long review!"
"7226",919097064,"Hi their I💘 this game! But just a tiny suggestion😬,why can’t we go outside? I mean,like can you scare outside,or do YOU have a problem with that!?😡"

"7229",919395844,"It’s a great game to play especially when I was deployed but I feel the game needs a modern update with more responsive controls and more things we can create other than a revolver."

"7233",919478091,"Most manga introduced in the US is A+ rank in Japan, but we have really wide range of selections. Some may be B class for the niche market, like gamble enthusiasts to specific sports fans, sexy stories, or forgotten gems never made it to the mass market, which is rarely introduced in the US. But that doesn't mean they are bad. They just targeted very specific readers or missed the time . All the manga here is original Japanese, somewhat old, no translation, and not everyone knows it, but If you happened to be able to read Japanese, you will find something you will really like."

This app is amazing, adorable, and funny (I love the part where the gnome burps at teatime but the best is definitely when the monster farts in the lake 😂😂 😂). All in all amazing app it is definitely worth your 2.99 and the space on your phone, iPod, etc. So I'll conclude with 5 stars and a big thumbs up! 😁         ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 👍🏻"

"7242",920054061,"Upate 4-1-2019. I am so happy they are still supporting this game.  It's been a long time since they updated the game.  I wish they would go back and have the Halloween event and make the game more active with different events for the holidays.  I love the game and have been playing for several years now.  They really need to upgrade the max level in the game which is now level 60.   Update: 8-1-17.  I was so happy today to find an update for more maps.  Thank You!!!! Several months ago I asked one of the staff on Facebook if they were going to do any more updates for this game and a few days later I got a message back in bad English that there would be no more updates.  I'm glad you listened to all my e-mails.  I love this game and please keep the updates coming.   Update: 11-8-16. The last update was great as they dropped the prices down on the repairs.   The game is fun to play and it's fast paced. The game gives you a lot of chances to open up chests.  I would stay to the chests that you have keys for other wise you will be spending a lot of money on diamonds.    I under stand the game developer want to make money but geez don't Robb the customers.   I do like the game and the challenge but will be careful on wasting to much money on diamonds. I do believe in supporting games I play and will spend some real money."

Besides college tuition, my A&P books were the 2nd most expensive part of school.  I had to pay over $500 for two, yes 2, books on human anatomy and physiology.  If the publisher decided to add/omit/ or change a word or sentence, guess what? Yes, we were expected to purchase the new book(s)!  Selling your books back to the book store was a complete JOKE!  I was told, “we’ll give you $100 for everything.  I had also purchased (separately), the Anatomy Coloring Book, which was an excellent relaxant, and helpful memorization tool, and an advanced set of A&P flash cards). $100 dollars? Really Barnes & Noble? Disgusting!  I still have everything from my start to finish of school!  I wish that I had had this amazing A&P app when I was at school, and started memorizing the entire human body’s anatomical features and their physiological importance to our very existence.  I would’ve only had to take A&P once, not twice! 😂😂🤙"

"7247",921022358,"Unless youve got a lot of free cash floating around, forget it. Double drops...forget it, they adjust it so you get the same as a normal drop day(50% less drop rate on a double drop day is still regular). They also take away places to farm stuff and completely do things that they post and say they wont do, an absolute load of l*es.(they constantly say one thing then do the other.) I dont mind a little bit of spending but good grief these devs are just absolutely dragging the whales and crackins through the mud while choking out the free to play or lower spenders..even the whales are complaining about having to face whales 24/7...this game will go the way of star wars force collection, right into the apple dumpster bin in 18 months. Changed the game from 8”attempts “ to 5, lovely now shards rarely drop..it really seems like the dial down the drop rates on fresh characters as well, until their not really needed. One credit heist per month now, ridiculous! Only one day on the events bc we are progressing “too fast” ridiculous! Took away two zeta drop and gave a gauranteed one, ok but the two dropped maybe once a month so why take it away?!  Hint to the devs..you still need f2p for the whales to beat up on, if i was a whale and i was only facing other whales..id be more likely to quit now. They say players are progressing too fast so then they change and restrict how fast you can get stuff so you have to spend more. Former head developer even said she expects you to spend $1,000.00 a month to stay conpetitive(see what i did there), pfffffff. Now the game lags a lot after these relics(which are op af, but i like them). Still playing for now, but not giving up a dime for this garbage. Hey devs, every time you try to force a player to spend youve made less money that month, if you let us decide then youd probably get further witj that..if only this community were as big as the battlefront loot box fiasco community we could actually get them to listen. If you like throwing money into the toilet with a constant dopamine crash cuz youll have to spend to get ahead again the next day, then this is the game for you, step right up!

Without your app I wouldn’t take the time do mail a letter, let alone include pictures. It’s so much better than email and social media as well. It provides a means to be send something personal and thoughtful that, by nature, doesn’t solicit a response. It’s nice to just send some love for the sake of sending love. Thank you so much for what you’ve created. You are a blessing."
"7259",921902664,"Like many of you, I first heard about FELT on Shark Tank. Immediately I thought of a family member living overseas. I thought of her because she frequently sent all kinds of cards while living in the US. I was sure she would continue to send cards, just not as often because of unpredictable mailing times and the added expense. For over a year I have made a gift to her account. Each month she sends various cards to family and friends in the US. I especially like the ones with pictures of her children.   The FELT staff are extremely helpful in making it possible for me to replenish her credits throughout the year."

Please decrease the amount of ants in their environments I beg you to.  4.you only gain dwarves by 1 so once you get to level 12 you should get 2 dwarves.  5.Coins are so rare so I think you should make them more common.

"7277",922488002,"I’ve been playing Word Bubbles for over two years. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become fully addicted to a game on my phone at age 64. I had completed more than 2000 levels and I was in the Indian Ocean. I was distraught when one day I opened the game to discover I was back at level one. After many frets, I contacted the support team. They went above and beyond to restore my progress. Love this game and can’t thank them enough for the support."
"7278",922488002,"Love this...."
"7279",922793622,"Best E-mail app ! Get in coming mail faster than others."
"7280",922793622,"Use good"
"7281",922793622,"Enjoying this so much. Now I quickly and easily see the emails I need to see—so efficient—I feel 1000 times MORE productive!!  The junk and spam are easily managed and removed."
"7282",923138396,"Been using this for years love it."
"7283",923138396,"The keyboard currently is only in Japanese"
"7284",923138396,"いいね"
"7285",923268741,"PLEASE"
"7286",923268741,":))))"
"7287",923268741,"UPDATE THE GAME"
"7288",923441570,"Make it free access no paying"
"7289",923441570,"Cost to much money"
"7290",923441570,"This the stupidest game I ever heard it always come out on slither.io this game is stupid"
"7291",923555295,"The game plays fine except the voices or volume goes out and I can’t hear the game until I close out the game and restart then I can hear the voices for about ten seconds then it goes out again so the only way I can tell what going on is through the caption I’m thinking guess what the caption doesn’t work either the game is really alive when the voice acting is working but now I cannot understand what is going on in the game so it’s not playable if it can get fixed with an update it would be great all my other games on my iPad work and I can hear them so what’s up with this one maybe I shouldn’t have brought the bundle if I cannot play it I want a refund"
"7292",923555295,"They really need a 2nd one to continue the story because the storyline is amazing along with the gameplay."
"7293",923555295,"Sound cuts out"
"7294",923760656,"Well, Lost is my favorite tv show of all time, and this game is basically Lost + zombies. I can't believe how cheap it is. I throw so much money at these BS games that just kill time -- I would be willing to spend a decent amount of money on an expansion or console version (although it’d essentially be Dead Island - I just really love this game.)   I was starting to think this game was getting repetitive until I prematurely tried to disarm the center island tesla, then I realized I should just go work on the third (NE in my case) island first. And HOLY MOLY the third island was like a whole new game entirely. So many more bases, a hidden little oasis through a tunnel of trees, with actual decorations in the houses that you can take. Crazy amounts of zombies, but crystal transformers at every transit location.   I love this game and cannot believe it isn't more popular.   Anyways -- the few cons I've noticed (that don't make the game unplayable at all) :   Zombies get stuck in walls, a lot of the dig sites don't work, sometimes auto aim doesn't seem to work but I suppose that could be user error, there could be different enemies or some more change of scenery.   Anyways -- spend the three dollars and try it out. It's a hidden gem of the App Store. I’d legit pay a good $30-40 or so on a PS4 version."
"7295",923760656,"Honestly not worth the cost. Buggy"
"7296",923760656,"I played this game for a long time and placed down a cabinet and my game crashed.  So I load back in my inventory and my house was gone. Everything I had disappeared in one second."
"7297",923772792,"5 star game and 5 star adaptation of the physical game - absolutely LOVE the weekly challenges and all the DLC. *EXCEPT* lately I can’t make it through a whole game without the app crashing half a dozen times. Once the crashing is fixed, 5 stars from me."
"7298",923772792,"Absolutely fantastic. With all the variables brought on by different heroes, villains, and environments, the amount of unique combinations of play styles is colossal.  There are a few things that could be better, however. The app does occasionally crash, and though it always saves your progress, it’s still pretty annoying when it happens.  I would also like it if I could somehow save which expansions I’ve already purchased online so that I won’t have to buy them all over again if I ever switch to the Steam version."
"7299",923772792,"SotM is a superb translation of the card game, replicating the physical game experience near perfectly. The artwork is amazing. This app replaces the physical game for me in all ways. So why do I give it one star?  The game crashes more than a bind person going the wrong way on the interstate. Sure, it’s annoying, but as a person who has bought both Season 1 and 2 with all expansions, I should expect a game that’s stable. So long as this game crashes minimally 4 times per game, it can only get one star till it’s stability is fixed."
"7300",923814895,"Very fun game to play"
"7301",923814895,"Best single player three kingdoms game I have ever played on phone"
"7302",923814895,"Interesting game and cute hero"
"7303",923873989,"don’t waste your money on this. the app doesn’t save your videos."
"7304",923873989,"Doesn’t save to ur phone anymore"
"7305",923873989,"The app was working great for a couple first months then it stopped working. It doesn’t allow you to save photos or videos which make the whole thing useless!! I tried to update it; delete the app then redownload, turning my phone off then on again, update everything, still doesn’t work, even on the free version!! Wth man we pay to use the app please make it work again or please refund the money :/"
"7306",923917775,"I've been playing it for about 10 minutes and it's definitely a fun and cute game definitely worth the FREE download."
"7307",923917775,"This game is so fun and I really want to try and complete it!"
"7308",923917775,"This game honestly keeps me sane! All these cute kitties!!!"
"7309",923920872,"The app does not count steps right. It does not calculate rewards right. It often just wipes your steps taken in rewards calculation, tells you you don't have enough steps, or just tells you you already claimed the reward even though haven't. The app is a piece of junk."
"7310",923920872,"最近身体一直不太舒服，皮肤还有点过敏，通过app咨询医生，得到有效的建议身体好转，让我省去了去医院的时间和各种验血。"
"7311",923920872,"还不错，还可以免费问医生呀"
"7312",924058967,"One of our favorites, especially this time of year. Great update!"
"7313",924058967,"Our children love My Little Pony! The storybook was much longer than we anticipated, which was such a nice surprise. Super cute and funny too!!!"
"7314",924058967,"Super cute and scary fun for my little one! My six-year old loved the pumpkin toss and the Halloween - er - Nightmare Night theme where all of her favorite ponies were dressed up in costumes. When Luna hugged Fluttershy, my daughter laughed out loud at Fluttershy’s face. Nice to see some new characters too - Zecora and Luna. Another winner!"
"7315",924373886,"Best game u can ever play it so cool"
"7316",924373886,"😂"
"7317",924373886,"There are still bugs because every time I go in it turns me off the game so fix it"
"7318",924438909,"On my iPhone 6 the JPEG in settings is grayed out so will not shoot RAW. F stop is also locked at f2.2. Useless app for iPhone 6!"
"7319",924438909,"Strange bug still exists in latest build which - upon opening the app - raises the iPhone volume control when iPhone has volume level set to its lowest level (muted speakers). This has been present through the last several builds, including this latest one. Please fix this irritating bug."
"7320",924438909,"I’ve been using ProShot for just about everything but panos - and with the Xr, portraits - for several years now - having tried many many other camera apps. The UI/UX is simple and gets out of the way when I don’t want it, but I can opt for a lot of control when I want it.   I also have to say the developer has been open to feedback and some of the changes in v5.5 are a direct result of comments I made. Can’t ask for a whole lot more than that!"
"7321",924443754,"Really easy to use, nice lay out, fun to search for lots and lots of products. All around great app!"
"7322",924443754,"I can not figure out how to view my pinned shops. The mobile website is much easier to browser and navigate."
"7323",924443754,NA
"7324",924491991,"Recently got an update and playlists can’t be viewed. Also certain iCloud songs are missing. This is a common problem (stuff breaking) with this app. Worth 2 bucks I guess, I’m sure there’s better ones out there though.  -UPDATE- I just opened this app after over a year of not using it. Doesn’t seem buggy at all. I’m starting to use it again as my primary music player. Still a better graphical experience than the Music app"
"7325",924491991,"Cs Music player is fantastic. It's everything I want from a music player; gesture controls, big glorious album art to show off on now playing, customizable color themes, and more. Truly a step up from Apple's native music app, however there are just a features I prefer from Apple Music; a dedicated section for recently added items, grid view while browsing albums and the ability to view/manage your up next queue. If some of these could be implemented into a future version this app would be perfect! Please and thanks!"
"7326",924491991,"I love the Cesium app for its user interface, and the fact that you can customize it.  I also love the ability to change the star ratings of the current song.  However, when I open the app (after manually closing it) the Now Playing GUI doesn’t open. I would like it to open with the song and playlist that was open when I closed the app. And yes, I have it set to open automatically in the app settings. But it doesn’t happen."
"7327",924589795,"I played a lot of MMO(RPG)s, Habbo, Runescape, etc., but phew.. Those kids post some crazy things on their timelines. Borderline nudity if you ask me lol. This game needs to be 18+."
"7328",924589795,"I am not even getting notifications when someone texted"
"7329",924589795,"I love this game it’s really creative, you can trade, at first this was a little bit difficult for me but I have some practice and I’m good now so thanks for this game ❤️"
"7330",924620788,"I love this app because as a student I’m able to access this app easier than signing into my school google account. This is way more convenient!"
"7331",924620788,"I love that google classroom is able to be on my moms phone now but as a student, I need it to be able to type/edit and revise, so I can do my assignments on the go or when I don’t have internet. Just something to think about thanks bye!❤️"
"7332",924620788,"Yes,I am a 7th grade student writing this since I am at home and I need to sign in and enter the codes for my classes,but my gmail and password can’t work. Please fix this problem. Thanks for writing this,hope it helped,please check out my YouTube channel “DartMart” Thank you"
"7333",924635678,"It is difficult to find how to save your videos to your device. Features that are most commonly used should be easily accessible."
"7334",924635678,"It’s the best!"
"7335",924635678,"great app really love it"
"7336",924695435,"The only reason I gave it two stars is that it looks pretty.  What happened to all the tools.  One GLARING absence is THER IS NO LASSO.  What the frak?  I wasted money on this and it is basically useless to me.  Most of the tools won’t work, either.  What has happened to these apps?  They want to make everything so preset that a professional artist is allowed a basically dumbed down program for the selfies generation."
"7337",924695435,"Doesn’t warp, skew, or alter a layer’s perspective. I bought this because I love the desktop app and thought this would do it too. I’m now $5 poorer and have to spend another $2 on a separate app that does this very simple, common thing."
"7338",924695435,"Dude, this app does a lot of really cool things that I need and I appreciate it for that but the user interface truly makes me want to scream."
"7339",924826403,"It's very clear this game was designed around a touch screen, rather than fight the medium this game embraces it. Combined with the beautiful art and elegant story it makes the game a real masterpiece."
"7340",924826403,"The art and music are beautiful and the gameplay is solid. Top notch"
"7341",924826403,"Sometimes a slash just doesn't break a sword and its really frustrating when slashes high or low on the screen bring up your iPhone menus."
"7342",925056174,"Best app I’ve found for local current conditions, and especially imminent precipitation or incoming severe weather."
"7343",925056174,"I got this one to use with my Garman watch And after numerous attempts I still cannot get it to work otherwise OK"
"7344",925056174,"So the app is wondee-& it can also predict the weather but can I get a little sunshine please. It’s been raining for weeks on end."
"7345",925201227,"But when i watch a video the game crashes please fix but this is the BEST app ever"
"7346",925201227,"If it is then I certainly do . I love this game it so fun and the mini movies that are pre programmed in the are cute too. I wish could give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ thank you so much for making this app my daughter likes it too.

"7347",925201227,"I put it 5 stars cause it kinda kicks me out. But I can make stories I can make. I will not delete the game cause I like the pic. I have that!!!!! Very cool game and very cute! 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍 love it!"
"7348",925338276,"This is the most ridiculously developed app I have ever used. I do all my banking on line and pay all my credit cards with apps and it’s usually extremely easy. This app just doesn’t even work."
"7349",925338276,"Like this store"
"7350",925338276,"Odioooo! Que no tengan autopay como en otras tiendas, parece que lo hacen mas complicado para que uno falle sus pagos, cuando todas las tiendas ya cuentan con ese servicio, los cupones son difíciles de usar en el app! Y sus cobros por envíos son exagerados, ya ni porque uno es platinum. Necesitan tener mejor servicio al cliente online!!!!"
"7351",925494667,"I love Flipline Studios games I play them on Cool Math all the time.The problem I’m having is the quality.I believe HD is way better then the to go,because it doesn’t say what is true.I even wasted 16 bucks on all the games to get my dad to buy all the games for me.The reason why I didn’t get HD was because of all the money it would coast me.Also Flipline studios should come out with a vegetarian game.They should also but the sushiria game on the iPads as well."
"7352",925494667,"Very fun game to play."
"7353",925494667,"There isn’t much to the game. It really shouldn’t have cost any money. I would suggest spending your money somewhere else."
"7354",925547937,"Just downloaded the latest update. Glad to see it still gets attention. Question: on the routes, what is the last one? It’s completely in Japanese, and doesn’t really do anything when you select it. Is that supposed to be a new route?"
"7355",925547937,"This game is the most best Train simulator on ios and this game is not a waste of your money"
"7356",925547937,"Always wanted to be a train operator and this is by far the best train simulator game I’ve ever seen or played in my life would be nice to have a train operator view and maybe some customers waiting at the stations but would def love to drive my own A train line in NYC lol"
"7357",925770322,"Great game it’s sound design is amazing I like how there’s two difficulty levels for people who like to enjoy a game and for people who like a challenge 10/10 great game"
"7358",925770322,"I’ve played this game maybe 4 times through and I still get stuck in some spots. This is a really hard game but worth the energy. When will they come out with the third? I’d love to see what they come up with"
"7359",925770322,"Some puzzles are just an exercise in frustration. The colored balls for instance. I play a lot of these games and was enjoying this one until I stopped having fun and realized how frustrated I was becoming. PLEASE OFFER A SKIP BUTTON!"
"7360",925838610,"This app did nothing and I think they paid for the good reviews but when I played it there was nothing but complete silence no shock either"
"7361",925838610,"This app almost broke my phone do not get this"
"7362",925838610,"i thought it shocks u but no it was so boring"
"7363",926058555,"I used this app to book movie tickets for my AMC Stubs account. It’s so good and fast, that I don’t remember booking through it. The experience is seamless, app has a clean UI, no crashes and the checkout was a breeze."
"7364",926058555,"It happened to me and my boyfriend. Our tickets were purchased & when we got to the movies they tickets were actually purchased by fandango by someone else!!! & they immediately refunded me which I didn’t even want I wanted them to give me another date ! Smh"
"7365",926058555,"No full refund anymore unless it’s atom cash."
"7366",926105977,"Just a fyi for anyone else who can't or don't use ad-supported apps."
"7367",926105977,"One of the best  But wished it had a way to delete all tabs"
"7368",926105977,"Great one handed browser with Touch ID."
"7369",926159169,"Stupid. Can’t login into the app. Keeps giving a stupid error msg"
"7370",926159169,"I would give this app two starts because all this year it would keep logging me out of the app and saying i had to pay a yearly fee. Also now I can’t login to the app at all because it keeps saying login error and it has done this before in the past. Overall this app is frustrating and has a lot of technical issues that need to be fixed."
"7371",926159169,"I paid $4 for an app that doesn’t work and emailed creator with no response. My granddaughter wanted to see her GPA for the year. Very dissatisfied!"
"7372",926366251,"So  amazing 😱 so my elf’s got me my elf pets reindeer and they named her Mistletoe 🦌🎄 very fun bye! (Also they are my favorite animal 💗🦌)"
"7373",926366251,"I love how in this game you can do many different things to earn badges and I also like how this app lets you play a few fun games and lets you take care of your reindeer in different and fun ways. I would play this game over and over again because of all the fun it has!!!🤶🎅🌲🎄🐾💫⭐️🌟✨⚡️💥"
"7374",926366251,"I love this game it has so many fun things you can do with your pet raindeer"
"7375",926541293,"Happiness? Fulfilled. Goals? Achieved. Graphs? Modeled. Wig? Snatched.  Hotel? Trivago."
"7376",926541293,"Phil Swift’s review was right"
"7377",926541293,"This is the greatest accomplishment of the American people. It is like if Dolan Tramph solved world hunger. This actually has the potential to make America great again. 50/10 this can solve diseases and the people that say mElk instead of milk. Elon Musk went higher than mars using this app. Moth got its lamp from this app. Thanos got his car using this app. Better than the tictoc app. It solved forknife depression and people who do forknife dances IRL."
"7378",927006017,"Portrait mode makes this game much less enjoyable. Why should I constantly scroll up and down just to see everything? Will be deleting this app soon if landscape mode isn’t made available again. I will not be playing, but will be checking back periodically to see if landscape mode is available. You are going to lose a lot of mobile players if you force portrait... My rating will change to 5 stars if landscape mode comes back! This is my first review to ever write and it is only because of the horrible decision to force portrait mode"
"7379",927006017,"Without landscape, game is too hard to play."
"7380",927006017,"Need landscape or I will not play. How can they think that we would want to SCROLL to see the whole interface? I’ve never used portrait mode with this game and don’t even know how to play it that way. Hate the update, and done unless landscape is put back."
"7381",927060395,"Great game, always liked playing Monopoly as a kid!!"
"7382",927060395,"Great and skillful game"
"7383",927060395,"I have logged into this app with my Facebook account and I can’t get back to where I was,it takes me back to the beginning"
"7384",927117171,"These “DONT HATE” post are a bunch of nut loving bots.   I played football heroes 2015 and it was really fun to play. At first I didn’t purchase anything with actual money because it wasn’t needed for half of the campaigns. And when I did purchase some packs I had awesome gold players. That was to make the game a lot more fun. The problem with this game is you start out with default (weak) players which is understandable. What I don’t get is why the campaign is so pop sided with what seems extremely op AI’s in the rookie league. This game basically tells me to spend $$$ right off the back.. if you can’t put two and two together maybe you guys need to re-evaluate the level difficulty’s so that way nobody gets frustratingly ticked off why a 10mill dollar team is dominating a 2.7 mill dollar team. Get your heads out your greedy axes and try to gain more players by not making the game so demanding of $$ for better play makers."
"7385",927117171,"I want to give this game 5 stars, it’s a awesome game, but l used my OWN money to buy a QB and it states before you buy it the QBs you could get and it’s like Peyton Manning,Andrew Luck,Tom Brady, and Aaron Rodgers who are all pro bowl guys. I bought a new QB thinking it was one of them and I got I MICHAEL FLYNN he isn’t even in the NFL now.I also bought a new wideout and also got ripped off.I would totally rate this five stars but this is unacceptable. You can’t just rip people off like this."
"7386",927117171,"Pro 16 has some bad lags. I don’t think you should get it. Some times it does not recognize what you touch and does not work. I was playing and my guy did not move and I lost the game. Don’t get it!"
"7387",927568927,"I cant even download the app....please fix this as I have wanted to play this game for a long time"
"7388",927568927,"I love the 'Fear for Sale' games. This one, however, stopped at 81% progress TWICE (The end of Chapter 5) and doesn't not allow you to go past that.  Needs fixing!!"
"7389",927568927,"All the fear for sale games are GREAT!!!!!"
"7390",927823151,"What’s going on with this app!  I used to love the original app; much better pictures. Now I can’t even get my photos to save.  Please help!"
"7391",927823151,"I can’t find my photos. I took a trip to Yellowstone and got some amazing shots and now I cannot find them. They’re not in my photo library and I can’t find them in the ap. I wrote to them 3 weeks ago but haven’t gotten a reply. Totally bummed. One star cause support is non existent."
"7392",927823151,"This one only takes a single shot. When it combines multiple photos already taken (it cannot take multiple shots), it creates a less vibrant HDR than the older version.  All apps that claim they are HDR and not take 2-3 shots are fake and lie to you.  This app should be removed from app store and refunds given.  The developer is gone as well, you have no one to ask for support!  Rest in peace the old Pro HDR app, the true and only one that took separate shots at different exposures!"

My concern came when I saw a business used to process some of our information. It was a foreign name (non-English characters) and the site was impossible to read! Even if I email them to opt me out of marketing, it seems this country will have access to my information. Not only that, the website connection is not secure (snooping & such possible with my connection info). Who are these people and how are they affiliated with our information?   As much as I love the layout, legality & contract terms sometimes aren’t easily & fully understood by me. Especially when their sites are a foreign language. Www.its.by is the site I couldn’t understand. Russian?   Anyways, I’ll have to wait until I have more time to contact the game creators via support email.  This game looks entertaining and the reviews are enticing."

"7409",929302239,"Good for all"
"7410",929302239,"I kept failing without a clue why. Sometimes I would randomly make it farther.   There is definitely a delay in its detection of presses. I have an iPhone 6 with the latest patch 10.3.3. Maybe the delay is a side effect."
"7411",929346489,"Ok"
"7412",929346489,"Omg guys I love this!!!"
"7413",929346489,"Dumb ways 2 is a fun game, that’s for sure but there were a small amount of problems. Like one time, there was an update, saying that they would make some improvements for better gameplay but once I tried that update, they didn’t really fix much stuff and actually made some stuff WORSE. So yeah, I love this app, just needs a little work."
"7414",930304174,"No point, I mean if you want to spend 20 minutes clicking away for a sub par story and some B class graphics, waste your money.   The app store shouldn't even be allowed to sell this trash."
"7415",930304174,"I saw this on Instagram and downloaded it right away, let me tell you its really scary! The doll does things and she gives me goosebumps!"
"7416",930304174,"This app is great the story is very creepy. Perfect game to play when u just want to be scared! Get it 😱"
"7417",930350602,"Very good mobile game"
"7418",930350602,"I don't know what's happening. I'm on superstar 1 and ive been trying to play 5th match and game just gets stuck. I can play other matches like legends. But not regular ? Wth. Can you fix it please thank you"
"7419",930350602,"Very good."
"7420",930368978,"China has blocked zoom.  We then are forced to us this not so user friendly app.  There is Chinese characters in the app.  Also I am afraid all the conversations are monitored"
"7421",930368978,"Unless you own employees and want to whip these poor slaves."
"7422",930368978,"I expect this application to have all its user experience in the language selected by the user. You have plenty of resources to make this happen.  The suggestion that I belong to a Chinese group is disingenuous. I’m an English speaking user who wants to read my UX in English.   Let’s have a really SERIOUS conversation!"
"7423",930441707,"Excellent app"
"7424",930441707,"It gives me no option to say if im interested in men or women its stupid just goes to men"
"7425",930441707,"This app has turned crappy. It's so slow. I paid for subscription and it's not activating. I've emailed twice with no response."
"7426",930574573,"Just like all other “free” games, there’s ads and chances to earn diamonds by watching videos.....however once you get to 860 diamonds and keep watching videos to get more, it doesn’t give you any. Can’t find an email for the developer and I refuse to create a Facebook account to try and contact them that way"
"7427",930574573,"Look out Democrat’s this game maybe to intens for Cry Babies"
"7428",930574573,"Love it"
"7429",930868205,"Totally worth the 2 dollars. Me and my little brother used to play this game all the time on the computer. Got so excited when I heard a mobile version came out. This game has no bugs, It’s entertaining, and it’s not just a play it once then your done game. You definitely get your 2$ out of it."
"7430",930868205,"You have made it clear that this game is one of your best! I really want you to make more though. There is this one glitch were the children will stay in place but still walk in place. It’s weird. Please fix"
"7431",930868205,"Haunt the house punches me with nostalgia, and happiness."
"7432",931337752,"I just wish I could read Japanese or there was a English version then I could have gave you 5 stars"
"7433",931337752,"Can you please apply the English translation of this game (which is now available on PS4) to the app??? I’d really like to play it in English."
"7434",931337752,"It’s pretty easy to follow, been playing for about 2 years and I don’t know Japanese.  It’s pretty fair in the gacha, as it rotates regularly sometimes it’s smarter to just wait for the guaranteed 5star.  Some of the challenge stages are near impossible, they’re almost set up to make you fail, but their still fun when you’re finally able to pull it off after months of prep."
"7435",932191687,"I feel very disappointed, I have Module and Ivory, but I bought American D, and only use Dark Piano, and it seems in last update it is not the same samples, what have change? It is unfair."
"7436",932191687,"NOT ENOUGH VOLUMETO USE LIVE OR PRACTICE. IT HAS BECOME A TOY LIKE ALL OF THEM."
"7437",932191687,"This just has the best grand piano sound for the money. You could go to a music store and pay a lot more for a physical sound module that might, just might, maybe sound almost as good as this one."
"7438",932228293,"When I say “non-predatory”, I mean that the game doesn’t shove in-app purchases down your throat. It’s easy to pick up and play, and I can see myself paying for no adds. It’s fun, it’s challenging, and I would definitely recommend giving Train Conductor World a spin."
"7439",932228293,"STILL CRASHES ON LOADING"
"7440",932228293,"It’s 5:54 in the mornin and it won’t work because when I tap the screen it just puts me back on the main screen of my tablet. If it’s something wrong with my tab I can let it slide. But if it’s the game then I’m given it a4 💎 wait a poop I put a diminn emoji instead of a star. Whelp see ya on the other side"
"7441",932236332,"It is my one of favorite games. It is very interesting approach to teach how to think logically. This app tried to deliver the basic concepts that kids should know and learn easily without any difficulties. Moreover, beautiful graphics promoted more kids’ interest on this game. My son really loves this app. Whenever having a free time, he enjoys this.  Down and play it. Never stop playing!!!!"
"7442",932236332,"My preschooler loved it!"
"7443",932236332,"Another great app by the developer! Todo math is our fav app and my son loved their mini game called Matrix! Now they made it as a stand alone app. It looks like simple educational app but  it encourages my son to pause and think what block to go to correct spot! Great app for simple number games to all the way to fraction!"
"7444",932248553,"Lovely paper art style with relaxing music backdrop a game where milliseconds make the difference between success and horrible jet pack crash. And you will crash. Repeatedly. Because gravity, momentum, and the frailness of the human body are your greatest adversaries, not to mention the how off-balance you are. The simple two-thumb controls are as intuitive as your pack is unwieldy, and the game pushes you to fly through a series of timed challenges that steadily but fairly increase in difficulty through the campaign. After each failure, you can retry instantly, and the cycle of repeated attempts lulls you into a zen-like state as you slowly improve. This is a game that is difficult to learn and perhaps impossible to master, but easy to keep playing after each failure, because you know you need just one more chance. Or two. Or fifty."
"7445",932248553,"I had a lot of fun but it’s a little hard to control but that’s it"
"7446",932248553,"This game isn’t necessarily a bad game a like to play it a lot. It’s just some things that need fixing, for example the birds in the pier there is way to many birds and the hit your character causing some wierd movements. Also, sometimes the water and above cloud missions will be wierd because I clip the water and clip above the clouds and it won’t give me the check.So this game is really good but just need some minor fixes."
"7447",932315244,"I love it it is amazing but I’m not happy because I want all the nhl city’s in the game and I want more updates i have done everything but besides that so fun and can you make stick baseball please please please please"
"7448",932315244,"I love NHL and I love the game one thing like a bunch of other games I think you should be able to take a picture of the logos and change it but I love the game if you like the NHL then you will love the game"
"7449",932315244,"Was fun until the last few days, now there’s a huge add across the top of the screen making playing useless and frustrating.  BTW: annoying the hell out of me with obnoxious adds makes me NOT purchase the product... it actually makes me stay away from the product!!"
"7450",932389062,"mile the rule"
"7451",932389062,"I’ve had this game for quite some time. While it is addicting and fun to play, it can be highly frustrating to get far into a level only for the tap to not recognize and fail you. Also, the daily challenges are completely inconsistent with the coins received. I’ve tracked and some days are spot-on 150, but mostly I’ve received 120-130 coins. Why say you’re getting 150, when in reality, you don’t?   Several bugs make the game frustrating.   Thank you for developing a game that is fun, but work on making it better."
"7452",932389062,"I really do enjoy this game, it’s sort of similar to geometry dash. I just have one thing, sometimes when you jump I wish the music was exactly on beat I guess but other than that I love this app!"
"7453",932441611,"This game is fun"
"7454",932441611,"Great way to kill some time compared to a lot of the garbage out there. And if you want to make some in-app purchases to speed up your progress it’s not unreasonable. My only criticism is that this game is ready for an upgrade. New cityscapes, trucks (conventional vs cabover), equipment, and jobs would keep it interesting and fun. But all in all a good game—no worries with this one!"
"7455",932441611,"I would love to have American trucks like the one in construction simulator 2 but I want the ones from there and a Mack superliner and Chevy bison with an off-road and free map off-road,spring,and winter with regular cars and pickup trucks hope to see updates thanks"
"7456",932463620,"I'm a dawg hoo can tipe so letme say this's fun but some of the dawgs caust to much lower the prices pleeez thix!!!!! Also get thiss, make the gems easier to get, and all rate 5 stars and gett another game you made 🐕🐩🐕🐩🐕🐩🐕"
"7457",932463620,"I love this game but can you please add the German Shepard less it is my fav dog and I wanna get it but it’s good and funny"
"7458",932463620,"Such a great game! This game is a great mix of cute and fun! U can chose ur puppy or it’s accessories!♥️ when I play this game I take time out of my day to play. A special shout-out to the creator(s)! Thanks sooooo much 4 making this game! Love y’all"
"7459",932500451,"Game content is decent at best, but their support system is the true downfall. You make a purchase in game, only have the game invite some sort of bug that prevents you from being able to use the contents of the purchase. Then a blanket “gift” gets sent the entire community (even those who did not make purchases or get affected by the bug). So, you are out the money you spent to get ahead of the competition and you somehow ended up falling behind the completion."
"7460",932500451,"I can't even play the game it goes to my home screen when I try to play it I recommend playing Injustice gods among us it is much smoother running"
"7461",932500451,"Love the game needs a way to connect through Facebook or something"
"7462",932747118,"超级好用哦哦哦！！！必须评论啦啦、网购了这么多年，这是我第一次这么认真的对待。我怀着忐忑的心情拿着手机盯着屏幕，迟迟不敢下手。我怕我一旦说出来，老板会觉得我在拍马屁，是不是想为了那几块钱的红包，又怕我的评价会误导后来的网友。为了写这次评价，我鼓起勇气喝了3瓶啤酒才有信心。记得第一次喝酒还是对初恋表白的那天，今天又是同样的心情，拼了，为了不辜负老板对我的期望，我一定会客观，公正，如实的写下自己的评价：这是我这开心的一次网购，谢谢！！！"

"7464",932747118,"收拾打扮打扮的时刻讲呢被"
"7465",932779605,"The game has no real online play. There are several reasons why this is true.. which I covered in my last post. For some reason I can’t find it. Please explain why the game is advertised as fighting players around the world online... and yet it isn’t true. Why can I knock people out so easily? This game is soooo easy... for those of you who say it’s hard.. stop playin games.. seriously. This game would be soooo much better if I could fight against actual people!!! So much better. If that were the case, it’s probably the only game I’d play. So developers, either fix the online mode and make it real. Or change the description of the game to “simulated online play.” Sigh"
"7466",932779605,"I hate  graffics I like the game but don’t get mad at me it is totally hard maybe you like it but don’t like it that’s why I gave it a one star never download a Moran game dumb company"
"7467",932779605,"Another fun game from the unreal game system."
"7468",932828299,"I remember that he said HE SAID GO NOGGIN!"
"7469",932828299,"I purchased Noggin recently and loaded the App on my Apple TV so that my daughter could watch videos. It worked great at first but every two to three days, it seems to delete my account and wants me to go to the “activate noggin” website and put in a code. When I try this, it tells me I already have an account and that I need to login. When I try to login, it tells me I need to put in a code to activate the Noggin app again. I just go around in circles!  I ended up having to delete the app, reinstall it, and login again. I wish this could be fixed because I am tired of having to do this over and over again!"
"7470",932828299,"The app seems pretty great except I can’t cast the show to my tv."
"7471",933135994,"Yea"
"7472",933135994,"This is a great game! My question is what are the “Standard Akinator Badges” for?"
"7473",933135994,"I used to love this game when I was younger and my friend recently reminded me that it existed.  I was flooded with nostalgia of the hours I would spend on this game trying to find the most obscure characters I could think of. I returned and tried to relive my glory days and picked a random NPC from Skyrim and decided to look for him. I began answering questions and saw as the questions got closer and closer to my character... but then once I answered the last question I was met with a screen reading “this is a VIP character” meaning that I would either have to pay or watch an ad in order to see the character... why? Why do I have to pay in order to play 20 questions with a genie?"
"7474",933189224,"Why is it better to have the character run around automatically as opposed to being fully controlled with the freedom to walk when and what direction you want? You made this game about boring timing and not exciting exploring."
"7475",933189224,"Controls are easy enough, looks great on my tv, creative, and challenging enough to be a lot of fun."
"7476",933189224,"Love this.  Have gotten so tired of all the games with IAP's and leveling up your character.  This is a simple game with beautiful graphics and great soundtrack that I find incredibly fun to play and don't have to spend hours playing.  Work of art."
"7477",933199580,"Not fare I can't download the game ........ Where my MONEY"
"7478",933199580,"This little gem has slipped down a slope of controversial loss of support. People see the beauty in it and cry about how they want more and since they aren't getting it, they berate this great game. Does it have flaws? Sure. Is it still boldly beautiful? Absolutely.   But here's the thing, wanna know why there's lack of bug fixing? Because as the developers were working on finishing it, the terror attacks in Paris of late 2015 occurred and affected this studios' people. That's right, put two and two together and you'll realize from their forum posts that they didn't have the capabilities to overcome what happened right after the first few patches of this game.  Are the controls tight? Sometimes a little too tight. They need to include a walk through because there are features of the game with no instruction. Like: you have to go back to town and talk to your Captain to change party members. But the end of this game has a trailer for what they hoped would be the rest of the story. And it leaves me thirsty for more. I'd say to people who want to still try it, know you're going in on a game that had a tragic loss regarding its development. Post to their forums and let them know what you like and don't like. But for all the work that was put into it, I'll give them 4 stars for what could have been the greatest Indy rpg on the App Store."
"7479",933199580,"Lack of support now from devs as they shut down studio"
"7480",933462805,"When I found this game it said “be the monster” and described getting to be the beast for once, facing off against warriors, destroying things. This is an outright LIE. Aside from decent graphics, this is a very generic, boring game, there is no story. It’s constant boss fight after boss fight, no substance or options or customization. It’s disappointing, bland and unless you like fight after fight with the SAME monster over and over and OVER again, it’s not worth your time."
"7481",933462805,"It simple and easy to understand and gameplay play smooth and I wish there more characters but it still cool"
"7482",933462805,"It seems that the devs abandoned this game. You cannot upgrade your character other then level even though the weapons and other upgrades say available later. There are only 5 monsters who continue to get recycled... what is this? I want my money back"
"7483",933471941,"Can anyone tell me how I get a person to ride my back? 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 for the game"
"7484",933471941,"I really like this game, this was the first Gluten Free Games’ game I ever got! But can it be a bit more...realistic like Jungle Sim or Dragon Sim? And why can we not pounce while in the air? And why can’t we pick up our food? Plus, when we bond, I think we should get to level 5, and when we do bond we should need to do...like... 3 roars... please fix this!"

"7490",934003228,"I'm in love with the overall game and have spent many hours on it but when I got to mission 30 or so, the game started to crash unexpectedly. Hopefully there'll be an update soon to patch that, so it can get the 5 stars it deserves"
"7491",934003228,"Will crash mid game and cause loss of progress. Happens constantly"
"7492",934030757,"It literally logged me out and will not allow me to sign back in. I continue to get an error message saying “request failed. Please try again later”. I called customer service and they are unable to reset the password, telling me it will take up to 24-72 hours for them to send in a reset password request.  Customer service is trash as well!"

Called cust service and twitter support they didn’t help. Years of maintaining platinum accts, spent a lot of money and effort and I didn’t feel I was valued customer"
"7495",934390663,"I’ve had this app for several years and thoroughly enjoyed everything about it. The artwork is especially pleasing and the hidden objects and puzzles add a great element to the story. I very seldom buy a game or in app purchases and kept putting off the inevitable purchase of the remaining books. I played thru the first two books a couple of times and each time decided I liked it enough to break my rule. But It wasn’t until my 5 yr old granddaughter got interested enough to actually play the game and needed my help that I finally bought the remaining 4 books. She is so excited, as am I, that we can continue this adventure!   Imagine my frustration as she skipped happily away to her Princess Tent to open book 3, and I picked up my iPad to start over from the beginning and play clear through the whole series, only to find that my purchase of the last 4 books is not recognized!! What’s up with that?? I can’t find a place to tell the app that I already purchased them! What kind of a rip off is happening here?"
"7496",934390663,"I was like “I need Escape from Weirdwood Manor !” But when I looked in the AppStore I couldn’t find it! And the last book ends saying” He couldn’t believe his eyes or something like that .

"7498",934510730,"I used to struggle when I was drawing on the computer I always thought it would be awesome to attach my iPad to the computer and use it to draw! This app works great!"
"7499",934510730,"Best app ever since the beta version I got to test out I have been happy growing with the new versions and new IPad version. I came from using a Wacom tablet vs a mouse and this app is just amazing!!! Love what they are doing keep it up. Thank you for helping us do what we do!"
"7500",934510730,"Thanks to this program I didn’t have to buy a graphics tablet to create comics. I have a program that I use that would need a graphics tablet for me to draw. So I thought there is no way I can use my iPad with my Apple Pencil without exporting and importing which I did not want to do. After some research this program popped up. Man it is great! Even over WiFi it works wonders for me. I love it and it is perfectly what I was looking for. Now I can use the program to create comics and not spend more money buying a graphics tablet."
"7501",934540991,"This game doesn't work anymore."
"7502",934540991,"I love this app. My 2 year old loves it. There is a section with bouncing balls that once you place them, the option to place the same colored ball disappears. Please do the same with the animated stickers. We don’t need ten Scouts or Riders all over the screen. One of each character is quite enough. I know they can be erased, but that’s a bit harder for her to figure out. If you make this change, I will give five stars."
"7503",934540991,"This app won't load past the initial screen."
"7504",934596429,"Game started out great in 2015 and then developer greed turned it into a money pit. Had an awesome CP dominating alliance that was completely wiped out by the insane pricing. None of us could afford to play anymore.  You will spend hours clicking through endless trees of research that wastes hours of your time. The instant research is mostly broken.  Still not convinced? Then throw away your cash and get ready to waste a lot of your time trying to open thousands of Collectables 1 at a time. Dance Monkey! Dance!  The bad 1 star reviews are finally in the lead. Game deserves them."
"7505",934596429,"Good"
"7506",934596429,"Game is fun unless you can’t afford a pack. There is a way to fix this. Please allow alliances to send all resources T5 and T6 included. That would help tremendously from discouraging players that continue to get hit by much larger bases. If it’s an alliance we should be able to send whatever we have to our teammates! Fix this please. Thank you"
"7507",935216956,"This is a really REALLY good game, I love papers please and it’s an inspiring game to play. I love the mechanics and creativity that was put into this game and all in all I say it’s a 5 star rating"

"7509",935216956,"One of the best game ever"
"7510",935248296,"I had been very close to deleting this game from my iPad, but I am glad I didn’t because the publisher finally released an update that fixes the infamous ""assault bug"" where both sides would roll sixes every time in close combat. This bug had essentially broke the game since close combat is not only frequent but it also is often game-deciding. As an app publisher myself I was completely mystified why anyone would publish a game of this caliber and then completely abandon it without so much as a bug fix update for over a year. Even if it didn’t sell well, a bug-fix for something as egregious as the assault bug would have been a minimal common courtesy for those who did purchase the game I order to make it playable for them. I’m rating it 4 stars instead of 5 mostly because while the game itself is excellent, I can’t rate it 5 stars given the lack of service the publisher has shown so far. I will reevaluate that rating in the future if this update marks a renewed commitment to this title by the publisher."
"7511",935248296,"Fix the assault auto if a 6 die and I’ll leave 5 stars."
"7512",935248296,"but you REALLY need to fix the bug where in assault both parties throw a 6 in the first roll, everytime. It is unacceptable for a boardgame, and I can’t see how it would be hard to fix.  The rest of the game is very nice, well done, very fun."
"7513",935306292,"It does sync steps with Health, but at least some third parties that track steps (Pokemon Go, Vitality) don’t recognize the total."

Been playing for over 4 years and recently picked up the PC version and have already hit 12th place globally with less than 150 hours in it. Every time I hit a milestone it is a huge satisfaction. This game has almost taken as much time of my life as Geometry Dash and I have 4000 hours+ in that game over 6 years. Basically this is my favorite game and I will never stop playing. My ONLY problem is “I love my motorbike” I hate that song with a passion. It belongs on a moms Facebook not in a professional grade rhythm game. I don’t care who’s children they are and how much money was given to have it placed there. But the rant is done and despite me having a problem with the game it stays 5 stars because one mistake is not worth overshadowing the rest of this beautiful game. Love you devs keep up the good work!!"
"7519",935559685,"How do I get a refund? If you are a left handed golfer DO NOT PURCHASE. There is no left handed option for a video. WTH do lefty golfer always get the raw end of the deal!"
"7520",935559685,"There does not seem to be a way to import videos, or it's not intuitive to figure out how to do so. A message appears that says ""videos captured outside of the app may not be optimal."" Giving rise to the assumption that the app has this ability. Here's the thing, I auto swing capture using a ZEPP sensor with a tripod set up usually at the range or at the course.  So not being able to import the videos is a huge disappointment."
"7521",935559685,"How do I import a video into the library from my camera roll?"
"7522",935566920,"One time on this game I was swimming in the ocean 🌊 when some ice hit me there was a entrance I went into it I looked through the ice there was a giant squid 🦑 and a mosasaurus  and others some how I got into the water  💦 they battled me i defeated them I got a chest it was cool.           Sorry for forgetting the periods in there"
"7523",935566920,"This game is so awesome no glitches no inappropriate anything and lots of fun"
"7524",935566920,"I love this game so much, but it says it needs to be updated by the developer for iOS 11"
"7525",935623257,"Tamam gözüm 👍"

"7528",935697665,"One of the best VR coasters I’ve seen ever!!!"
"7529",935697665,"They didn’t ask you to pay for it right away you got five or six rides. However you only really needed two rides since it was a circular track and the ride only lasted about a minute. Otherwise good quality of ride. Check out if you have free time. Works great with Google Cardboard not blurry at all. Google Cardboard is a type of btw so you don’t have to by the real thing. I use merge vr and it works great!! 👍🏻"
"7530",935697665,"The coaster was fun, but the trial was bad"
"7531",935754064,"It lags and sticks and is terrible. Much better off using the iPad and Mac separately in multitasking"
"7532",935754064,"This app defies the planned obsolescence - giving iOS 9-era devices the ability to live on. Mojave hardware acceleration resolves my past issues. I still think the Sidecar pressure would motivate me to work on an Android version - many OEMs there block DP Alt Mode."
"7533",935754064,"Wireless connection doesn’t work"
"7534",936749679,"... except better. Controls are easier and falling diamonds don't kill you.  If you liked this back in the 80's you will love it now."

Ok, please do it. You got it yet, huh? I hope you did. Ok, goodbye until the next review of the next game I have or want my mom to download or a game that is not on this IPad. And I still don’t know what kowtowing is."
"7541",936966605,"I love this game just one problem the robot's battery drains to fast really I put 2 umbrellas and 2 propellers and it drained in a minute and a half! Can you please make the battery last longer?"

"7548",937236311,"This app is amazing. With this app you can easily customize your keyboard. There are many cool keyboards to choose from! They work perfectly! My keyboard is cool and unique now. It’s a great app and is very easy to use. I recommend this app for everyone. I think all of you should try this app. I love it! You guys are so awesome to make such a great app.  I hope you will keep up the good work."

"7550",937255144,"PLEASE add more TRUCKS AND TRACTORS OLD AND NEW ONES PLEASE AND THANK YOU."
"7551",937255144,"I love the game it is the best truck pulling game ever developers just add in some more cars for each class and a make your own car also maybe more tracks and sleds and must make it to were you can drive to the next track and put your truck/tracker in your trailer buy semi and semi trailers."

"7555",937261650,"I binged over 400 levels.  Just coming up for air so I can review it!"
"7556",937261650,"Great game at first, then the levels start repeating and of course they’re not the easy ones. Now this doesn’t happen until your up there around level 600 or so, so enjoy while you can."
"7557",937261650,"I’ve been having an ad pop up during the game over & over again. So I paid to remove ads & this one ad is still popping up every 30 to 60 seconds. It’s impossible to play the game now & infuriating that I paid for this.    Seller if you see this review please contact me so you can fix this."
"7558",937289819,"The aspects are great but you can’t resize photos to fit the aspect ratio. Your picture has to be tiny because will not fit to frame or you’ll have parts of the photos that are chopped off. Even if you change aspects there is no perfectly square aspects one on top of the other.  Other than that it’s okay."
"7559",937289819,"This app is very useful. I have made many collages. Without this app I couldn't have made all those collages."
"7560",937289819,"PRO'S ~ You give a lot of frames CON'S ~ You don't give any information like safe to photo gallery! Are you show is for vertical lines I click it and it makes a sound but I have no idea where the picture went...very confusing...please make it easier and add a ""Gallery"" thanks for listening 😊"
"7561",937718942,"I love this game but for the last two days I have been unable to play. It won't open. I've tried my phone and my iPad. Please help!"
"7562",937718942,"Please fix whatever it’s going on with this app. It’s really annoying."
"7563",937718942,"Reddgfhbbmejn. Ehsjt nd"
"7564",937737946,"I loved it"
"7565",937737946,"Many games in one"
"7566",937737946,"Impossible to pass the 4 coconut puzzle"
"7567",937793199,"Would love to see this app updated with the new oils, updated valor ingredients. Many oils missing.  Maybe add supplements, that would be a plus."
"7568",937793199,"So I love this app, I used daily for a LONG time, however many of the formulations for the oil blends are extremely out of date. As in those formulas haven’t been made in YEARS"
"7569",937793199,"This app used to be great when it first came out. Now it crashes and goes to a black screen every time it is opened. I have even tried deleting it and downloading it again. It has been doing this for about a year and still no updates to fix it."
"7570",937922348,"I love the game but we need more features I’ve seen almost no changes from when I first played the game probably 3 years ago. I would love a trading option, or a pack that I could buy for coins because I don’t want to spend my cash. More packs in general would be nice, and a bit more to do with friends"
"7571",937922348,"This game is pretty fun but I wish they had an actual season mode,and please make the card packs cheaper."
"7572",937922348,"So I’ve played this for a while have a 90 rated team and I can’t handle this anymore.Losing to a 54 rated 24-0 that is absolutely pathetic.I would say try this game but it’s absolutely shockingly bad.So if you try this don’t expect anything decent."
"7573",937976391,"App crashes every time we click play. We’ve tried every category and the same thing happens. Deleted app and restored it. Updated iOS. Reset phone. Nothing has worked."
"7574",937976391,"I love this game because it teaches your kids all the different species, animals, and hats! And it’s totally free!!!! And it keeps your kids company. And it teaches them to listen to their teammate/s. And use their noggin."
"7575",937976391,"The app is really great but For some weird reason, I can’t make a in-app purchase! This really triggers me"
"7576",937988895,"This is the best game ever"
"7577",937988895,"I love the graphics only problem I had nothing was working no matter how many times I pressed it ! lol still cool tho."
"7578",937988895,"It looked like a fun game so I downloaded it but, when I opened it, none of the controls worked. I deleted it and redownloaded it a couple times but the game still wasn’t letting me play. I looked to see if it needed to be updated but it showed it’s last update was 1 year ago. Game owners: MAKE ANOTHER UPDATE"
"7579",938095479,"Who can help me to beat the level 90 enemy. I have spent at least 5 stones on it, but still failed????"
"7580",938095479,"Wish it had an English translation so could read instead. Have to translate on my own. It can be difficult to do this on my own."
"7581",938095479,"I know this is probably tiring to see people ask for English translation over and over again, but it can take away from the enjoyment of the game. I personally watched the anime and hit the Wikia pages for this game to actually get what's going on.  However if you do ever decide to add a transition to the game, it would cause more good than harm.  Although adding another language means more work, English is one of the top most spoken languages in the world and many people who aren't from English speaking countries speak it so you would get more people to play your game and therefore make more money. If not for the fans of the game to enjoy it better, think about profit please!   Not to mention it's hard to do in game microtransactions when I have no idea what I'm clicking on."
"7582",938099257,"Not worth .99 at all. Pease stay clear of this App."
"7583",938099257,"THIS APP IS WAY TO STRANGE"
"7584",938099257,"This app is priceless I should not have bought it"
"7585",938207958,"Great concentration game I love it"
"7586",938207958,"Fast moving, good graphics, wish there was a back to previous screen option!"
"7587",938207958,"Relaxing game to play"
"7588",938571723,"I bought the Little Twin Stars Colorful theme but its not there and when I went to go buy it again the app says that I already have it when I don't... what's going on?"
"7589",938571723,"I love this app its super cute and helpful . The themes are adorable."
"7590",938571723,"I love this app soooooo much❤️❤️❤️  It is amazing💙💙💙  If you do not have it then why don’t you download it ???  Best app💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛  😉 amazing"

"7593",938596958,"It’s about time u bring out an English version or language option because we don’t speak Chinese and this app seems like a nice one but we can’t understand a thing... 😡😡😡"
"7594",939529493,"Could u stop ur event and make the game more stable? IT CRASH TOO MUSH!!!!!!"
"7595",939529493,"Not a bad tower defense game. Lots of levels and tower builds to enjoy. Tons of towers and enough spells to enjoy, plus heroes too."
"7596",939529493,"I agree 100 with kalawac it’s and awesome game is like to see some sort of offline campaign kinda stuff added in or altered I’m not always in location where I have internet capabilities be awesome to have some offline access"
"7597",940006911,"Great mix of design, puzzles, environment and layering of tasks. Art direction, animation and audio are fantastic.   Having played nearly every point and click game out there, this is definitely on the short list, but I wish it was just a bit harder. I felt like most of the puzzle solutions were immediately apparent; only a few took some extra thought. That said, having played the first four chapters over a year ago, jumping into episode five felt abrupt and it took me a bit to get my bearings and remember what I had previously accomplished. It would have been nice to have a recap to kick off the episode.  But still enjoyed all of it. Looking forward to more!"
"7598",940006911,"Game started off great. Wait for almost two years for the ending was extreme. Ending is now here, and all I can say is what a disappointment. The last chapter was short, easy, and the ending came out of nowhere, and didn’t even really finish off the story. I should change my title, as this wasn’t rushed,it was just poorly done.   Don’t waste your time playing this. A lot of us wasted a lot of our time and money on this, and the developers really let us down."
"7599",940006911,"This game was a lot of fun to play. I don’t play a lot of phone games and this one made me want to play the game more often than not. I wish there were more games like this on the AppStore."
"7600",940202798,"You should add eldora speedway and the ability to work on your car at your trailer also you should make it to where you can drive your truck and trailer to the different tracks"
"7601",940202798,"You need to add cations heats warmups features  more flags and restarts and pits and you should have to drive a trailer and have your own team and you should have to pull out of the pits and you should add different types of dirt cars and you should be able to watch other races you should also get money for were you finish and be able to buy parts sponsors and crew members"
"7602",940202798,"Haven’t been able to play the game for well over a month now. Won’t get past the “powered by” screen. Would be nice if there was setup adjustments as well"
"7603",940247939,"I can’t change my zip code information to e-file and I can’t file without it accepting my information and the information I’ve put in is not incorrect."
"7604",940247939,"My credit union I used for direct deposit on TurboTax e-file was closed before I received my refund I tried to explain this but they insist on twisting the information with my turbo card through green dot bank, long story short David passed me to Angela and she hung up on me, what kind of business do you expect with people that incompetent? I told Angela that the credit union said the deposit was rejected so it went back to green dot she said they do not transfer funds to my bank that the irs does so I said how do you deduct fees for your TurboTax service before I receive my refund “click” if you would recommend this service to your friends and family press one. I have used this service since 2015 and now you can bet I am ending everything at this point. By the way I e-filed in February and didn’t get anywhere with my refund until August so I will be first to say TurboTax is not quite the same anymore..."
"7605",940247939,"Downloaded app to get access to my filed returns. Each time I login it says I need to go online and can’t use the app, logs me out. Worthless."
"7606",940268124,"This app is amazing, but why have to pay SO MUCH??  Thanks Medly! I do now see what you mean. 🙂"
"7607",940268124,"Amazing chances to create and learn about music😂"
"7608",940268124,"Medly is the perfect daw for learning music production, this is because of the simplicity of all of the instruments And the creativity the app requires. I loved it  until one day when I logged on and wanted to spend money for a new pack. It was the future bass pack and it looked amazing then I was met with an unpleasant surprise, medly membership. I might delete the app but even worse for you guys you just lost money that I would have spent. RESIST THE GREED if it is attached to the membership DO NOT BUY IT.  Now medly I have no issues with a membership service if you allow separate purchases as well but it is wrong to lock it all down under that membership.   Thank you for listening to my ted talk."
"7609",940292587,"don’t do it don’t get sucked in because they will  lose all your levels and take your money now I’m waiting for them to give me back my rubies I paid for , lost 500!!!! and my luck I probably get screwed , have to go back to zero and start spending my money that I already bought.  All the money  I sent in addition to the 500 rubies I opted , paid to open 3 new places. It’s all gone . do not spend money on this game they will take it and give it back to u but make you start at zero !"
"7610",940292587,"Why are soooo many scenes in night mode?????  And, they stay that way forever!!!"
"7611",940292587,"Fun game"
"7612",940452319,"I love this game! But there are a few things I would suggest. Maybe you could make more ways to earn gems! Or you could maybe lower the price in quick play to not die. I love this game so much though! Developers, please respond!"
"7613",940452319,"The game is so fun I loved how you can get some nice characters and I loved how they  Looked The only problem was the game was glitzing but I still love the game  😊☺️😒😩😭😁😳😱🥵🤔😑😅😂🤣😆😌"
"7614",940452319,"How did you make this game it is the best"
"7615",940508574,"I love this app. I’ve had it for years, it’s went through 4 or 5 different iPhones and it has always restored my purchase of the full version. Awesome app. Does everything it says and more"
"7616",940508574,"It’s ok I guess"
"7617",940508574,"This App really allows a person to be creative and accentuate certain aspects of picture for impact purposes."
"7618",940596201,"Get tap titan 2 ya the first version isn’t support anymore it dead and you can’t do much on it don’t get it."
"7619",940596201,"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"
"7620",940596201,"Love this game. Boom!"
"7621",941057494,"This game is is full of beautiful features and small touches that make it what it is, a masterpiece. It tells a sweet story of a star-cross relationship. At the beginning, you see where Nova is blown apart by a attack and you play as Kosmo and have to find each part of her in different crazy, cute, and creative worlds and put her back together! You even have bonus items to find that brings back memories that u can watch. The music is beautiful and every world is different. You have to use ur mind in every level because no level is made the same. This game will rip your heart out and put to back together from it’s beautiful art and touching story lines. This game is a must get if you love puzzles or just want to pass time and enjoy every minute of it!"
"7622",941057494,"Yeah sure this game is really great. but tiny their was my childhood. i would actually pay again to be able to play it. PLEASE! That game was a classic. i would do anything to be able to play that game again! :("
"7623",941057494,"This game is the best the levels were very challenging but I got threw it I really love this game so much and also can you make another one Love You To Bits 2 that would be amazing thank you for listening!"
"7624",941087958,"A pretty cool game so far."
"7625",941087958,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:7a3e164c4a3d2bc4 (or search the account name as ""ASO 100""). Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"7626",941087958,"This game is great, I had it on my old and loved it. As soon as I got my new one I downloaded it, I tried the second game, but I found myself coming back to this."
"7627",941107732,"My child new right away it was fake she started crying thx a lot"
"7628",941107732,"This game did not work when I tried it for my brother"
"7629",941107732,"i tried to do this but every time i filled out the info a ad would pop up and restart me from the beginning (DO NOT GET)"
"7630",941143328,"I like this game, I play it a lot and I am on night 6, but there is this one glitch with the mask. When there is a withered animatronic in my room I try to use the mask but it does not pull down. So I end up losing, but other then that this is a great game!"
"7631",941143328,"Look,I’m a big fan of Fnaf and the game, But I find it kinda of dumb that I can’t see foxy when flashing the light in his face, but he is really there behind one of the other characters because while I wait for the effect of the animatronic scanning me, he gets ready to kill me, plz make that he can kill me a few secs after the robots scan.  Thank you"
"7632",941143328,"This game is awesome. Would highly recommend even if you don’t like horror games."
"7633",941380906,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I HAVE PLAYED IT FOREVER! There’s just something about it that makes it SO fun. But I DO have 2 issues, neither of which matter THAT much, but still.  1. The fusion mechanic is cheap af. The ONE fusion is Alexandrite. That’s it. Wait wait wait, now I’m not saying that’s lame. It’s amazing! OMG ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TIME I USED IT! But it’s Only Alexandrite, and she’s reduced to nothing but a Super attack. 2.Garnet is TOO OP. Diamond Mode World 5 Gauntlet is the ONLY thing that can challenge my Garnet with an ATK of 39! U read correctly, THIRTY NINE!  P.S. If you want to skip the intro, just double tap the home button(or do whatever u do to open the app selector screen to instantly go into apps still open)& then go back in, the game glitches for a second and the intro ends immediately(it works for me atleast, if it doesn’t work for u, or if ur on a computer....sorry)Combine this with a setting so your phone doesn’t power off when u leave it alone and u can play hours of Attack The Light without turning it off ONCE.  P.P.S. If I had to ask for 1 thing, PLZ HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT BATTLE MUSIC, and Special music for the Gauntlets, the Secret levels, the bosses, and 1 special one ONLY for the FINAL BOSS! ADD THIS PLZ!"
"7634",941380906,"i’m like 3-4 years late but i recently finished playing this game with all 100% and it was such a great game. The mechanics and power ups was really great!"
"7635",941380906,"I love this game but the problem is there is not enough fusions one of my favorite reason I bought this game is to do all the fusions so please add more fusions😭!"
"7636",941920716,"Needs skins, new animals, and obstacles. Hopefully y’all read this and add these too which would be Great 🤗"
"7637",941920716,"This game is awesome 😎 thank you for creating this app keep making more games let God be with you! 🥳🤩😚😋🥰😇"
"7638",941920716,"The force waiting was correct you should add more animals like A elephant 🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘"
"7639",941931465,"I like playing to relax and this has a nice story and pretty pictures."
"7640",941931465,"The game is hidden objects and that it gives you. I really like that very much!!!! Not complicated at all 😀"
"7641",941931465,"Well thought out, good graphics, but freezing screens, or no frames  are frustrating.  I would pay except for glitches.  Videos for extended time don’t load, or they start to load at the next screen. Purchases disappear.  Too bad, it could be really good.  Want to make money on this?  Please fix the glitches"
"7642",941956069,"Whoever made this KEEP IMPROVING IT PLEASE it has a beautiful format but it needs updates it buffers a lot and has a bunch of technical issues.  If someone would truly spend the time and improve this it would be worth it!"
"7643",941956069,"This app is more money grubbing than motivational. Constant ads about “buy this if you want to be reminded about ___.”"
"7644",941956069,"It used to be a good app with nice inspirational quotes. But now it's mainly questions or promoting something. It's like getting a notification for an ad. It's really annoying and I don't think I'll be keeping the app anymore."
"7645",942003779,"I have played this game a few times through.  Currently trying to get highest scores on all levels.   This game has been out for a couple years and it’s still really good.  VERY SAD the developers haven’t added to the game in all this time.   The map looks like it has some possibility to add more levels.     If you want a challenge try to go through every level without killing enemies.   There are a few that you can do it on.   It’s a challenge but sad that there is not a difficulty bonus for no killing."
"7646",942003779,"I absolutely love this game! The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that I want more!! The game is a bit short for the money paid for it."
"7647",942003779,"The controls on mobile are terrible. Give me the option to play this turn based when I choose to; forcing me to play a game that rewards precise control that has a garbage control scheme is stupid design."
"7648",942413257,"Since one week, update 3.9.5, the app is useless. The screen is constantly flickering and it’s impossible to read anything. Before that it used to be my favorite weather app."
"7649",942413257,"Hello, any plans for an Update?"
"7650",942413257,"I’ve used this app for 6 1/2 years.  In the last 18 months it’s gone from my favorite most used weather app to my most frustrating weather app.  Basically, Now it’s just LessCast,  or CrashCast, UselessCast, NoCast, ZilchCast, ZeroCast, CrapCast, & of course...  now it’s, DeletedAppCast.   Thanks for the total letdown!"
"7651",942494098,"This is a great game and there are no problems and I watch DudePerfet all the time and it is great"
"7652",942494098,"It’s a good game but the energy goes by 1 fast"
"7653",942494098,"This is so"
"7654",942766453,"There is ample evidence after only a few plays that the die rolls are wildly skewed and the AI sees your hand.  Probably okay for human players."
"7655",942766453,"Horribly biased rolls."
"7656",942766453,"Couldn’t even get through the tutorial. Not at all pleased wasting my money on this. Avoid."
"7657",943101317,"A great time killer. Clever with great graphics and timely hints. Looking for more like this."
"7658",943101317,"It's obvious what needs to be done, but I can't seem to find the perfect spot to pour the water into the beaker.  The developers ought to be ashamed of themselves."
"7659",943101317,"Little early to rate , but graphics are superior and story line is good.  So far, great game and worth the $"
"7660",943116454,"So far it seems great. Easy to maneuver from place to place, straight forward as to what you are getting and how to use it. Puzzles are challenging but you don't spend hours pulling your hair out either."
"7661",943116454,"Very tiny graphics on iphone 5"
"7662",943116454,"Friends & Followers,  Very basic game with twist at end of it.  Well detailed & vibrant background scenery with interesting characters. Casino style option for playing different styles/types of solitaire in ""Extras"" section is nice bonus.                           BUT Save money for another game: Too short in playing time, no map, strategy guide poorly written, hidden object & mini games not challenging at all (even for beginner) along with poor explanation as on how to play for some of them, too much back & forth between scenes, ""Mentor"" for magicians gives off ""creepy & sinister"" vibe due to artist's rendering & artistic presentation, voice synchronization deplorable and finally, ""collectibles"" are not well hidden, thus taking the fun out of the challenge that one is supposed to have in encountering them.  Thank you for continued support & following. ~Kamen Rider"
"7663",943587620,"Paribus is the second me. Always scanning and confirming delivery dates and prepares for any adjustments. I’ve already used this several times to chat with Amazon or Target to get a price adjustment. Thank you!!!"
"7664",943587620,"In the time I’ve had this app I never received a refund!!! This app is a scam."
"7665",943587620,"Paribus has contacted me a few times and has saved me so much money!!!"
"7666",943594558,"Please fix it anyone this game was the most fun but now i cant even play it right since it looks streatched out please anyone"
"7667",943594558,"Really great game well worth the 99 cents  a $1.  But needs diffrent modes  like one mode timed and one another mode no timed would love to see levels and more from this game"
"7668",943594558,"I love this game!! It is sooo much fun but it has not been updated in a long time!! Please please update this game!! Some new worlds or players!"
"7669",943837049,"Very difficult to find a lot of the objects!!"
"7670",943837049,"Instructions too vague.  The hardest Hidden objects game I have ever played."
"7671",943837049,"Not fun at all!  Rarely play anymore.  Don't like the graphics, either!  Penalized for tapping on the correct object!  Disappointed!"
"7672",943869618,"this game needs to be free"
"7673",943869618,"I love this you can do so much keep up the good work but can you add more please thanks!! ❤️❤️❤️"
"7674",943869618,"When I first got this game I was happy for like a month but after I got bored and abandoned the game. We need more food updates. It’s the same old food.🤦‍♀️"
"7675",944011620,"First “smart” device I’ve purchased and extremely impressed with how easy it is to interact with and get used to helping out. Absolutely love how it can connect to so many other devices as well. To put it simply, so cool!!"
"7676",944011620,"Alexa, stop playing music. Stop on the app on my phone don’t matter. Like she likes it and don’t want it to end. Even tried power off. Had to push the power button. I tried all variations of saying the words."
"7677",944011620,"On top of constantly switching signals and cutting out when I ask for sounds it only plays a short time, this is a recent problem. It doesn’t know the answers to quite a few simple questions. I ask for forecast and sometimes it answers “I don’t know that” in regards to my city but other times it knows. Infuriating! My friend has a google home and never has a problem! Hate this thing and I have three of them. Thinking of switching to google"
"7678",944165809,"I enjoy this game to the point that I no longer go to school. I only play Kaiser. Nothing else. (Just kidding but I wish I could.)"

"7681",944393180,"Hi, I just want to ask you if you could change the subscription thingy back to a purchase! Making elements was not premium a few updates ago. And you guys made a LOT more elements premium than it needs to be. If you guys change that, I’ll be sure to purchase premium soon! See ya! 🥧"
"7682",944393180,"I love this game but when I try to edit Fujins swimming animations the game crashes or the whole editing area turns black and than crashes and it makes frustrating to create a fujin creation. Thank you for taking the time to read this review"
"7683",944393180,"Hey there I started playing"
"7684",944644383,"Awesome love it cuts out real good"
"7685",944644383,"does the job right"
"7686",944644383,"Please update this one time purchase app to the same version as your subscription base model, this is the same exact app - but you have not updated it.  Will change to 5 stars if you can update the app.  Tried to get a refund."
"7687",944808246,"This game does not require WiFi, so you can play anywhere that you wish too. It might cost a bit of money but, in my opinion, it is really worth the price."
"7688",944808246,"I love them 😍"
"7689",944808246,"I love this game! You. Get cubs early, so many possible colors and quests, and it’s easy to survive! I live for hours! But I have a suggestion; ULTIMATEWOLVERINESIM!!! PLEASE, PLEASE 🦡🦡🦡🦡🙏🏻🙏🏻💕💕💕 (plus a shrimp and warrior cat)  And please make a werewolf where you can hunt people!  Thank you for your time  PLEASE ULTIMATEWOLVERINESIM!!!"
"7690",944808252,"This game is quite disappointing actually. I was having fun doing it, but then I decided to look at the other dog simulators and they were free and had lots more choices for things like tame or stray. I absolutely love your horse simulator."
"7691",944808252,"They keep killing me I really don’t like it"
"7692",944808252,"It’s a great game and all I just wish there was more stuff to do👌"
"7693",944985743,"But to get gold on everything you need to spend money to buy the last motorcycle"
"7694",944985743,"I like it except for not being able to fully see crashes because of the crash graphic that appears during every crash"
"7695",944985743,"Game is a good time waster, BUT, the bikes shouldn’t be as much as they are to purchase, we shouldn’t have to play a level 50 times to get enough money to buy the next bike. And as stated above, when the slow motion starts at the final Jim, how about slowing our time down along with the motion.good game but it has a long way to go to keep me occupied."
"7696",945077360,"Never any problem with programs or special events, well worth the money"
"7697",945077360,"Sling tv is the **it, I can watch all of my shows and record them...i also added stars as my premium channel, can’t miss Power😁 Sling Tv is soooooo reasonable compared to Verizon, Direct tv, and Xfinity. Sling was the best choice that I made and most definitely will stick with them....."
"7698",945077360,"i can watch tv anywhere and i love it !"
"7699",945177811,"If your looking for true honest games here’s one and if you love animals then it’s great for you I’m a beginner and I can already tell I’m going to love."

"7701",945177811,"Will you make a gorilla sim pleases"
"7702",945274928,"I have played this games for years now. It started out as a great game. But recently it is driving players away due to the lack of enforcements for griefing on lower level castles or players selling accounts that are claimed to be modded. Alliances are forcing players to either quit the game, join their alliance, or be attacked often enough that they are NOT able to do anything but retrain and heal troops. If developers would seriously listen to and work with players that actually play the game and NOT SPEND MONEY on it..this game would be great again."
"7703",945274928,"if you reset the cell phone and put it back on tea it starts until you already do castle 5 so you can use your old account it's stupid that"
"7704",945274928,"In June I made 2 in-app purchases at the same time. I only received 1. On my fifth ticket with customer service, I didn’t check on it for 24 hours. They closed the ticket because I didn’t check on it frequently enough. So I gave up. They stole 19.99 from me that day.   Today was the end of a month long event, the Lord Trials. For $9.99 you had a chance to open double the rewards. So I opted to join the advanced event. At the end I had 27 reward chests that I needed to buy a key to open. It gave a message saying that the items were sold out to play the event. It was an ongoing event.I spent the last 25 hours of the event trying to contact customer service to buy keys. The only response I got was to uninstall and reinstall the game. Which I did, after that I didn’t hear back from them.   If you choose to download and play the game screenshot every transaction."
"7705",945402023,"There's no sound we need an update for this app please! Anybody know who to contact about this??"
"7706",945402023,"There is no sound. The app is broken. Visually looks engaging though."
"7707",945402023,"Just bought this game for my children & there's no sound! Not very fun when they can't hear anything. Hope this issue gets fixed."
"7708",945434433,"This app is utterly useless. The developers managed to find every way to circumvent convenience and common sense, creating a completely unusable app. Thanks for nothing, jerks."
"7709",945434433,"They force you to buy a ticket through oui, after cancelling all train from Paris due to a fire, there was no customer service to help make other arrangements at 9:00 at night. I had to book flights costing 600 euros at the last minute. Poor customer service"
"7710",945434433,"Having everything in one place (ticket, discount cards, traffic info) makes this app extremely useful"
"7711",945621521,"Great games"
"7712",945621521,"Don’t get a lot of coins to play with and what you do get goes really quick. The bonus you may get may be big, but if you play a little higher amount it takes it all back. I did better at the casino!"
"7713",945621521,"I adore playing this game, China River, but over the weekend I received a huge bonus that was magnanimous. I was overjoyed but that was short lived because while I waited to see what my total bonus amount was I noticed that I received nothing. And it was a huge bonus. It has made me so sad because I have a great time playing this and as frequent players will attest to, we love our bonuses.  Who do we contact if we have an issue? Plz respond.  W Cmon people. I love this site but getting the best rewards is few and far between. Help out those of us who love this site. Plz keep us coming back."
"7714",945623719,"I remember downloading this game maybe two-three years ago, I didn’t remember but when I finished 5 levels apparently you have to pay mo ye to “win the game” it’s really not worth it. To be completely honest I’d rather play girls go games than play this.  Hope this feed back is understandable."
"7715",945623719,"Why do you have to pay money for the other levels. I really hate this."
"7716",945623719,"I want my money back because 5 yrs ago I bought the stupid bridge and it didn’t give it to me today when I re downloaded the game"
"7717",945832041,"Worked great for a bit and then the login changed and I can't access my work's VPN. We require a teuring code along with a password. It had a spot for the code before, but that has disappeares so I can't enter it anymore. This means I can no longer use this app."
"7718",945832041,"I would give this zero, continuously disconnects every few minutes, it is unbearable"

"7723",946099227,"I have been counting calories for nearly a year with this app and have lost 40 pounds to date. It tracks my food (not too hip on the new format yet) gives me credit for activity and lets me easily log repetitive foods. I’m still getting used to the new format. Jury is out."
"7724",946099227,"Update makes even basic features “Pro”. Time to delete this bloatware."
"7725",946099227,"The new update sets calorie goals for each meal. The goal for each meal increases ratably as the user exercises during the day if the user wears an Apple Watch. Thus, if I meet my breakfast calorie goal of 450 calories and the get credit for 600 calories of physical activity, my breakfast calorie goal retroactively increases. What is the point of that? The previous version was more useful."
"7726",946168827,"Love, love, love this program. Initially downloaded this for my grandson, but found that I love it as well. So much so, I find myself myself on it more than him! Thank you for this fine program! Oma"
"7727",946168827,"15 dollars to see animals! I wouldn’t sorry."
"7728",946168827,"Unbelievable app about wildlife, real family fun."
"7729",946382493,"I can’t get this app to work. It locks up on startup. Tried deleting and reloading and still won’t work. I paid $4.99 in in app purchase. How do I get my money back?"
"7730",946382493,"So I walks trying to start the game and it asked me to press the action button on my vr set, I couldn’t even start the game because I didn’t have an action button on my vr set."
"7731",946382493,"this app is incredible! it is scary and fun. i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good vr game! the paid version is much better than the free one, i will say. i play it every time i put my headset on. great game!"
"7732",946434924,"If I could have just one game, it's this one."
"7733",946434924,"This is the best mobile flight sim I ever played.  It beats other games by a long shot.  But please add helicopters it would complete this game"
"7734",946434924,"Would love to see F-16, east coast maps!!!"
"7735",946477821,"It’s nothing new."
"7736",946477821,"The only reason this isn’t a 5 star review is the puzzles. They’re not really fun, just sort of there."
"7737",946477821,"I like the game. Concept and all, but why can’t I switch between playing on iPhone and iPad? I started on my phone and now I would like to continue on my iPad but I can’t? I don’t want to start over.... it took too long to get where I’m at. Bummer."
"7738",946496840,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"7739",946496840,"This is a fun game and the time to unlock items is ok but when you finally do have enough to unlock a new ball it gives you ones you already have. Been trying for months to unlock one ball as to unlock a new level but can’t ever seem to get there. Good time killer though."
"7740",946496840,"I totally love this game! I am a basketball player ⛹🏼‍♀️ and the graphics are really good! And you get to play as a boy or girl! It’s so real! But...I would love it even better if you got to customize your hoop. It is already an awesome game and I have been playing it since last year! Thank you for reading this!"
"7741",946811576,"I used to play this game and really liked it but then got tired of it so I un-downloaded, and in that time it wouldn’t still let me play the game when the “opponents” were getting ready and such but now when I downloaded back it wouldn’t even let me in. It would stop at the “mysterious girl” then the music stops but the screen is still on but then it just shuts off. Went back in more then 5 or more times already. It’s really a disappointment since it’s a good game."
"7742",946811576,"So I’m using iphone6 to play the game and when I found a match and loading the game crash every single time I"
"7743",946811576,"Not sure what happened, I hadn’t played the game for a month or two and when I came back there was an update. I was like “ok” and downloaded it without a second thought, but now I can’t log in to my old account. Like, it’s still there, when making a new acc I tried to use the same name and it said an acc with that username already existed, but i just can’t log into it. Is anyone else having this problem?"
"7744",946903436,"This game is very good.But the fact that there’s only seven levels is crazy 😮!Because in this  is gamer show called Parker plays and there’s way more missions And levels like 0g     levels or bagel 🥯 race you can even play a baguette🥖 but the only reason why you could do that stuff is because it was tv 📺 edition. so can you please add the stuff from the tv edition to your pocket edition please so one last time can you fix this problem"
"7745",946903436,"I thought I would love this game but it’s annoying can you give us check points to make It’s a lot easier also it’s very hard with the controls especially with an iPad I don’t know how people get to the end it’s practically impossible please update soon and make this easier to win and play. 🥺🤗"
"7746",946903436,"I paid for it it wouldn’t load so I deleted it and it won’t download   I’m so sad because that money was from my dad for my 12th birthday and he is in California I’m really sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
"7747",946930094,"Really very useful app, like it."
"7748",946930094,"I use this for my consulting business. Documenting my work. Capturing data both paper and from digital screens."
"7749",946930094,"It’s great!"
"7750",947281623,"Hello I am a kid and this ruined my life now I know Santa is not real also I called him in summer and he answered One last thing THE STUPID THING IS JUST A BOT"
"7751",947281623,"Why did you switch from the realistic looking Santa to this janky looking mall Santa knock off? Very disappointing to my 3 year old grandson."
"7752",947281623,"So I tell him what I want for Christmas and he paused and I did it again and he said I’m stalking you so I was so scared so I tried to delete it and it did not and then the name of the game was stalking Santa so I figured out how to delete it you Just have to delete all the apps you have and I asked him please don’t stalk me and he said I hate you"
"7753",947402822,"This satisfies my desire to play this game when I'm on the go!"
"7754",947402822,"A faithful and well made version of the board game.  Polished, great sound effects and sound track and a fantastic campaign mode to keep you building the most ridiculous space ships.  Plenty of humor, had me chuckling many times. The designers and programmers did a great job bringing this awesome game to iOS.  I’m having a blast with it."
"7755",947402822,"lol at the review on top tgat said you should be able to “buy a prebuilt ship.” I think you miss the point of the game. You’re supposed to build ridiculous ships. the board game is a scramble for tiles irl.  That being said, why did the   app makers think it would be fun to pad a really  fast game with slow flavor text cut scenes and really slow redundant animations? yes there’s a FF button that sorta works...but it would be nice to have the option to play the actual game. also a drag that we cannot quit and restart where we left off without having to dreg through all the padding."
"7756",947529440,"My siblings and I got the Osmo genius kit for Christmas last year and so far all the apps work great. Masterpiece is actually really challenging though, and too hard for my youngest siblings (3 and 5 years old) to draw. They now prefer the latest addition to our collection, Osmo monster, where what they draw doesn’t have to be perfect.  As for he other apps, Osmo Newton, Osmo numbers and Osmo letters all work great, though it is a bit difficult for my siblings to find a letter in a huge pile of tiles. And Osmo tangram works well too, it just seems very dull and is easy to complete all the levels even for 3 and 5 year olds working together.  As for the Osmo apps as a whole, my siblings all enjoy playing games from our collection and have added the Osmo Coding and Osmo pizzeria sets to their Christmas and birthday lists! Thanks Osmo, for creating a great set of games!"
"7757",947529440,"This game is grate but it is just not loading.I tried everything so I don’t know what is happening."
"7758",947529440,"You make my drawings that I draw look beautiful because each time I draw something on Osmo it helps me to draw better thank you so much I love Osmo 😻"
"7759",947548754,"Not very difficult (a big plus for me), and it made me smile and even laugh out loud. Nice job"
"7760",947548754,"I liked the pixel style but didn’t care for the game that much. The puzzles need to be sharper and more realistic in nature. I understand it’s not meant to be too serious and we’re talking zombies here but a skateboard to fix a flat tire? Really? Who would think of that? It’s also just too much zombie for me so it feels repetitive. More people gave it a better score so it’s obvious that this game just isn’t for me."
"7761",947548754,"Do it !"
"7762",947624478,"Awesome game but don’t waste $2 on the paid version just get the LITE. They are the exact same. The only difference is that you pay for one and the other one you don’t."
"7763",947624478,"To short and can’t return for refund I will not purchase from fire rabbit again till I’m able to refund my app"
"7764",947624478,"This game is so awesome I don’t even no what to say"
"7765",947644950,"The app is great. When it works. It freezes every time I try to use it. Please fix that issue and I’ll rate it higher. (Shopping at Whole Foods for pickup is all I’m trying to do. )"
"7766",947644950,"On ios 13, the application does not work in the background.  Just switch to another application, after 30 seconds, flex automatically closes completely.  Unable to receive instant offers.  Fix please!!!!"
"7767",947644950,"It’s frozen I can’t do anything"
"7768",947805279,"Mine stopped working after 3 months. I sent it back with the dated receipt and guarantee form. I emailed the company when I had not heard from them after a month. They ignored my email."
"7769",947805279,"They started out okay, but now it’s just becoming a useless app, no updates, crashes, not worth the time"
"7770",947805279,"It is impossible to register."
"7771",947824428,"Great photo app I just wish they had a video feature and more options for the camera"
"7772",947824428,"Fantastic app Please increase the number of mb in the high Rez and also kill the clicking sound !"
"7773",947824428,"I have had this app for just a couple days now. I have been using it mainly for landscape pictures including sunsets. The HDR software is by far the best I have used on an iPhone. The result has been stunning photos I could not have otherwise captured. I rate this app ‘five stars plus’ from day one!"
"7774",948201260,"I like the game, a little tiresome when other players are in it to win. Bets high with no real cards, but betting high making everyone else fold. Not playing cards!"
"7775",948201260,"I agree this seems not so real.  I have to play more conservative because of the miracle cards that get me.  Some players go beyond locker room talk and make threats.   recently, adds pop up when you leave a table or moving around in the menus.  With all that being said i enjoy the game and hate the adds that pop up."
"7776",948201260,"Rigged!"
"7777",948478740,"Best Mac app ever."
"7778",948478740,"This app only works for locking the device but fails to unlock using Face ID"
"7779",948478740,"Doesn’t work anymore"
"7780",948561621,"I’m sorry, is this being updated or something?!? It won’t load!!! What is it meant for exactly! This is by far the WORST wait ever!! I’m wasting my time doing this. Please tell me? Also sorry I’m a little grumpy."
"7781",948561621,"This game is the best game I have ever played"
"7782",948561621,"No stars!"
"7783",948634806,"What are you waiting for!? This is a GREAT GAME! Please add some records, stats, a highscore table. No reason to play this game if there are no stats"
"7784",948634806,"I used to play a plastic toy like this when I was a kid. I liked combining baseball and pinball. This game works fine and has good graphics and sound.  It needs stats, leaderboard, and maybe another mode.  It is completely free, so thanks for the good work."
"7785",948634806,"Cpu dominates Trying to pitch is a waste of time Cpu gets hits at will killing the interest in a one sided affair Install only if you like a fixed losing game"
"7786",948715059,"Very nice"
"7787",948715059,"This game kept me entertained for ages. I haven’t got bored once and as you progress the game only gets more entertaining. Definitely recommend."
"7788",948715059,"It was fun when I downloaded it before, year later I reinstalled it, and still just as great!"
"7789",948757156,"Yikes. The new speed/class/pace tabs are terrible compared to the old speed tab. I always thought that's what set you guys apart from the other racing apps but now it's just like them.  It actually keeps getting worse. What happened to the horse info?  Past races, jockey, trainer, sire, etc?  I still can't get over how much I hate this update. I've never seen something so great go to complete crap so fast. Its taken the joy away of betting and watching races when not at the track. Please put it back the way it was. Why try to fix something that wasn't broken!??"
"7790",948757156,"Absolutely terrible app now. Video is atrocious freezes constantly. jockey and trainer stats combo stats are now non existent except for a few meaningless ones they removed anything useful. Definitely would not recommend new app"
"7791",948757156,"Why change, the app is a loss for me now. Even watching races is glitchy. Very clunky feeling and difficult to see workouts, past race videos, speed rating are a mess. Please reverse update!"
"7792",948805709,"The game is good. But it needs... BOSS FIGHTS! A boss fight appears before you get into Plankton’s time machine, but be careful, bosses have health. If you fail a boss fight you have a choice to continue, or go GAME OVER."
"7793",948805709,"It’s not very responsive. I bought it for my toddler and thought maybe he was just having a hard time buts it’s hard for me to play as well. My son LOVES anything spongebob so he plays everyday and everyday he gets mad as heck because it doesn’t respond when he swipes. An update would be really nice. It’s kind of overpriced for y’all to just say screw updating it. I can’t be the only person with issues."
"7794",948805709,"Please add more playable characters at least 1 or 2 Patrick’s."
"7795",948857526,"Love the programming and strategic positioning aspect in battles, the scenery, voices, and music."
"7796",948857526,"I loved the gameplay, it’s quite unique in my opinion, the visuals and music made this game. A hidden gem. Many story decisions are rather questionable though. But ignoring the story this game is one of my favorites."
"7797",948857526,"The screen ratio looks off on the iPad Pro 3rd gen."
"7798",948861271,"When I land, I can't move, like, I literally can't walk."
"7799",948861271,"here is why it's terrible. 1: I can't stop flying 2: I can't swoop on anything because it won't let me the game freezes 3: I can't pick up anything  that is on the ground 4:i can't find a mate, I've played this game for hours every day until today and I've searched everywhere but I still can't find another owl (same with ultimate dog sim)  ps I love every single game you make plz make more games 💙🐾💙"
"7800",948861271,"Hello I found out why I can’t download this app it’s because you need to update this game and others. Update for iOS 11. Please I really want to play this game and others. Yes more also need this update. So please can you update this game and others to iOS 11. Please. Thank you"
"7801",948958859,"I love the game I’ve only been playing it for one day then, today is not letting me get in SpongeBob game frenzy please fix that it was my favorite game I use it on my iPad I don’t know what’s happening with it but please help. I don’t know if it’s my iPad or if it’s the game but please fix the bug if it is a bug! It used to be my favorite game in the App Store but now I can’t even play it so idk now... every time I go in it with my iPad it crashes like it doesn’t even make it to the beginning part.."

"7810",949281035,"This game is stupid don't git it"
"7811",949281035,"What would the first question be? Then I realized it was 9+10. The first time I thought I was actually looking for the answer and that I am really smart do not try to say ""YOU STUPID"". About after 6 or 7 addition questions, it took me to subtraction ones. Once I got to the multiplication questions and got a question wrong, they crossed out You Stupid and replaced it with You SMART. At least that was good. One reason why I am rating this 3 stars is because ads"
"7812",949281035,"I can't open the app, though I don't know why I was looking at these things."
"7813",949344041,"Not surprised the game is like it is, I have similar complaints for all of Line games and apps. Very little care or thought is given to all of us outside of Asia. We don’t get access to most of the good apps and games, we don’t get the free stickers that Asia gets - there are so many free packs Linked to company promotions for instance but we aren’t allowed to download them for some reason because we aren’t allowed to friend any of these official accounts so we don’t get their free Stickers. That’s just an example, but there are so many cool games I want to try but can’t because they aren’t available in our region. You’ve taken away games that I’ve played for years and years, discontinued utility apps that were cool, and same complaint with this game but in reference to the in app features. The app is greedy, for one."
"7814",949344041,"I can’t stop playing this game!! It’s so much in this game.I’m on 116 levels but still have so many things to enjoy with this game every day.I spent some money to buy the diamond  in the beginning to build my farm but now I collected it a lot from each event without spend money to buy diamond at all.Enjoy your farm and all super cute stores!!!"
"7815",949344041,"You think a game that’s three years old now would stop crashing. Fix the bug issue and it’s a 5 star game"
"7816",949498190,"This is an incredibly satisfying well-made game. I played it for years starting with the earlier versions. It's wonderful it's brilliant and kudos kudos kudos, truly, top of the heap.  Now the downside which is ninja mode… I'm all for the limitations to challenge me, but it is ridiculous for the number of moves to be completely unpredictable! They do not correlate to pieces or anything else. There is no way to know if my six pieces are going to suddenly become three! Please please please make this just straightforward no mystery moves lost. Or if you insist on losing moves, Please make it clear and understandable how moves are lost!  ALSO: could you please insert a ""no, thanks"" button on all the offers for move, saves, swords, etc? It's really tiresome day have to sit and wait for the count down…"
"7817",949498190,"Love the game! Used to play all the time and re-downloaded this version. Only complaint is it’s kind of glitchy, I’ll go to make a move and it’ll be delayed, making me hit the stars. Another thing is so many ads. Other than that, great game"
"7818",949498190,"I absolutely LOVE the iSlash games, especially iSlash Heroes, and have played them for years... But PLEASE fix the problem in the “ninja” section of this game where you only get a certain number of slashes to complete each level- about 80% of the time, it counts each slash I make as two slashes instead of just one, which makes it EXTREMELY difficult to pass a level!!!  I’m not doing anything to make it do this and have tried different methods of slashing but it still deducts an extra slash from me."
"7819",949701151,"This game is the best I have ever played. I am so glad you guys made this game but I hope you can make story mode on the game then that would be really cool. PLEASE.PLEASE."
"7820",949701151,"I love this game bois"
"7821",949701151,"Niaaa"
"7822",949785353,"I played this game for several years and the gameplay is dead! The developers will not listen to the players. The game leans hard towards the Chinese. If you would like to spend a lot of money on a game with no gameplay this ones for you. Invest in something else pass this game by...."
"7823",949785353,"This game is all about spending. Game glitches on a regular bases. When you provide proof of game mistake they still blame user for there mistakes. If you do get help it’s based on how much money you give them not what is right. If you read this I advise you to pick another game rather than deal with this. Everyone is leaving as they ruin the game. You have been warned!!!!!"
"7824",949785353,"Plain and simple save your money thief server issues you get attacked because you can’t get on their server and they “test their systems” after the updates then say no problem on their end must be your device or connection  Same story always"
"7825",949838009,"I’ve had this app for a couple of years & I tell everyone about it when they laugh as I talk about my countdown to retirement app - then they love it & ask what it’s called so they can get it too!...I’ve added other countdowns but retirement is my favorite!!!"
"7826",949838009,"I consider myself pretty loyal when it comes to apps. I rated it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ there’s been one occasion where syncing deleted history. Other then that great!"
"7827",949838009,"App crashes on opening installed in iPad Pro 11 (2018). Have not been able to get it running in that particular iPad model. I have been an avid user for year's of this application in iPhone and older iPads. Even payed the upgrade. Would a fix for the crash at start up be fixed please?"
"7828",949870726,"I have been playing this game for about 6 years and honestly I enjoyed it. The cars looks absolutely great from the interior to the exterior. Being able to build your own shop and seeing the team you hired to work on your cars was a nice touch. The game also lets you customize the car with spoilers, front and rear bumpers, side skirts, rims(about 1-4 choices available), paint and the hood. But what I hate is that AI can be either slow and let u take the lead or they can smoke you!! There are times where my car rating was much higher than them but they still manage to smoke me. **Heads up, if you get the GTR in a FlashEvent be ready to get smoked cause once it takes off there is now freaking way you will catch up to it (even worse in the derby cause their is no chance of catching up)** also a tip: If you wanna win but you are neck and neck with the AI, push it into the guard rail he will lose speed cause of the dumb mechanic where if you scrape the car on the rail it loses all its speed."
"7829",949870726,"The cars really are impossible to fully control. You skid like crazy, the steering is faulty, and it is also pretty pay to play. But still I like it. But it needs the Porsche 918 Spyder, 911 GT2 RS, and 911 GT3 RS, Tesla Model 3 Performance, Aston Martin DBS Superleggera, Audi R8 And TT RS, BMW M8 and M5 Competition, Bugatti Chiron, Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, Jaguar XE SV Project 8, Lamborghini Urus, Aventador SVJ, Sesto Elemento, and Hurracán Preformante, Lexus LC500, McLaren Senna and 600LT, Toyota Supra (2020), and Rolls-Royce Wraith."

"7833",949876643,"AWESOME"
"7834",950022424,"I love this app. So many great products for great prices. The only thing I don’t like is sometimes an item I want isn’t available, but it it rare. Thank you."

THEN YOU MATE IS SAFELY IN YOUR CARE. It’s pretty easy. And why are there traps but not trappers? The kind of trappers who skin you for pleasure. 🤢🤢🤢🤮. And PLEASE make the graphics better!

Story Time! 🐆 Blackberry nuzzled his mate. Secret-keeper shivered. Even though the air was nice and warm. They sat and shivered in silence. 10 years later.)) Blackberry bent over the creek and sipped up tiny droplets of water. His son, Dark-moon, had been sent out, and to return when he was full grown. To show that he would be worthy of a place in the pride. Only if he survived... He began lapping the water. “Even though the water is warm, but it’s sending me shivers..” thought Blackberry silently. Secret-keeper padded out of the shadows. Her paws making no such sound. She smelled like Dark-moon. She looked full of despair and hurt. She motioned for him to come, “Follow..” she seemed to say. She led him towards a clearing. In the center, to his horror, was Dark-moon’s lifeless body. Long lashes covered his face. His chest was ripped open by vicious claws. Blackberry wailed. Secret-keeper cried out with him. Their only son, their Last son, was dead."
"7838",950130103,"Gluten games has the best simulators. They capture the movement, environment, and graphics perfectly. The “ultimate” sims seem to beat their best so far. I love the easy sandbox play. I can’t believe they pack so much game into such little files."
"7839",950130103,"I like the game a lot. But I’m asking you to fix Bad Elf simulator if that’s okay. I would definitely buy it! It looks so fun, and entertaining. This game is nice"
"7840",950299949,"The only reason I downloaded this app is because I can race my music but i would really love the app if you add YouTube support or you can make it easier for file transfer like you can work with files so you can transfer their or you can do something I JUST WANT TO RACE MY MUSIC please make it happen"
"7841",950299949,"I cant believe i spent $1 on this game because it said i can use my own music WHEN I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO AND THERES NO TUTORIAL ON IT EITHER!!"

"7851",950574221,"While the game is fun, it’s completely limited by in game shop which is not to mention in top 5 most expensive shops that I experienced online for a mobile game . Dear creator update the price and lower them don’t be a stupid selfish moron and idiot"

"7854",950593464,"Ok, so I’m really confused. I’m 11 and the only reason I’m 11 and here, writing a review is because I had this when I was littler and just now randomly thought about this game then came to check out the reviews. AS EVERYONE KNOWS THIS GAME IS MADE FOR KIDS AGES 4+ So all these hate reviews that are complex and use BIG WORDS, I’m confused as I said before. I don’t think that 4 and 5 year olds write this type of review. In fact, I don’t even think kids that young would be writing reviews. And sorry to everyone who thinks this is too much, it’s just my opinion. I know! These are just your opinions too about things to make the game better, but honestly do you really think that young kids that are 4+ will care about these type of things like having actual orders you need to take, characters too customize etc. And don’t get me wrong that’s great and all but just remember how much work that is for something that young kids probably don’t even care about.  Sorry this was so long, just thought everyone could think about this before writing your reviews. (If you made it this far then wow) Thanks:)"

"7858",950669893,"The only problem I have is the app won’t stay open while I’m walking. I’m constantly having to reopen to check my times."
"7859",950669893,"I was charged $1.00 without my permission by purchasing the app when it gives you the impression that it is a free app. I do not want this app to charge my card any fees as I am uninstalling immediately."

"7868",950823223,"The story is campy but it's kind fun. Where it lost me was when it introduced reaction-time situations. I prefer pure puzzling and adventure, not dodgem. So I decided not to finish this. Let me know if Elena saves her dad, k?"

When I knew I had solved it, but couldn’t do what was necessary, I checked a variety of video walkthroughs which verified the issue was Apple TV. I’ve written weeks ago to the company, and they’ve ignored my support request.   Generally, before that glitch halted all progress, it was way too easy and a bore. Don’t waste your money."

"7877",951346423,"some of these levels are just impossible they probably just randomize the different obstacles which makes the levels impossible at some times. along with ads, this game can make you very frustrated... i would give it five stars if they had made it a little easier. i understand if they want to make it challenging, but at this point, it’s not challenging, like i said, it’s impossible."

"7880",951350964,"It does not work because like there are only some filters and like they are ugly and then if you want cool filter you will need to pay 0.99. And that is mess up that we had to pay and then some people got it free"
"7881",951350964,"This app just explains how to make lazy money. There is only a few filters, which you could get way more of with a million other apps. For all of the sticker the sticker that are free are stickers of Andrew Bachelor (King Bach) and the rest cost $0.99 each."
"7882",951364656,"Barely any ads, it’s very fun and addicting"
"7883",951364656,"This game is really fun and addicting,  but every time I start the game, an add pops up in the middle of the game. Since you have to click on the screen to move the ball, I always accidentally click on the add. Then, it won’t let me exit the add."

Please update it or let me know if there is a way to fix it on my end. This app actually did help get me out of bed, when it worked."
"7904",951876055,"This app WAS wonderful, but it is unfortunately no longer being updated to fix bugs. It doesn’t go off at the time set, only a notification pops up (about an hour after set time), and doesn’t prompt you to do any body, mind, or motivation exercises. I sent an email to support, but it bounced back. If this app gets support again, I will definitely re-download. Until then, I’ve taken it off my phone."
"7905",951876055,"It doesn’t work. I used to LOVE this app. I downloaded it again about 6 months ago and realized it was broken. It rings like a normal alarm, and then that’s it. It doesn’t do anything that it says makes it special anymore. I tried again this week but it’s still broken. It rings like a normal alarm and you simply swipe the notification and it turns off... no body, brain, or motivation wake up as advertised. It’s such a shame because it used to be an amazing app but I guess the developer accidentally broke it wit updates and then just stopped paying attention to the app. So disappointed because I loved it. Oh well"
"7906",951937596,"Help me out to eat my come back"
"7907",951937596,"It’s Outlook. Unfortunately every couple of days I start it up and it greets me with the Setup a New Account screen. Mail app has never forgotten my Exchamge account settings spontaneously, but thi has been going on for years with Outlook."
"7908",951937596,"Terrible my outlook is screwed"
"7909",951971414,"PLEASE fix the laser so that it doesnt immediatly crash your game."
"7910",951971414,"When you pick up the laser it crashes plz fix"
"7911",951971414,"Great experience on the go as long as the laser is turned off."
"7912",952549036,"There’s no question that the app has some flaws but come on, those sounds are rich and classic! And they still have the best GM patches that you’ll find anywhere.  I did have a big latency problem on an iPad Pro and a Bluetooth keyboard - enough so that it was difficult to play but if you have a midi file ready to go then you will be amazed at what this app can produce.  This would get two stars for everything else but because of the classic Roland sounds it’s getting five."
"7913",952549036,"One of the best sound bank but need improvements...  No auto learn... Too many lil bugs... No 5d or mpe... Interface is yukkkkk... Background and inapp problems time to time... No velocity control... Effects eq etc are limited and not easy to change and parameter on the way...  Still use it but not live on stage or I run it on another device getting ready to get back to my main iPad and do with gadget, sampletank, garage band, noise, etc... none of them have so much good sounds inside even if each one have some gorgeous..."
"7914",952549036,"i used to love my SC-55 back in the day, so thank you Roland for bringing this to iOS. as for the numerous complaints about not being able to save settings... READ THE MANUAL. press menu then select help, then go to page 21... it's all right there. i also was able to play the sound canvas live as a sound module, as well as toggle on/off the playing in the background issues stated in other reviews. i can appreciate the frustration expressed in the other reviews, but it's just a matter of knowing how to use it. best of luck to all SC users."
"7915",952555810,"Crash after wanting to save picture to gallery"
"7916",952555810,"Plz download. I don’t care if the game hasn’t been updated in a year. This is without a doubt, THE BEST GAME EVER"
"7917",952555810,"I have had this game for a long time and the game continues to add more content. Love this game!"
"7918",952561811,"It moves well, sounds good. But I'd recommend adding a way to turn off the timer"
"7919",952561811,NA
"7920",952561811,NA
"7921",952578897,"I think overall the app is pretty cool. But I think you should have the cool filters out and for the really cool ones you should be able to earn them instead of paying for them because some people are poor and can’t pay all that money."
"7922",952578897,"That pretty much some sip my review"
"7923",952578897,"This is a pretty cool app."
"7924",952632588,"Works very good. Used the app and printed out 2 years of text messages between me and my ex wife for custody. Worth the money."
"7925",952632588,"I had a few tech issues to sort on my pc but  Export Messages support was OUTSTANDING and immediately responded to my email then resolved issues very easily and painless via text.  I am very pleased with app, it does work 100% as described and is a LIFE SAVER for a particular project I’m working on.  THANK YOU EM TEAM!! Rhonda"
"7926",952632588,"This app try’s to get you to submit your ID and password. I didn’t fall for it. I really regret paying $10 for this. Which I could refund"
"7927",952658839,"This game is the funniest game ever I love playing it. I play this game nonstop.i wake up and play this game all day"
"7928",952658839,"Might as well call it AdTube.  So many annoying ads. Deleted."
"7929",952658839,"Love you game :) ❤️🥰😘😇💙💕🤩🥰🥰"
"7930",952658953,"If you drag the windows off screen there will be no way to retrieve them back on. You’d have to reinstall. Also the game kind of feels like there’s no end."
"7931",952658953,"It’s a piece of art to organize the materials, leads to many possibilities, many are illustrated but one truth. However how can you tell in the end?"
"7932",952658953,"I loved the idea and couldn’t put it down. Sadly, I was done in one sitting. I think there should be something more."
"7933",952694580,"It’d be nice to be able to add courses to member plans. It would work like a schedule."
"7934",952694580,"越来越不喜欢几点 1.训练营不见 2.收费定制课程感觉很差 3.客服差 4.地区有版权限制练太极fit，连用了vpn都没办法练，qq音乐都能听了，是有那么敏感？？？？"
"7935",952694580,"因为李现下载的这个软件，又因向往运动坚持这个软件"
"7936",952715194,"You can’t really do much because everything is way to expensive you’ll run out of materials soon and the only way to really progress is to pay but it won’t be worth it because you’ll have to buy another of the same thing you just bought after two days"
"7937",952715194,"I was playing on the event level And I couldnt even spawn in Because there’s a canon that tracks a  monster  that flys So yeah rigged And I even spent so those Gem things just to get there (10) And I was very far in with good loot   Give me all the stuff I lost back please and I’ll change it But I still like the game (aka a 1000 gem and that’s all I remember lol)"
"7938",952715194,"It’s a good base game but there are way too many ads, microtransactions, near-impossible to get without paying kind of items, and the necessity to have to complete your dungeon twice in a row to save it is annoying"
"7939",952929696,"I really enjoyed this game"
"7940",952929696,"Great puzzle game"
"7941",952929696,"This game has had me working so hard to complete every level and get every coin. It truly is a game you must get to see how great it is."
"7942",953086535,"The UI is a little bit clunky and old-fashioned but I love the fact I can run it on Linux, Windows, Android.. oh and my iPad. I would rather something work very well then look very good with a few glitches. I have use this product for over a year it has been bulletproof."
"7943",953086535,"As of this review this doesn't support ANY type of S3 storage, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. It only supports limited consumer cloud sync like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive.  The desktop version is a night and day difference from this mobile app. Hopefully you don't make the same $9 mistake...."
"7944",953086535,"The apps does what it does well. Read the instructions to get iCloud Drive working. It takes a bit more work than the other services."
"7945",953230894,"Great app! Easy and fun.. Just don't like it requiring wifi.. A tad glitchy, but overall wonderful! 🙂"
"7946",953230894,"great combination of puzzle, addition and subtraction game"
"7947",953230894,"Just downloaded this game but the sound doesn't appear to be working. Maybe it was lost in the update? I'm sure it can be fixed."
"7948",953426154,"Excellent app for keeping on track. Only short coming is there is no widget on the Apple Watch app. Having it on my watch face would be excellent; similar to some other apps in this category. Being capable with the Siri watch face would be astronomically impressive. But; as far as an iPad/iPhone/MacBook app. I love it."
"7949",953426154,"This app is why I’ve been able to survive grad school — it keeps me focused and accountable, and displays graphs without any setup on my part so I can monitor how much I’ve been slacking.  The custom categories are great. I started adding time for menial jobs like dishes / laundry / etc. and now my apartment is as clean as my study habits.  Thanks guys! Totally worth 2 bucks!"
"7950",953426154,"Use it every day and love the time value it teaches."
"7951",953511734,"I have used this app for years. It’s fantastic! I will not use anything else!"
"7952",953511734,"Loved it"
"7953",953511734,"I love this and it is awesome"
"7954",953831664,"It can be kind of depressing, a dog laughing at you. This is one of those apps you play when you just want something to do. Or you just have to live with a crying dog being smarter that you."
"7955",953831664,"It is a fun way to practice your quick math and the dog is funny"
"7956",953831664,"The dog is very mean!! He is a bully"
"7957",953876014,"Crashes every two minutes.!😡😡😡😡😡  also whoever reads this is to cool for this game.  😎  Sorry got to go vets. Story next time"
"7958",953876014,"This game is awesome. But unless I’m lucky, I get taken to the home screen in less than a minute. (If I’m lucky, it’ll be 1 minute)  Please make an update. And take your time on it.   Thanks for making these great game! But I’d like a UltimateSabertooth. And please make a UltimateWolverineSim! (Since I love wolverines and Wolverine is my favorite superhero!) 🦡🦡🦡❤️😍🙏🏻  Add on: okay, so, this game shuts off usually when I reach the man skull. Please fix this!"
"7959",953876014,"I know lots of people are allergic to gluten so I think it’s great that you your game studio shows that anyone can make any type of game even if you’re allergic to gluten so thank you for making my game experience the best"
"7960",953923489,"It is so fun play it I’m only seven and I downloaded it today and I almost know everything so cool everyone should try it🤩it’s like I can 😢 everyone should try it"
"7961",953923489,"It’s awesome"
"7962",953923489,"It’s not as good as nba 2k or nba live mobile but it’s decent"
"7963",953936584,"Great game but needs more levels"
"7964",953936584,"Such a great game amazing graphics fun game play but I wish they would create more levels to play"
"7965",953936584,"I guess the developers are still celebrating Christmas which makes them busy enough for not adding any levels. But for how long???!"
"7966",953940121,"Please have this translated to English! -throws money at and sons-"

"7971",953946902,"It's a good old fun puzzle game Though it's a tiny bit to hard :get it? It's meant for the hardcore puzzle people  Though it's still very fun i say it's worth the 2.99$"
"7972",953969225,"Controls could be better  Don't get"
"7973",953969225,"I enjoy the game, but lately it's been crashing for me in the middle of the game. I can usually tell it will crash because it starts to la a bit. Im on an iPhone 7."
"7974",953969225,"Seriously, the worst game ever. Don't play it. There is no creativity put into the game."
"7975",954205285,"面白いゲーム🤣"
"7976",954205285,"歴史のクイズ等ためになるので、なかなか面白いです"
"7977",954205285,"無課金でもかなり楽しめます。"
"7978",954323480,"Enjoy having a game like this in the notification screen. The more I play it the more I like it. Good job!"
"7979",954323480,"Installed on iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 plus. Doesn't do anything at all. Widget is completely blank. Contacted the company two weeks ago, no response. Total waste of $1. Do not purchase."
"7980",954323480,"The last IPhone update and it won't open to play."
"7981",954549897,"Well, this is the 3rd game I pay for and it has crashed and it seems we are paying for games we can't even finish.  I was really enjoying the game and was near ending it when it just froze.  I was on the roof with the sun dial and the puzzle where Jack and Gall are in.  I was working the puzzle and all of a sudden it froze.  How about fixing the game?  It seems I am not the only one that experienced the game crashing.  Very disappointing!  An update on the 2/5/16 update...it did not fix the problem.  I still cannot continue with the game.  It is frozen.  Here it is the end of August 2016 and I checked back to see if any fixes were made to the game and NOPE!  It has frozen and cannot finish the game.  Paid for it and nothing to help its customers.  How about an overhaul so those that have had this problem can finish the game."
"7982",954549897,"This game played great on my iPad mini 2 with no crashes. I even updated to iOS 9.3 halfway through the game and it still played great. I love creepy, spooky games and this game was spooky. And the hint system is awesome. I loved it!"
"7983",954549897,"Game freezes. Rebooting doesn't help. No excuses."

"7989",954779921,"great"
"7990",955157084,"It is a really fun addictive game that you can enjoy"
"7991",955157084,"It is a great game it is so addicting when you die you want to play again but the reason I gave it only four stars is because if you keep messing up it will get frustrated but overall it’s a great game"
"7992",955157084,"So fun! Good for ages 8-12"
"7993",955170175,"I actually enjoy the game to be honest, but recently I downloaded it from the App Store and it runs once then crashes every time I attempt to play it afterwards."
"7994",955170175,"I hate this game because I was playing it and I beat my score and I was at 2343 score then they put an ad in the middle of the game then I lost"
"7995",955170175,"I think the game is a really fun and addicting game my highest is 331. The only reason. That i didn’t give it 5 stars is because of the adds and i also thought of suggestion. My suggestion is that when you die or get a new color there should be some cool effects"
"7996",955260074,"Easily one of my favorite games. I downloaded it ages ago and only deleted it to save space on my phone. Now that I’m back with it, I’m glad I came back for more. Still just as addicting and fun and right up my aesthetic alley. The only way I can see this improving is if we had the option of turning off sound effects so I can solve the conundrum of wanting to play but also wanting to listen to just that rad soundtrack."
"7997",955260074,"Good"
"7998",955260074,"It's a great game never had any issues with it just had not had a update in a while"

"8001",955266964,"21 and godie and Odell and on fleek"
"8002",955286870,"If I click the three bars on the top left hand corner. It gets stuck open and I can't return to my search until I close the app. Very frustrating. The app is convenient but this glitch is super frustrating."
"8003",955286870,"There is an issue with the map view while looking for housing in Los Angeles, and California in general. It just places the map on an open stretch of ocean, and does not lay any pins/dots where the houses/apartments are located."
"8004",955286870,"Aquí pongo en renta mis casas y nunca se tarda mas de 7 días en rentarse."
"8005",955290679,"Have you ever thought of, releasing this app on android"
"8006",955290679,"I keep reading reviews about the touchy trigger...are you all aware in the minimal settings, there’s an option to turn that off?  I think I got this app back when the App Store used to do a free app every week (they should bring that back, lol). It’s my go to when my brain needs to decompress."
"8007",955290679,"This is one of my favorite games on both the iPad and iPhone - a great way to pass a little idle time in an airport, or wherever you just want to shut your brain off for 5 minutes.  It doesn’t really need anything major - gameplay is still perfect and why mess with success, but it could use a few usability/device updates. It doesn’t fill the screen on the latest iPads. And as others have noticed, the rotation is a little weird - switching from portrait to landscape isn’t always a success. Particularly if you have a picture-in-picture video playing at the same time.  Also, I would LOVE to be able to move the pieces side to side using the iPad Smart Keyboard arrow keys. That would be amazing."
"8008",955298998,"This game is so simple yet very frustrating and addicting.😁🤗"
"8009",955298998,"Not much to it. But entertaining none the less."
"8010",955298998,"I Enjoy This App, & Find it A Stimulating Addition To My Normally Stricter, ""Brain Training"" Style APPS! Fun."
"8011",955327604,"First off, there are almost NO ads, unless you count the little ones at the bottom. I loved trying to find the jelly drop things so I could make new characters. And also, the music is AMAZING!!  This is a really great game ;) nice job guys"
"8012",955327604,"This game is very fun and challenging, yet simple. I wish there was a little bit more to the layout and challenge aspect, but it is quite fun to see how far you can get the jelly to jump!! 😂"
"8013",955327604,"Jelly jump is one of my favorite games. It’s not to hard but not to easy, no glitches or bugs. I also love how it can be a two player game! The only thing I would recommend it more jelly Peices to use. Other then that, 😘"
"8014",955682952,"It won’t even let me click the gold mine when I first even downloaded the game. Complete waste of space."
"8015",955682952,"Can’t even click the mine to get out of the tutorial"
"8016",955682952,"Hi  there is a bug I’d like to report when you receive your first daily reward which is 5 auto mines you go to the mine to use them but when you click the auto button you get kicked out of the app this is a very annoying bug so I would appreciate it if the developers would fix it ASAP thank you for your time."
"8017",955705796,"I want to get back into this but I need controller support not just gameplay support but menu support too it’s 2019 why doesn’t this game have controller support"
"8018",955705796,"Great game"
"8019",955705796,"Amazing game just wish that you could get all the characters easier"
"8020",955832188,"2 starts because the app worked for two days and then stopped work all together.. This was a total waste of money.."
"8021",955832188,"When you get the app open settings and select your language or you'll have problems. Mine was in a language not common for the area."
"8022",955832188,"I sadly fell for this crap. Don't waste your money. It's completely bogus and doesn't work."
"8023",956794130,"This game was amazing. I wasn’t sure if I would like it at first but I couldn’t put it down. Really makes me thing which I loved"
"8024",956794130,"please its so fun"
"8025",956794130,"This game is interesting and calming at the same time. What the game lacks in frills it gains in beauty and simplicity. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and look forward to seeing what the developer has to offer"
"8026",956811074,"This is perfect for pulling diagrams and tables out of high yield review texts for classnotes without maintaining the in-book design.  I scanned a table and was able to make original looking notes in a concept map format from all the info within a minute.  Realize that this is definitely meant to do that, not much more.  The template can only be applied post editing, so you cant write on the paper background you want it in.  Only one pen option which you can change the style of in the post editing template area, but not in active editing.  The pen absolutely needs to have a smaller line width option - 3 available and to really use this practically, the narrowest setting is where I'd have a highlighter set to.  The app is great for not getting distracted and for what it is.  A few minor tweaks would make it excellent, in my opinion."
"8027",956811074,"Carbo makes pretty good scans, but it’s crippled by the lack of a viable export option. Users need to be able to select multiple scans and export them to PDF or other file formats. Until that happens, save your money and consider this unusable for most purposes."
"8028",956811074,"Was hoping for same sketching engine as on Inko, but it isn’t. And with no demo version, no way for me to test without costing $8.   At this point, I won’t use this app and wish I could get a refund."
"8029",957124541,"Love the board game...Love the app"
"8030",957124541,"I love this game because it gives the option of multiplayer. Countless nights I have played this with friends. The game is beautiful, with smooth graphics and extreme detail. Sound and music is incredible. The overall game is extremely fun, and very easy to look at."
"8031",957124541,"Very entertaining and stimulating gameplay, thank you"
"8032",957212695,"This game is amazing!!! It’s just number 1 I wish that there where other endings like you being able to wait out the storm and not get killed or if like you do something that makes the dolls upset causing them to try to kill you number 2 I think that there should be more of a story behind the game like why are there paintings of them on the wall or why do they want to kill you (as I said before) hope you take some of my ideas into consideration!!! Bye!"
"8033",957212695,"No matter how I put it in my headset it did not line up and I saw double in the game. Plus it is short and not at all scary."
"8034",957212695,"I love it it’s so funny when the sister turns her head!"
"8035",957302048,"I really feel great about this game because of all the graphics and sound effects.  They really feel awesome, they also sound like it’s real.  Games also great for player on player battles as well as player on cpu battles.  One suggestion is to add a few more vehicles so you can still get more cooler vehicles and already having good stuff.  Of overall its a great game and I hope Atypical continues with a this."
"8036",957302048,"Game does need t even work waste of money"
"8037",957302048,"I’ve waited like three years so I can actually get the game and now it doesn’t open and now I want a refund"
"8038",957316969,"I love the gameplay but find the in-app purchase screen deceiving.  There is no way to get out of it.  All I wanted was to get rid of ads and after purchase, no way to get out of online purchases and back to the game."
"8039",957316969,"This is one of the most addictive game in the world"
"8040",957316969,"It ok"
"8041",957471210,"Should have read the reviews before spending money on the coloring pages. The app doesn’t work as promised. Want my $3 back."
"8042",957471210,"needs to have less things to buy so the kids cold learn for free"
"8043",957471210,"I love the app and it is the best game ever I cannot believe everyone else is super duper rude"
"8044",958174054,"This game is really cool, I love the T. rex escape and the fantasy roller coaster, but the simulator is not good for a few reasons one it’s plain two you can’t do anything in it and three I don’t have a three but I also don’t like the jungle but still awesome! 5 stars ;)"
"8045",958174054,"Personally I think this game has great potential but could have better graphics. This game hasn’t been updated in about a year and I wanted to give it 3 stars but took pity on the creators and gave it 4 stars. I have a crack on my screen so when I’m driving away from the T. rex the windshield looks cracked which is pretty cool. 👍🏻"
"8046",958174054,"It was really quick to download but it’s really boring it just replays the same  clip over and over      WARNING⚠️⚠️ bordom a head"
"8047",958455860,"The amount of content in this game and overall polish makes me feel like I am robbing square Enix for only 20$ price tag. Although I am still salty that I can’t play chaos rings 1 and 2 after paying for them I am satisfied with three since it is significantly better"
"8048",958455860,"I didn’t review it when I first got it a couple years ago because I thought there would be better ones, but there weren’t. This is the best game I’ve ever played on mobile. The only game that comes close is KOTOR and that’s not even really a mobile game. It’s a port of a console game. Chaos rings has been around for a long time and it’s still better than any game that’s ever featured on iTunes."
"8049",958455860,"They just don’t make games like chaos rings anymore it’s actually sad to me. I love this series I still play the original three on my older devices and wish I could play them on current devices, I mean I did pay for them, and they are still on my phone, so it’s kinda crazy that they just don’t work I expect more from square enix, though I’ve been disappointed since they ended guardian cross, song summoner, and so many other great games.  Anyway I short review of chaos rings 3 this is the best game on mobile currently, the controls are perfect it was made for mobile so it’s not a crappy port of a better game. The music is beautiful and hits you in all the right places at the right times. Story is a little complicated at times but after you’ve caught up and understand it’s a great story with every character brining a lot to the table, there are no weak characters here, though I may be missing something some storylines seem to be open ended 5 years or so ago I thought they were just leaving it open for the next game, but I don’t think it’s coming. Graphics are really amazing for the time and mobile I would say it’s early ps3 level though some corners are a little blocky and animations could be better. Finally gameplay I love turn based rpgs though I prefer atb style this is alright faster characters get to attack first but it is straight turn based, and I’m not that into the card based level system with the rarities and combining it seems like you were trying to make it seem “freemium” style with out actually being able to pay for it.   Thank you square for the amazing games please bring back the older games we all love and paid for, and please start making real games again."
"8050",958604518,"This game is so engrossing and stunning. The writing and gameplay is top notch. The soundtrack and mechanical knowledge is unique and makes this game so much more impressive. I’m very impressed. One of the best games I’ve played, and I’ve played a fair few!"
"8051",958604518,"I love this game. I played it over and over. Then I went searching for other games that were “almost” as good but have yet to find one. Developers, I hope you make another game soon like this!! Thank you!"
"8052",958604518,"It’s a gorgeous game with a interesting story and that’s where the draw ends.  Cons: puzzles that without grandpas diary would be completely unsolvable because there’s no logical way to deconstruct them.  If you’re not playing on a 55” flat screen you’ll be pixel hunting for places to move and items to pick up.  And when playing on Apple TV the remote is terrible for any puzzles that require timed movement to complete puzzles."
"8053",958763157,"I Got my Man to Play this Game and We Love It👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"8054",958763157,"This game is so addicting! You’ll want to never put down your phone ever! It’s a great saving game. And you can socialize with friends!⭐️ It is a great game for people who like the fight war kind of things! So download the game and fight dragons!!!!!🐲🐲🐲⭐️"
"8055",958763157,"The game is very fun and entertaining. Besides collecting dragons and participating in weekly event, the main attraction in my opinion is the community. The people are great and you make a lot of new friends. However, the people at pg need to step up their game and take the community seriously when issues are discussed. Overall a fun and a good place to make friends."
"8056",958848462,"Fun game, please fix tizoc’s the SP feature for Justice hurricane and Big Fall Griffon"
"8057",958848462,"I have an iPhone 7 Plus, the highest power iPhone model available at the time of writing. There is no reason why this app can't run on my phone. It runs at what feels like half speed at all times. The King of Fighters i-2012 runs better on this phone and not only is it extremely old and built for old devices, I'm pretty sure it has more going on under the hood. I've played this game on the Nintendo Switch and at EVO so I know that it's normally a good game. It is astounding how such a fun fighting game is given this sort of treatment. This game would make Street Fighter IV Championship Edition look like a complete and utter joke if only it was playable."
"8058",958848462,"Oh yes the greatest fighting game ever made, just for my new iphone!"
"8059",958904868,"I’ve an American fan of the moomins since I was about 12 years old and this game just warms my heart. I love farm games and stuff, so this is right up my alley. Also, this is very easy to pick up and play so I strongly recommend it for any moomin fans, new or old, big or small."
"8060",958904868,"This Game Is SUPER CUTE!!! Moomin,& All His Friends, Plus You Get To Decorate, Grow, Win & Play. It’s A Win WIN Situation!!! It’s One Of My New Favs!! I Also Have Happy Garden,& Alice! There All Super Cute And Just As Fun!!"
"8061",958904868,"With interactive characters and an art style that mimics the comics very well, this game is better than any other farm game, especially if your a Moomins fan."
"8062",958957112,"So don’t mess with this your other franchise you can use kodi it it is illegal but it’s streamed to one line so you won’t get in trouble"
"8063",958957112,"I think that this can get you arrested don’t fall for it"
"8064",958957112,"I think this is an amazing movie app it has VERY many movie and tv shows I love I just wish they did have more tv shows such as riverdale and things like that otherwise this app amazing and you need to try it (BTW I’m not a robot I know what a crosswalk is😂)"
"8065",959304067,"The best app ever  😍"
"8066",959304067,"Love the game and it’s very easy and addictive"
"8067",959304067,"i get a fish I CANNOT EAT IT!! Plus I can’t find one of the nest sights.But ADD DEER SIM NOW I WILL GO NUTS IF YALL DONT horns male no horns female.and when the baby is level 3of it still has no horns female.but if horns start to grow it’s a boy!"
"8068",959327054,"When I originally tried to download it I thought it would download on its own and I went off to play a game, but when I came back it had no process in the downloading! This was very frustrating as I had to go on the App Store and stay on it until it downloaded, I also had some trouble with the app opening but eventually after a few tries it opened and I was able to enjoy it."
"8069",959327054,"Yes"
"8070",959327054,"I just recently got a VR Headset to just chill and go through the VR experience and it’s amazing! I first got Google Cardboard which this app is compatible with and it’s amazing! Just before writing this review I did the Lego Batman experience and the Mission Impossible mission and it’s pretty amazing! I’d highly recommend this app and if I convinced you, hope you enjoy! 😄"
"8071",959390742,"I looove snail bob! It is such a delightful puzzle game!  You can tell soooo much work went into each unique level. Figuring out what lever to pull or what to tap to get to the end is great fun.  Finding the stars and puzzle pieces makes for an added level of interaction and might be my favorite part.  (though i also like failing the levels sometimes too just to see what will happen hahaha). Snail bob was such a great game, and snail bob 2 is a great addition."
"8072",959390742,"I love the game—please bring out the new levels! Need more Bob!"
"8073",959390742,"A great follow up to #1... Tons of innocent fun and with little challenges throughout. Love the touches of humor.  Looove this app! So fun"
"8074",959452391,"Very good game"
"8075",959452391,"So this game might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely unique, and in a sea of clones, I appreciate that.  The mechanics may seem screwy to some.  But if you try a practice round or two, learn from them, and try again, you'll realize that not everything is unintentional.  There are some clever tricks at play here.  Bottom line: It's just a game, after all, and life is too short to be led around by naysayers.  Give it a whirl!"
"8076",959452391,"This is really fun and takes some thinking. I just wish I didn't die so much!"
"8077",959469304,"Great port, runs at full speed! Only problem is the wonky controls, but the Special Assist button makes it easier!"
"8078",959469304,"Great port of the awesome classic Fatal Fury special!    I did notice though that all the in game text (not menus) and title screen is in the Japanese language localization version, even when I switch the “language” option to “English.”  Doesn’t affect gameplay as the game in game options and in game difficulty settings are in English, but it would be nice to have the USA localization, especially the fantastic winning battle quotes.  Also, if the game is open and I switch to another game and then back the game force closes and I have to reopen it.  Other than the non-game breaking issues I mentioned up above, this is a flawless 5-Star port, Fatal Fury Special rules!"
"8079",959469304,"This games is excellent and i really REALLY wish that you guys add more games. I’d be happy to play them all. Fatal 1 and 3. Or even better add Real Bout Fatal Fury"
"8080",959619034,"Really cool easy controls"
"8081",959619034,"The first part is pretty easy it will get hard but it is easy"
"8082",959619034,"Love Flight Pilot! Totally addicted!"
"8083",959937622,"I don’t like it that much"
"8084",959937622,"I SAW I VID OF THIS AT YT KIDS AND THIS GAME IS WEIRD 1.why she need some clothes her chest though 😑 AND NOT DOWN LOAD OK GEZZ THIS GAME DONEST WORK I WANT TO SEE FOR MY SELF?!? THE VID IS SO DUMB AND INAPPROPRIATENESS"
"8085",959937622,"Game is so awesome! I love it because it is so cute! Although it would be better if they had a different number of kittens each time. Overall it’s a pretty good game."
"8086",959954514,"There are many fun and entertaining games out there, but this app was truly a joy to play. (Even multiple times) :) An extremely creative way to utilize your phones abilities in ways you didn’t know possible as well as bring a smile to your face!  I’d give it more stars if I could!  Looking forward to more levels in the future :)"
"8087",959954514,"Great game!! Fun and really keeps you thinking"
"8088",959954514,"I got the app for free for a Starbucks promo, so I didn’t have to pay, that was 2 years ago. They said more levels would come. I’m still waiting"
"8089",960128616,"I used this app for a really, I mean really long time and you added that you can plug to Xbox. How do manage to do that?"
"8090",960128616,"I love this app it helps with my Minecraft worlds but all of a sudden it stops working. It says be 1.12.0 or up and I’m 1.12.0 but it still says cant connect vpn please respond"
"8091",960128616,"For some reason I cannot host a server on my iPhone XR and it makes me sad. Because I could do it on my iPod touch which is older. I can still join servers but I also want to host them. But other then that the app is alright."
"8092",960161732,"I am Incredibly impressed with this game. The levels are short but the game never gets monotonous (I’m on something like level 250 after a week). It has ads, but they are quick and not at all too repetitive."
"8093",960161732,"This is both the most relaxing and rage-inducing game that I have ever played on a phone."
"8094",960161732,"I really like this game and it is so nice I have played through it once and know I’m playing again."
"8095",960251959,"New update keeps crushing."
"8096",960251959,"Enjoyable and 2 much fun"
"8097",960251959,"It’s a Nice interesting game, I don’t have issue with the downloading but when I’m playing the game it just hang of a suddenly...pls what can I do to stop that occurring"
"8098",960506557,"Is there any reason why we cannot connect"
"8099",960506557,"I love this game so much! I have a few ideas though I was wondering if you could add a melee mode with swords,knifes and stuff like that. Also maybe a multiplayer were someone else plays with you but you don’t fight them you defeat enemies side by side😎 also maybe pance customization"
"8100",960506557,"They need to add AR15s, Scars, and M416s"
"8101",960708632,"I love this game, but this new update I can’t play my games without it being interrupted by a blue screen or ads, so sometimes I have to close it out and reopen it and still have a blue screen then it reloads. I never leave a review but this time I think I should let you know of the glitches on the game."
"8102",960708632,"Game is good but need a way to earn jewels so you can buy needed items. Should not have to pay to advance in the game. Takes forever for your health to regenerate so you can play."
"8103",960708632,"I loved riddle Stones and have played up to level 3000 plus with my old I-phone 6 Plus. Now I have new iPhone XS Max. I downloaded Riddle Stones to continue playing but I found that I have to started  all over at Level 1. Is there a way to get my old levels."
"8104",960716999,"I told you already! Out like a light"
"8105",960716999,"If it’s a sleep time app, I don’t want to open the app and have the background all white. If you make it dark, then when you are ready to open the app, you are not blinded. And what happens in the middle of the night when you want to keep the noise going...? Whiteness."
"8106",960716999,"Awesome sounds for free and the optional add-ons are reasonably priced. I saw one review that suggested having all of the sounds in alphabetical order so that they’re easier to find, and I do think that would be cool. But this is a great app that’s super easy to use. I also love how I can pause it from my lock screen! The app I was using before this didn’t have that feature, so I’d have to unlock my phone and open the app to pause the noise. This is great."
"8107",960744514,"I play this on zen mode (untimed). Like all great games the “rules” are simple and intuitive. The contrasting colors cancel each other out, making this a superb way to practice combining negative and positive numbers. But The Mesh is not math practice masquerading as a game— math is the engine. Each level prepares you for harder challenges ahead. Mistakes make you work your logic muscles harder. The graphics are elegant. The spinner rewards add a welcome element of luck. And the icing on the cake? It has an end. I still play it despite having beaten it at least a year ago."
"8108",960744514,"Or maybe another new version. I'm pretty sure that people will appreciate that Thanks ❤️"
"8109",960744514,"I got this app when it was free. It was in the beta stage I think.."
"8110",961227503,"I tried to buy all tools, but it ended up trying  to charge $24.38?!?!! It says it’s 0.99. Everything else is great but AirMix is difficult. Hidden charges, brought down 2 stars."
"8111",961227503,"AIRMIX doesn’t work, does it use nfc?"
"8112",961227503,"So I was looking for the solids in the chemical list but they were ONLY liquids in the list, like acetic acid or hydrogen chloride. And there appears to only be 18 chemicals (6 being colors) in multiple varieties in amounts (I think) and also I sat for a full 2-5 minutes waiting for AirMix to connect but it never did.  Oh yeah, it would also be cool if you could select single elements like potassium or hydrogen and radium to see how they react to each other. That’d be cool. Pretty good game/app."
"8113",961339405,"I love this game there is so many things to do and yeah it’s a small price to pay for this 10/10 game"
"8114",961339405,"This is a “Sims” with a prison plot. Don’t let the cheesy graphics and corny dialogue fool you...this  is a great game! With over a 100 characters to choose with different storylines and personal goals...this game has a high replay value. You have so many tasks to complete in order to progress the story line. Survival has never been so much fun! Best of all- one time purchase and no in app purchases. And no subscriptions. Just pay ONE TIME and have fun. I definitely recommend it! AND NO...THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEW! I AM A REAL CUSTOMER WHO ENJOYS CREATIVITY!!!!! Note: Maybe add some more gangs!"
"8115",961339405,"This game is so detailed and awesome, I just hope that they come out with new characters."
"8116",961390574,"Well presented and accurate. This is one of the few apps I use every single day."
"8117",961390574,"Since the latest update, the Apple Watch app on my series 0 does not work. It tries to open for a split second, crashes, and I'm back at my watchface. As a result, the complication also doesn't work. Reboote my watch and phone, still nothing. The iPhone app is great, but 90% of the time I'm checking the weather, it's on my watch."
"8118",961390574,"Best hilarious, non-spying, non-spammy, clickbait-free, fully featured weather app there is. Paid tiers are totally worth it, if it means I don’t get blasted with ads or my user metrics and GPS/battery gobbled up and sold by the big name “free” apps. Notifications are great. Data source variety is great. The update for iOS 13 works nicely with Dark Mode, including a new dark radar map that’s easy on the eyes.  Those reviewers put off by the humor: Understand that the theme here is a malevolent AI that mocks humanity, so if a forecast comment runs counter to your personality or political settings, it’s probably an intentional attempt at contrarian humor along that line. Maybe just turn off the snark altogether to avoid being triggered, if susceptible."
"8119",961411124,"This game is silly, but pretty addictive"
"8120",961411124,"It's a pretty fun game."
"8121",961411124,"This has an enjoyable story and I'm all about trying as hard as I can to not work!"
"8122",961648591,"Great app."
"8123",961648591,"This app keeps crashing!  It's so frustrating for my son!"
"8124",961648591,"The game is constantly crashing and skips pages all the time. My son loves the tv show but he gets very frustrated with this game when all it does is crash in the middle of the coloring, pages skip all the time, and the camera feature doesn't even work for taking your picture with the dino bots. Very disappointed and want my money returned! Not worth $2.99 at all!"
"8125",961662290,"I don’t how stupid y’all are but losing your coins when you try to create a Kingdom & someone else already used that name is stupid asf"
"8126",961662290,"Lords and castles delivers great strategy in medieval and operations that they used back then an every decision would be like the descisions that an actual king would do and make like from the movies and shows"
"8127",961662290,"All the things in the photos are fake u can’t even do them"
"8128",961875786,"This is fun"
"8129",961875786,"Adds between every level."
"8130",961875786,"Easy at first to get you hooked then it gets very challenging.  Good game to play while waiting for an appointment or whatever."
"8131",961889853,"This game is not for everyone. It definitely makes you think. If you’re looking for a one trick pony, you won’t find it here. Is there a challenging category, cause that’s where this belongs. Give me more please."
"8132",961889853,"The game world is almost empty. One side mission, the screen went black. All I had to work with was my mini map. Controls are very touchy, but work okay on my iPad Pro running iOS 9.32.  With some more TLC this might be a good game, but it needs a lot of work and more content. Seems like a demo or work in progress game. 2 stars for effort, but really you need to finish the game.  EDIT: Crashes on my 5th gen iPod touch running iOS 9.32."
"8133",961889853,"In a high stakes game like this, in is hard to sneak around when every time you try to walk with the joystick controls, your dog character breaks into a sprint. And when you try to turn it runs forward more than sideways. That alone takes away two stars from the gameplay.  The story, art, and characters are great, though! If you can get over the control issues like I have learned to, or use the tilt control. This game is a blast that I’d definitely recommend!"
"8134",961932335,"Instead of updating all these little apps can the developer please update AnalogFilm instead? That was one of the best photography apps and even tho some of us have purchased all these newer apps with almost no filters compared to AnalogFilm, we still want the old one back."
"8135",961932335,"I have this one, Paris and Portland. I love them all. I like that it's just several perfect filters and not 20 worthless filters with 5 okay ones and 3 great ones like many of the big bundle apps. Paris is my favorite but this is a close second."
"8136",961932335,"This app has a problem with the default functionality. The exif information in the picture is not normally saved. This error is a fatal problem when arranging photographs.  Also, the interface is outdated and inconvenient to use. There's no update for a long time, but I don't know if the developer will update the function."
"8137",962056217,"I built up 2000 contacts and this app made it so easy to delete 1500 of them without having to go into every single contact. I have the latest iOS and it worked perfectly."
"8138",962056217,"It's not deleting all the contacts that I selected!!!!"
"8139",962056217,"know that this is version 2 because when iOS updates, you will have to buy this app all over again! it’s bad enough that apple does not give you the option to delete contacts, but these people thrive on them updating (which apple does constantly) to recharge the suckers who already paid for it."
"8140",962084488,"th' game be amazin' anyone who doesn’t play it will be in jail"
"8141",962084488,"played through the game in less than an hour, including time to explore all choices available. plot was extremely simple, no “mystery” as described. Game seemed to have a preset path that i couldn’t stray from, not many choices even available. I want my money back."
"8142",962084488,"It would have taken 10 minutes if you could speed  it up. Beautiful music and graphics but the price is ridiculous for the short experience. I will not be buying from this group again."
"8143",962144693,"I love this app"
"8144",962144693,"It goooooooood"
"8145",962144693,"Bruh bruh"
"8146",962194608,"Great app"

"8153",962289279,"This game was the best. It was hard but fun. Now it makes you pay to get further. It’s not fun anymore."
"8154",962289279,"Fantastic sense of speed and really good velocity mechanics. This might be the smoothest mobile game available, running at a silky 60fps.   However there should be an option for left thumb steering (90% of racing games I’m aware of steer with left pad/stick). Same for auto-boost, I’d prefer manual control for that as well."
"8155",962397288,"I was able to beat level 4... after 3 years of trying. I think the level should be made easier. Also I think there should be an end to the infinity zone because it becomes rather repetitive. Great Game though!"
"8156",962397288,"I deleted this game because of all of the ads every 2 games an ad pops up and you can’t skip them and the over 30-60 SECONDS LONG and the Same exact AD IT SO annoying but the app is pretty good but still th ADs makes this a 3 star"
"8157",962397288,"This game has been fun for me, I’m still trying to find an end to the infinity zone, my high score is above 10,000, would there ever be an end? And for level 4, it’s not impossible, there’s a technique, so right before you jump on the square, as your falling from your jump (not off the square) then hold on right, and that’s how I did it! Your welcome! But I have 1 question, is there an ending to Exit Zone?? If there is, please tell me and comment to my comment"
"8158",962473684,"Fun game to play👑"
"8159",962473684,"This game is so good you run away from lava on a snow board this is one of the best games I have ever played on mobile!"

"8161",962566898,"Super fun way to pass time"
"8162",962566898,"Very frustrating!"
"8163",962566898,"This is a very fun game but the last pack release was ages ago. I hope they keep updating the game."
"8164",962680846,"It’s a nice game but every time you pass a level you will have to look at a frozen screen and wait for around a minute before the next level starts"
"8165",962680846,"This was my favorite game until last six or seven months. It started taking its time to download. Everyday it became slower and slower. Now for last  three days, the game will  not completely load. This was a five star game but I gave it one star because of the problems.  Probably should be a no star until it fixed."
"8166",962680846,"Very good game but lately is to slow loading"
"8167",962713931,"Game is enjoyable and fun until you get to the boss in the abandoned mines. Then you have to end it there. Poor controls and a terrible mechanic make it impossible to win. I’ve spent an hour trying to kill this thing. Max level, all silver equipment, oh and the one time I might actually want to use a healing potion, I can’t. Cool game, too bad this boss is terrible and the controls are basically beyond useless."
"8168",962713931,"Controls feel great. I like that they upped the run speed in this one. Story great also! This and Lunar Silver Star Story are some of my favorites :)"
"8169",962713931,"Love Ys, despise these kinds of ports and this game in particular. This game is great on the platform it was originally formatted for (ones with directional pads and buttons), on iOS you have to drag your finger around the screen and/or mash parts of said all the while trying not to completely obliterate you field of view (which is both insanely easy to do and will likely result in getting murdered by bosses over and over again (to the point of rage)).   Summary, this game should of been left to the PSP, the shameless cash grab that is the mobile port is garbage."
"8170",962967653,"Simple and fun game."

"8180",962993853,"It is nice and relaxing watching the enemies go BOOM the bosses are fun and epic I give it five star the only thing that is bad is the difficulty it is pretty hard for beginners and hard to get coins besides chests it is nice and fun"
"8181",962993853,"No fun watching all adverts.  Deleted"
"8182",963034692,"Allow us to them the entire app not just the icon. Thanks!"
"8183",963034692,"This is one of the very few apps that have had a tangible, positive impact on my life. That being said - PLEASE allow more than 12 tasks to be tracked. I would be willing to pay for that functionality alone! 12 is just not enough"
"8184",963034692,"If you are buying this to use on your apple watch, DONT! The app is so bugged it is unfunctional. A complete waste of money. Save your dollars for a developer who updates their app regularly to maintain the promised funtionallity of your purchase and doesn’t run away with your money to creat more bugged apple watch cash grabs."
"8185",963037888,"Can you please add skins it would make it more fun"
"8186",963037888,"It good"
"8187",963037888,"Only rating this poorly because they still haven’t fixed risk dice algorithm"
"8188",963067330,"This game is great. I have some ideas for Cookies and Pets As  Rock Candy Cookie Class: Epic Ability: Rock Candy Bits appear at certain intervals. They give points when collected. Level up for more points for Rock Candy Bits. Magic Candy: Crystal Candy replace Rock Candy Bits. They give even more points. Ingredients: 25 Purple Sugar Crystals, 15 Solid Purple Sugar Crystals, and 5 Sparkling Candies.  Pet: Shimmering Crystal Ability: Creates Shimmering Jellies. Favorite Gift: Purple Sugar Crystal. (He loves purple crystals) Least Favorite Gift: Bronze Hammer. (He prefers pickaxes over hammers)  Relationships: Adventurer Cookie: Friendly (They like showing each other treasures they find) Rougefort Cookie: Tension (Both see each other as bad. Rock Candy takes all the jewels, and Rougefort tries to steal them.) Avocado Cookie: Trust (Avocado makes pickaxes, and Rock Candy gives Avocado metals to work with.)"
"8189",963067330,"Wishing either for a re-release of the older oven breaks, or the old oven break costume. Making the original 4 stages of number 1 and the original I think 8 stages come back with the addition of being in the cookie rush : oven break if you can't post the games back up."
"8190",963067330,"I destroy cats face with my skull melting hole inceinerator. I also resise cats holes and delete holes and if you smell like cucumbers I will smell u fro a mile away"
"8191",963668030,"I think the game is fun but there’s one problem all the other games except for home and other places are locked I don’t think they should that’s why I’m only giving it to stars other than that it’s pretty fun"
"8192",963668030,"I love the game but I don’t want to waste my money for the locked stuff..."
"8193",963668030,"This game is great I love it thank you"
"8194",963753435,"It is soo good"
"8195",963753435,"I have made my best beats here and it’s awesome"
"8196",963753435,"I’ve only been playing around on this app for a couple of days and I’m on the free version. The only reason I haven’t gotten the paid version yet is because I generally only pay for apps that I legitimately need. This one will probably be my first exception to that rule. I can’t play any instruments. I love music but i have no musical education. None of that matters here."
"8197",964064306,"Very bad just one lap thought it was gunna be something fun to play. Don't bother."
"8198",964064306,"It's not really even a game to be honest. You have no control over the kart, only one lap, and looks like garbage. I've never seen a VR game this bad. Above all else at least make the kart take corners like they should in an actual race. It's like the driver has no experience what so ever. Poor 'game' overall."
"8199",964064306,"The game should be playable."
"8200",964351449,"This app is great for trail info and helped a lot for navigation too!!!   One suggestion, why not showing the exact number of remaining length and elevation? Since it my locations in the graph. It is super useful yet it is hard to eye ball it."
"8201",964351449,"Best hiking app everything is perfect"
"8202",964351449,"Hiking project used to make it so easy to see your location and overlay it on the elevation profile so you can see exactly what mile you’re at and the elevation. App is now not intuitive when trying to select the loop you want and is difficult to use to orient yourself."
"8203",964436963,"I say this game is fun for everyone but there is to much ads for new players, who willing to play but still I recommend this game! Also be sure to do the stadiums that brings a lot of fun but I don’t you have to for each day to do a stadium for keys so that’s a problem really perhaps?"
"8204",964436963,"El mejor juego de el mundo"
"8205",964436963,"This game IS amazing there’s no glitches so far it’s soooooooo Amazing you should get this game."
"8206",964738592,"I like this game so much fun lovely and fantastic but the level 756 is not open the key why?"
"8207",964738592,"I’ve been trying for over a month to connect to Facebook and the game won’t. I contact to developer and got an email back to update the game. My phone and the game are updated and still no luck. Emailed the developer three more times since my first email and they haven’t got back to me. Bubble shoot games are my favorite games but this one is a waste of time and energy if you can’t save to Facebook or any other social media platform."
"8208",964738592,"Love it!!"
"8209",964743113,"LOOPIMAL is fun because I like the mammoth panda and even octopus"

"8212",964748094,"I looked for a water logging app that would let me see the amount and the time that I logged my water, but I couldn’t find one until I found My Water. I love that there are also so many options to choose from when logging liquid. The plus is being able to add liquid from I Apple Watch. That was a huge bonus!"
"8213",964748094,"This app is good but I don’t like how there is no way to delete a drink if accidentally add too much of it and you need to fix it there’s not way to edit or delete a drink"
"8214",964748094,"The app is very motivational."
"8215",965000875,"Here's why I think that one I love beat me ups two there are a ton of missions so your never bored three I love ok ko and this game makes the characters just as good as the show and they make the controls easy to learn and you'll never forget them. You can only know how good this game is until you play so please download it😄"
"8216",965000875,"The weed level to hard because the bots lower the spawn time and less bots"
"8217",965000875,"You should get it it's a really good game"
"8218",965096605,"Well this is not a pay to win mindless mobile game.  This is a port of an insanely good pc dungeon crawler.  Graphics are rich, no lag, difficult and challenging. Not for the casual gamer, but a ton of fun.  Best dungeon crawler I could find."
"8219",965096605,"I had originally owned this for PC, but after playing it on my IPhone/IPad the game was so much more enjoyable for me; this game is perfect with a touch screen. I hope they eventually port the sequel onto IOS or the Nintendo Switch."
"8220",965096605,"This one is the one all others are compared to. I kid you not, play this for a while and you’ll want more. Still love this and play it years after release."

"8226",965474816,"Love how easy/convenient it is to make my photos have detail"
"8227",965748314,"I played it and it crashes.A lot. Once I get somewhat far, it crashes and makes me restart. I wish it wouldn’t do that. I also don’t like that is a half screen. On my tablet, it works perfectly fine. No crashes, no restarts ect. This a very frustrating mobile version."
"8228",965748314,"Please fix it that problem when you lose your progress when you double press the home button and lose your progress"
"8229",965748314,"It was a awesome game. I liked how you could upgrade stuff. I spent all night playing can you make another game. But yeah it is a awesome game. I give it 5 stars."
"8230",965789238,"好的不学，净学垃圾呢？"
"8231",965789238,"虚假宣传，没有1000元券。 啥？你是指1000以上才能使用的券。"
"8232",965789238,"The only shortage of the app is that I cannot stop shopping since I downloaded it."
"8233",965965461,"this is my #1 boredom killer. Legit all I do when I’m bored or I have no internet? time to play this. I love these games.. keep going!! 😩"
"8234",965965461,"I really like how this game is really simple but still fun. But there are are a lot of things that can be added, like earning coins  and unlocking new pancake flavors. I think that would make the game more interesting."
"8235",965965461,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"8236",966030326,"So I am very new to this app but in previous I’ve owned Korg triton extreme . I bought Korg iM1 with hopes I could have use for some music writing in daws such garage band . Soon to be logic and I recently got a app called beat maker 3 can this be used inside beat maker if so how can I get it to record these sounds * I’m even willing to pay you for your support in walk me through this process. Please Korg/?"
"8237",966030326,"Some times the patches plug in great some don’t  I purchase all cards for app I think sounds are great  I would buy again"
"8238",966030326,"I was anxious to try out the iM1 app as I was once owned an 01W in the early ‘90s which followed the famous M1.  This app brought back so many memories & didn’t disappoint in the least. Highly recommend if you want a terrific modern update of the original M1 sounds in an IOS app."
"8239",966038711,"This game fun, I enjoyed the puzzles and the hint feature was great."
"8240",966038711,"Fun, Engaging and Challenging with enough clues to solve all the puzzles without being too frustrating."
"8241",966038711,"Thank you!"
"8242",966057213,"Easy to use and give me all I need in just one app That why i decided to purchase life time plan yesterday. And i am satisfied so far"
"8243",966057213,"A seemingly simple App, but VERY useful and MUCH appreciated!  It allows the user to do the following: Create tasks (as many as needed or desired for the day, the week, or the month), Color-code them, Prioritize/Arrange them, Allocate a time to work on one you presently wish to focus on, Designate a break, and Assign sounds to signal the end those times.  In one day, I accomplished more than I have otherwise been able to do because the App kept me FOCUSED on my task!  My thanks to the Developer!"
"8244",966057213,"I set a long break after 4 pomodoros but it takes 6 pomodoros to start a long break. I spent money on this app but you can’t even count the right number in your coding!"
"8245",966099615,"4 stars because although the app seems fine (brings me back to the ameba pico days lol)  , it would be great to include an english patch for it (and other languages as well) , so that many of us can fully enjoy the app 👍🏻 I would play it more often if that request is fulfilled!"
"8246",966099615,"It’s a great game I think I can’t read Japanese so I don’t really know what to do but it does have a really good art style I wish it would have English in it so I could tell if it was good game or not but that might not happen because the developer might not know English"
"8247",966099615,"色々バグ起こってます。直して下さい。アプリはとっても楽しいです！"
"8248",966169065,"Update: there is a mode to play without time limits, so I’ll bump up to three stars.   It’s gorgeous and unique. But hampered by inaccurate touch detection and time limits.   It would be much more enjoyable if there were a option to just untangle the knots and enjoy the experience rather than racing against a clock. Part of the appeal of this game is simply enjoying the physics engine and watching the knots respond to touches."
"8249",966169065,"The graphics are nice and it seems as though it would be a fun puzzle game, however the controls are so awkward it almost makes the game unplayable."
"8250",966169065,"Was $2.99, stopped playing three levels in, was just really not fun at all.  Controls are pretty wonky.  Might be a bit more fun without a time limit"
"8251",966333863,"I could not complete the tutorial with three places merely because I did not set a warrior to the site or some other glitch. Could not move forward and could not move backward to correct the situation. And this was at tutorial level"
"8252",966333863,"Yes, you have to pay for it, but if you buy the whole adventure path youre getting 30 adventures and endless party configurations for replayability.  This isn’t a free-to-play mobile game but you get what you pay for.   It adds an ok story element and great music both missing from the physical card game that originally cost 4x the price of the full bundle for the app."
"8253",966333863,"I am loving this game. I had Pathfinder card game at home but it wasn’t as much fun when we had to spend so much time on figuring out the rules. I love that this takes out the work and lets me have fun.  I really enjoy the strategy of the card deck building and the choice of characters/location.  It usually takes me a few tries to win a scenario, to get to know it and plan for it.  I love the challenge. It is one of the few iPad games that I enjoy the playing of itself, rather than the enjoyment of “winning” or “gacha” aspects where you are collecting heroes or whatnot.  In this game, I really enjoy the whole experience.  I purchased the entire set of adventures, which is well worth it for the price, especially if you enjoy the introduction.  The story/dialogue is brief but funny and enjoyable too.  I am getting attached to my heroes!  It did take me some time to really understand all the rules but that’s part of the fun."
"8254",966509113,"Get it amazing game and adorable baby’s"
"8255",966509113,"ava-rose sesssssssse"
"8256",966509113,"Let’s start off by this is a HORRIBLE GAME EVER! It’s always giving you adds and once you reach a certain level it says you have to pay for it and just NO all the levels are just to plain easy and not even realistic!!! Also ONE LAST THING... honey don’t spend your time on this peace of crap✌️😉"
"8257",966758561,"It’s stupid you charge a transfer fee y’all already take a sales fee smh"
"8258",966758561,"Sold a pair and got ripped off with the fees."
"8259",966758561,"My app is frozen on the same screen and I can’t use it.  Tried rebooting, tried closing app, open back to same spot.  Worthless."
"8260",966764324,"i love this"
"8261",966764324,"I get how it’s cool and all you know with all the variety of music and everything but I dont like how you have to pay everything like if I wanted to I could just surf in the iTunes store instead"
"8262",966764324,"Just needs more songs I think of songs that would be cute in this form old n new"
"8263",966810173,"Good game I wish they made it Easier to Get Resources All in All 10 out of 10!!"
"8264",966810173,"For the starting tutorial, your screen is tinted and your told to click on whatever button was illuminated. This isn't the best approach to teaching new players, but furthermore the tutorial droned on and on... I got tired of just tapping this button and that button. I want to be able to explore the game, safely at first, then with some element of opposition after that. I want to make mistakes and get away with it, before the game really gets going. Please have a look into this. I highly recommend ""Game Maker's Toolkit"" on youtube, it teaches good game design by example."
"8265",966810173,"Great game I like it"
"8266",967351793,"Great app! Love the comparison pics you can make with it 👍"
"8267",967351793,"This app is fabulous! It’s very easy to use and I love the different grids. Seriously great collages every time."
"8268",967351793,"This app is great, when it works! Without fail it ALWAYS crashes before I can complete and save a collage. I’ve deleted and downloaded a new app because of this. It’s been well over a year that this has been going on so any new updates have NOT fixed it."
"8269",967383325,"But it's fantastic!! Brings me back to the days of classic Nintendo RPGs with lots of meta references. my only criticism is perhaps too many in jokes but it's a love letter of a game.   (◕‿◕✿)"
"8270",967383325,"The music is non-existant even with maximum music volume and the audio breaks or stops working after playing for about 10-20 minutes and requires the app to be closed and opened again to recover whatever remaining audio this game has.  I do like the up-to-date references and jokes the game offers."
"8271",967383325,"Wonderful RPG but some glitches kill the experience a little bit... like how the music cuts out rarely or the SFX. But, most of the time, it is there."
"8272",967502646,"Only after purchasing did I find out that the host software does not work with Mac OS 10.13.6, High Sierra. No support on this SW version and my MacBook cannot be updates to Mojave."
"8273",967502646,"bought the new app after having version 2 for years becasue i bought a new ipad pro and the new app is juas as bad and buggy as the older ones. the bigest issue i have is that the USB display extend does not work."
"8274",967502646,"Only after buying this app did I learn that the corresponding macOS driver was incompatible with macOS 10.13.6.  That information should be prominent on the App Store page.  I cannot upgrade my Mac to 10.14 for other reasons right now.  How do I get a refund?"
"8275",967624193,"This game is great for taking your mind off your problems without adding any extra stress to your life.  These puzzles are simple but they still make you really think if you want to solve them quickly. Solve enough of them and you start to notice patterns. Eventually, you learn enough of these patterns that you can solve them without thinking much, but they are still rewarding.  I’ve been solving these regularly for a few years and today achieved 1000% completion on all 8 levels, and I’m just glad it’s easy to redo puzzles so I can keep solving them.  Thank you Lummox Labs!"
"8276",967624193,"Clever, and once you understand the algorithm, the rest is just applying it."
"8277",967624193,"I finally finished the entire game!! It took me about three and a half years, but that’s including months-long breaks (oops). Either way, I finished it and I’m sad there’s no more puzzles to figure out but it’s such a great game and I absolutely love it!!"
"8278",967812288,"Awesome rally game and I love using my mad cats controller with it! I spend an whole hour or two playing this game it’s neat. 11/10 would recommend. Also keep the updates coming! I would love to see new content! It would make this game legit #1 of rally games on mobile! Would love to see more cars and more tracks!"
"8279",967812288,"Thank you for keeping this gem alive and healthy. I love it."
"8280",967812288,"When I down shift I accidentally shift down too much. Please make it so you can only down shift once per click. And make the very small shift indicator on not cockpit view way bigger. That’s it But every thing else is AWSOME but add a practice mode to mess around in and well practice shifting but on rally cross tracks please put more control scenes (auto suggestions)."

"8287",968744559,"This is an awesome game with a lot of cool levels and keeps me busy. I enjoy it a lot."
"8288",968744559,"Oh My god, This is retarded. Instead of a Sonic Boom Exploration game for Mobile, they made something that is actually worse than Sonic Boom: Rise Of Lyric Wii U. This is more pointless than Sonic Dash. Sonic Boom has been ended years ago, and this app has been going down. Make a good Original Sonic Platformer instead of crap."
"8289",968744559,"It does not have all the sonic characters from the classics.Its fun but I recommend if you sort of like sonic do not get it. And why do you have to pay for the extra characters. U should try it out but I have played this before and they need updates. It could be a lot better.and there is only two bosses. In the classics and other games there is most of the times five or six. This game needs upgrades and updates.its good but need to be better"
"8290",968858645,"This has some kind of virus every other time it has an ad and dose not pause you so everyone an ad comes you crash and have to start all over again"
"8291",968858645,"I've been playing this game so far and to Tell you the truth, it was actually pretty fun.Just try to watch where your ads are going, and make some some rollers."
"8292",968858645,"This game had so many updates!!NO ADS IT IS AWSOME!!go buy this app it is AWSOME!!!"
"8293",968907076,"The game is supper fun diveing and dogging the birds"
"8294",968907076,"This game is so much fun! Five stars"
"8295",968907076,"YeeeAaaaaaHhhh"
"8296",968953976,"I wish exiting interfaces or spam tapping was a lot faster so I wouldn’t be waiting so long for all the animations to play through before skipping them all"
"8297",968953976,"Less pay to win more free to play"
"8298",968953976,"Just a couple grievances I can think of atm. It’s not a ftp friendly game. I’m only here for my guild at this point honestly.  The clock is off by an hour and it’s driving me nuts. I’m not sure if it’s a time zone/ daylight savings thing but I don’t remember it this way. Raids don’t match guild fight hours even though the schedules are the same."
"8299",968999008,"pretty good but maybe make another creepy goat simulator game!"
"8300",968999008,"These games get pretty boring after playing them and unlocking all the goats and secret areas I would like to see a new update with new goats and new places but there still fun games"
"8301",968999008,"Every time I play I kicks me out and It’s very annoying and it is not gust this game it’s all of your goat simulator games please fix it if you can and if you can’t that’s fine THANKS!😀  P.S Besides that I love all of your goat simulator games and I have them all!♥️🐐"
"8302",969154545,"I have been playing this game for over a year now.  I have finaly reached the top level status and by gaining more than 5k trophies. I was pushing to get up to 6k trophies. I was half way to 6k trophies. Then I noticed I lost over 500 trophies in a 24 hour period. I wrote an email to customer service. It's been 5 days I didn't get a response from the company. Yes, it's a constant grind if you don't want to buy the best weapons. I grinded for over a year to get to the level that I'm at.  It seems like the company is penalizing gamers who don't want to spend money on the platform. Don't play this game. The company cheats you if you don't spend money."
"8303",969154545,"Too boring game,"
"8304",969154545,"I’m at a point in the game where the only way to advance in the game is to pay.  Where’s the fun in that!  I tried to play the “long game” and collect coins, gems, oil but there is never enough time before you’re raided and lose all that you worked for.  This leaving you with no choice but to PAY to advance.  I’ve accepted this and stopped playing the game altogether.  Which is sad because this game is great fun otherwise."
"8305",969211750,"Problem #1 sometimes when I’m fighting something or I’ve already killed it it disappears. when I’m fighting something, and it disappears I’m stuck in the go forward go backwards   2 when ever the animal control comes to kill me the guy hardly EVER comes so I can just kick the truck around and it just sits there ANND I just saw the truck get stuck outside the fence in the water"
"8306",969211750,"This game is so amazing I love it. Also great for children 8-up love this game"
"8307",969211750,"This game is amazing, now I think there could be some additions, not improvements, but additions. Also there should be multiplayer, that would make this game AMAZING!"
"8308",969247886,"Please make an update so that all of the frozen whales stay where they are after the game is closed out of"
"8309",969247886,"This game is so weird."
"8310",969247886,"I love this game so much it’s really fun! And everything! I played it in til time limit I love it!"
"8311",969264934,"I can hardly read the tiny text! I agree with other reviews, the game is confusing and the instructions make no sense! Only worth1$ IMO."
"8312",969264934,"Perfect for a train commute. Turn based, challenging, doesn’t get old. Love it!"
"8313",969264934,"I’ve played hundreds of games for 30 years. I am very picky and most games bore me. This game is great. It can be replayed over and over because you can change the “tiles” that the character attacks from."
"8314",969316884,"This review might not matter but, I actually liked this game until I got a new phone and when I downloaded it I was put in a different region, I contacted support and they won’t recover my account and even with all the information I gave them they won’t restore it because I didn’t purchase anything for the game with real money, so 200+ hours down the drain 5- 6 star characters level 60 each and countless 4 and 5 star characters."
"8315",969316884,"I’d easily rate this game as a zero. Hope you like a game that takes your money and falsely advertises the odds in loot boxes."
"8316",969316884,"This game has a recently revealed article from the senior vp attesting to the shifting of odds. This is a huge loot box game and having learned of the companies practices I advise all to stay away. Though the odds are advertised as one thing, these odds differ from what is stated as well per player. They discriminate against players based on spending. Apple will not do anything against the company so please do not download and stay away from this scam game"
"8317",969447060,"I can practice with fun!!"
"8318",969447060,"At the title said, I seriously can't see the pic behind it."
"8319",969447060,NA
"8320",969447496,"After going through most of the levels and shooting monsters, it really goes nowhere, and had no real drawback for me to come back to the game. Maybe a story, or better settings would provide more entertainment but, after a while a dark broken down hospital doesn’t want me to keep playing this game. I don’t even remember how much I paid for this but it wasn’t worth it."
"8321",969447496,"I have a iPhone XS and played this game on it a few times but lately it will not load the game. I deleted it and installed it again and it just continues to not work"
"8322",969447496,"Amazing game to begin with. More basic content like more facilities to play and different new weapons which isn’t similar to the others. Also, timed missions or safety missions like guarding someone of something."
"8323",969488951,"To the devs, why did you change up the campaign? It’s not a MAJOR change but why?"
"8324",969488951,"I love shooting zombies and boss events happening 5 star rate get better then all games"
"8325",969488951,"Next September update"
"8326",969589921,"To many ads I tried to make a cupcake but it made in ad not a fan of ads"
"8327",969589921,"It was a good game for my 5 year old but there was a lot of ads when she was playing the game"
"8328",969589921,"it is an awsome app you have to pay for some things but its a great app however made this l want to thank them"
"8329",969934912,"Its cool, its hard at first but after 20 minutes of playing i finally got it"
"8330",969934912,"I’ve always been a fan of lucky kat studios or whatever cat kat but I had just hit 100 in turbo mode and got the space background and I was so happy and I’ve always wanted nyan cat and I knew it would go perfectly so I went to go buy it for 99 cents and it said that I had purchased it but it still remains locked. So I spent my money on something that I’m not able to play and I’m angry that I can’t play as my favorite cat. I want my cat 😡"
"8331",969934912,"Good game just I can’t seem to master it still love it though and it eats time while I’m bored so 5 stars cause this is a really fun game to play when ether I’m bored or when I’m around my dog haha"
"8332",969961138,"HoPiko is one of my favorite games. Not only is it super addicting, but the levels are masterfully crafter, the music is top-notch, and the graphics are superb. And, thankfully, thankfully no ads, because ads ruin every game that they touch!"
"8333",969961138,"I don’t even think it gets too difficult too quickly, but the fact that you have to start from the first round of the level whenever you die is just, not fun. Seriously... I work for a software company, and it would be a quick easy code modification to change that behavior.   It’s kinda just stupid that they don’t pay better attention to these reviews."
"8334",969961138,"I’ve played this game for a long time on my 6s and I’ve recently upgraded to the iPhone X every time I try to load the game it goes to the screen where it tells you to play with headphones then goes to a black screen and just stays like that."
"8335",970021572,"My 9 year old and I are very frustrated. We just paid for and downloaded the app, but it crashes when he goes to open the first level. There are no settings or link to contact the developers on the app so I went to the App Store and tried contacting the developer through that, but it sends me to different app site. Can't even get support. Help me fix this or give me my money back!!!"
"8336",970021572,"My son, who is 7, and I had a good time playing this game. The puzzles we’re only occasionally too challenging for him, and it was a good chance for him to immerse himself in some cool music, and learn a bit about beats beats beats along the way."
"8337",970021572,"I keep coming back every couple of months to this, it's so good. Great music from a great artist & simple but good puzzle routes. Quick way to unwind. 🖤👌🏻"
"8338",970044095,"Good"
"8339",970044095,"Love how easy and intuitive it is"
"8340",970044095,"Its so cool and awesome you can raid get botas and weapons! And even heros! I love it! 😁😄😁"
"8341",970202342,"One of all time favorite games out there!! So good!"
"8342",970202342,"Purchased the game and then found in game purchases available. Or very very slowly earn crystals. I wanted to like it. But you also have to pay to unlock a new set of decks available. For a free game I understand. But this game wasn’t free."
"8343",970202342,"Very addictive. Nice twist on Solitaire."
"8344",970389374,"关闭软件后重新进入软件不能继续播放关闭之前播放的音乐"
"8345",970389374,"I Have Dark mode."
"8346",970389374,"It’s a little ugly but offers all options that the other app don’t have."
"8347",970416885,"How do you use the color changing text"
"8348",970416885,"Free & fun! Update has some new emojis. Yes, it’s a copy paste app - but it’s free & fun."
"8349",970416885,"U can not get it in ur keyboard"
"8350",970417047,"The game itself is your basic farming game. With a twist of actually being able to fight enemies in the story. The constant updates keep the game running smoothly. Every now and then we receive free stuff that keeps me coming back. Leveling is a little too slow for my taste. And I hate being able to only upgrade one thing at a time. My biggest complain so far is just the phones and weapons. A week ago or so we received free “24 hour full gas” and I managed to complete over 30 missions, obtaining equipments, food, and experience. All my characters are level 16-17. And I hated the fact that after every missions, most of my weapon rewards were weapons or armor for low levels ranging between 5-8. I believe rewards should match up to your average character level. Even after watching the ad for an extra 3 chests the rewards weren’t worth it. And my last complain is the phones. As stated above, during the “24 hour full gas” after all those 30 missions I ended up receiving only 2 phones. TWO. it’s almost impossible to unlock new heroes or upgrade the ones you have because it takes such a long time to even get a high amount of phones. And even then, when you purchase the heroes option 9/10 you don’t even get hero tokens.  I enjoy the game. But wish they would improve a few things."
"8351",970417047,"This game is great with the story line aspect relating to the real show and all the characters being put in every season and exclusive season like mission is great"
"8352",970417047,"Download this game NOW"
"8353",970421850,"I love this game, and even bought the additional levels, which I never do. My only sadness is that there aren’t more levels!"
"8354",970421850,"This game is very fun. Clever, well designed and challenging in the best possible ways. But the extra 99¢ for more levels was shady. The game is worth $2 so just ask for it up front. No volume control either. Design you own would've been great too. Still, I loved paying this."
"8355",970421850,"I would have given this 4 stars, but I'm subtracting a star due to the fact that the game doesn't have iCloud sync support."
"8356",970721313,"Only four stars because it takes forever to get 2500 coins for the slowest shoes and the quests other than the endless one is too short to give you half a heart. And really JUST HALF A HEART THOUGH IT MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER TO SURVIVE THE FIRST TWO QUEST and it increases in difficulty as you go which is good but not helpful. The mystery chest is great though just turn down the level it requires to open one a bit and it would be perfect. Otherwise the game is awesome! Has me coming back every Time! Also it is a bit glitchy and sometimes ignores   my swipes and kills me which can be very frustrating when I'm far in but that rarely happens which makes it a slight bother but that's it. Awesome game in general though with just a few mishaps."
"8357",970721313,"I love this game!"
"8358",970721313,"The game says I could get Jungle Moose at the App Store but it said that the game wasn’t updated enough. Please either remove the prompt for getting Jungle Moose or update Jungle Moose itself, thank you."
"8359",971215921,"Worked great when I got it.  Since an update about 9 months ago it gets to the loading screen and completely hangs my phone.  Takes 30 sec to get the phone to sleep so I can get to home screen to kill off the process."
"8360",971215921,"I can’t even get this game to load. Would love to get my money back."
"8361",971215921,"Game will not load. Should have trusted the reviews. Hopefully it will get fixed soon  Update: still doesn’t work! Ugh"
"8362",971231853,"Awesome and beautiful app! Highly recommend it. Very accurate too. A most for those who love astronomy and are interested in cosmology."
"8363",971231853,"This appears to be missing (?) Next update to include sharing...?"
"8364",971231853,"An excellent tool for visualising how the Sun angles work."
"8365",971233157,"The Perlini 105F Red tiger truck is listed every day as a daily mission yet this vehicle is not even available in my inventory, even though I have plenty of blueprints of it to build it. Also it is required to finish a level 28 career event.  My other issue is that rank up tools hardly EVER  show up like other tools, so most of my vehicles are stuck at level 25, limiting the events i can play. Given how many of them are needed to rank up, they should put them in boxes more often."
"8366",971233157,"I have been playing this game for a while, I have accumulated a decent amount of cars at pretty high levels, a few weeks ago some my cars were reset back to half their level and customer support has done nothing to help."
"8367",971233157,"Asphalt is just racing off-road asphalt 8 and 9 is racing on road in asphalt 8 and 9 they are racing cars but asphalt xtreme has rally cars they need to make this game a little better and the first car you get is ford focus! I wish we could get a porshe."
"8368",971265422,"Buffers way too much."
"8369",971265422,"$15 a month for an app that wont open is unacceptable"
"8370",971265422,"Whether it be on the app or on your webpage, you guys make it nearly impossible to sign in as a SUBSCRIBER. Which means I pay $15 A MONTH for a streaming platform I can’t sign into. You don’t have any option to sign in using email and password and instead you are pushing provider services."
"8371",971304016,"It doesn’t have enough stages, for a paid game you need more!  Other than that it is fun!"
"8372",971304016,"the game is too short for $ 6 they would like to place more stages more adventure in a single day it's over.  not continuously but in a day it seems very short to add more estages"
"8373",971304016,"Every Tombraider fan should play this game. Sure there's simplicity when it comes to the action but the puzzles and locations make up for it. I give this game a 10/10. I was skeptical to try this game but I'm glad I spent the $4.99. So worth it:) One happy customer. I hope there will be more Tombraider games like this in the future."
"8374",971329287,"I mean it was a ok app.😑 If you have purchased other sago mini apps. You might like it. 😋It's basically the same app as sago mini road trip☺️☺️ I thought it was ok. But it depends on what you like☺️☺️☺️"
"8375",971329287,"I love this game so much!!! It is so worth the money and the animation is great!!!! I love all the sago mini games!! And I'm 12!! It is for all ages!!! And the toca boca games are also great!!! I think you should get this game!!! Have a good day!!❤️"
"8376",971329287,"So well made, unlike most other apps in the category."
"8377",971414822,"This game is great, I would give it 5 stars if it weren’t for some annoying problems. For starters, when I upgrade heroes it often overcharges me. On other occasions I’ll have an upgrade in progress and when I log on a couple of hours later the upgrade never happened."
"8378",971414822,"let me reset my game it’s a great game and i played a long time ago but i wanna reset"
"8379",971414822,"The game needs more hero’s and more characters"
"8380",971608996,"I was pleasantly surprised by the graphics in this same as well as the story line and the amount of actual play time. Definitely one of my top games available for purchase in the App Store and definitely worth the 5$ :)"
"8381",971608996,"I saw this game a while back and decided to try it out and I was pleasantly surprised at how (submerged) I got into the game and story, the controls took some getting used to but after a few minutes into the game it’s just fine. If you ever thought what it would be like to explore a world after a apocalyptic event has happened then you will like this game and it also tells the story of the bonds and lengths a family member will go to in order to survive and help a loved one. And so the game has a little of everything to offer a player. It’s worth playing."
"8382",971608996,"I loved this game and it would seem that the devs could add a few more chapters. Great graphics and no crashing on iPad 2017."
"8383",971720127,"This is the best vr game I have ever downloaded it’s also a great leaning game about the brain."
"8384",971720127,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"8385",971720127,"When I got this game I had high expectations. It was much better than I had expected! It is so nice to explore. Though, it would be a tiny bit nice if you could interact more. Other than that, make more of these!"
"8386",971756507,"The game is addictive and challenging but the time does not reset at each checkpoint, which I find annoying because it sets you ALL the way back to square one. So when i get far out, I go right back to where I start. Same with the pinball game too."
"8387",971756507,"I was playing the game until I realized that I was doing a level OVER AGAIN 😢😫 I thought it was fun but there’s like 5 LEVELS  how dumb 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😤😤😤😤😤😤 😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😤😤😤😤😤😤🤯🤯🤯🤯😵😵😵😵😵😵😵 I’m ANGRY (edit) I read some comets after reading  found out I was wrong😢 sorry"
"8388",971756507,"This game has very fun gameplay and everything, is probably give it 10/5 if I could.  HOWEVER! This game does not save your checkpoints unless u pay 3 dollars. So, if u get to a high level and have to leave (ugh, life😒) you will have to start back at the BEGINNING next time. I get that the developers need to get money, but being able to save it should be a liberty for all players to have. Maybe there could be a mode that has turbo, traction control, and sheild All on one car that we have to pay 4. This review will stay low until this major flaw is fixed. However, the game itself is great! (But not when u always restart.)"
"8389",971788369,"This app crashes on opening, shows the GSG logo screen for a split second and then closes itself."
"8390",971788369,"Title says it all. Game was awesome when it came out three years ago, promising new modules to play through. Pretty bummed they never added any. Hopefully they do soon.  Would give it 5 stars but can’t until it’s updated."
"8391",971788369,"The game takes a little while to get used to it but once you do it's a great one - reminds me of playing pen-and-paper games 'back in the day'.  The issue is that the dev's have claimed to have additional modules 'coming soon' for a very, very long time... I think I finished the one-and-only module a year ago.  The game is fun - but overpriced in terms of hours of gaming enjoyment if they never deliver on the ""more modules are coming"" promise.   I have to agree w/ another reviewer - if you’re reading these reviews, wondering if you should purchase... the answer is NO!! It’s not worth it unless they extend the game."
"8392",972003056,"Tries to sell your kids their other games, in ad during the menu map, and pop up ads after finishing a level. That's a pretty low move I can't condone or support."
"8393",972003056,"We like it! Great art and music - enjoy :)"
"8394",972003056,"I'm 26 and I totally dig this app. Good thing is that my younger siblings find it cool as well."
"8395",972013240,"Love it, but can be habit forming."
"8396",972013240,"Really liked this version out of twenty or so versions I've tried. But how do I order a copy?"
"8397",972013240,"Boo. I don't like the new update!!!!🤮"
"8398",972319818,"The design is beautiful, the strategy is relaxing and mindful. Music is perfect. I love this app and I wish it would go on forever. Please create more levels."
"8399",972319818,"Very pretty but very expensive for how short a game it is. You will probably be through it in under an hour."
"8400",972319818,"This is the most beautiful game I have ever seen. Elegant, haunting, mesmerizing, stylish and addictive. It’s amazing how a simple and beautiful design, with such a smooth user interface, can create such an amazing experience. While the game is simple, it feels like it echoes life on such a deeper level. Play this game and you will understand, and you’ll admire what’s been created here. It’s short and simple, but very rewarding."
"8401",972387337,"It's hard to believe, really. Even after all this time, L&L still cannot improve the Scrivener sync process. The people behind Scrivener are clearly intelligent. One look at the macOS version especially, and it's plain to see the great minds behind the design. Which is why this whole pathetic syncing process baffles me.  Like everyone, I was thrilled to see the iOS version finally released about 3 years ago, even though the UI left a lot to be desired. Still, we could now take our writing on the road, and that was huge. It seemed like a dream come true... until we actually started trying to sync our documents. Holy moly, what a mess! Complaints poured in, and rightfully so. The developers had completely dropped the ball.  It was so bad, I abandoned Scrivener in favor of Ulysses. I set up exactly the same folder structure in Ulysses that I had created in Scrivener, and every single change on either macOS or iOS updated instantly — instantly, right before my eyes, without me having to do anything. You can literally hold your iPhone or iPad up beside your MacBook screen, edit a file on either device, and within a couple of seconds, your edits will automatically appear on the other device, even with the projects open! The folks at L&L kept saying their project / folder layout was too complex to make syncing work like that. Obviously that's not true.  So today I decided to update all my devices to the latest version of Scrivener and give it another go. Surely by now all those silly problems would have been resolved. Well, uh, they haven't. The sync process is literally agonizing to watch. First of all, nothing syncs automatically. Seriously?? But even after manually initiating a sync, the nightmare has only begun. You are forced to close the app. Yes, close the app so the project can sync. But the fun doesn't end there. To import your changes onto your other device, you have to, you guessed it — close the app on that device, too. What is this, 1998?  Words cannot describe how much I love Scrivener on the Mac, and how much I want to use it as my only source for writing books. But there is no way on God's green earth that I'm going to trust my manuscripts to such an outdated, clunky process!  Not. A. Bloody. Chance!  I guess I'll check back in a year or so and see if Scrivener's syncing process has been dragged out of the dark ages and turned into something that just works without me even having to think about it... like all my other apps already do. But I just noticed that Scrivener on iOS has not been updated in over a year, so I'm not going to hold my breath."
"8402",972387337,"The iPad version does not support iCloud, which makes it pointless to use on this device. The Mac version does but if you want to sync the two you need dropbox. Not worth it."
"8403",972387337,"iPad version makes you choose between saving local on iPad or Dropbox.   1. I use apple iCloud Drive to backup stuff. Easy and free and native to Mac. Why require a 3rd party app? Please add option at least.  2. Offer the ability to export the scrivener file, not just a pdf, etc. I want to be able to save locally on my iPad and hit the sync button and have it backup to folders or Dropbox (whichever I chose). I also would email myself the scrivener file to be safe.   I don’t want to only save my files in dropbox just in case it crashes when I have an issue. I want A local copy. I do not want to only save on my iPad just in case it is lost or stolen. Please fix or I may switch ASAP."
"8404",972426013,"As a photographer I like having plenty of variety in filters, especially"
"8405",972426013,"I saw this in the sale section of the App Store featuring and figured why not. I've been wanting more options for my pics without having to open photoshop. I was instantly happy with the overwhelming assortment of editable effects. And it's only 1$. You really can't go wrong. Great app, thanks to the developers."
"8406",972426013,"I love this app. It's easy to manage, you get a large amount of filters, manual adjustments and easy to use."
"8407",972627326,"You can’t even complete a round without watching ads. You’ll kick two field goals, and it says give up now, or watch an ad to continue.... makes the game unplayable, deleting."
"8408",972627326,"hey good game i mean very"
"8409",972627326,"Where’s The NFL Teams"
"8410",972627811,"Every year this game comes out, and it’s more boring than the previous year. No logic to how the receivers and cornerbacks react to a thrown ball. Constant ads with no chance to turn them off. Ridiculously easy game play. The game is a constant disappointment and a reminder that God has truly left us, abandoned us to our wretched misery."
"8411",972627811,"The game is so amazing I love it so much you get to pick your own team I love it"
"8412",972627811,"I love this game it is awesome"
"8413",972657175,"The mechanics are natural and satisfying, the RPG leveling up is addicting, and it was hours of depth, probably will replay it again later to see if I missed anything."
"8414",972657175,"Please play this game! It is so amazing! The story is interesting and in depth, the places and monsters are interesting, and even after you finish the game, you’ll still have new things to discover. It can literally bring you to tears. I’ve played through it like three times, it’s so wonderful"

"8416",972737732,"But hey, the game turned out to be FRICKING AWESOME when I started to get a grip on the game and use the ""Energy slot"".  What this game lacks, game developers, is a proper tutorial. Make tutorial missions and objectives which you have to pass first. When I first downloaded the game and finished tutorial, I couldn't play at all and were deciding to delete it. However, now once I got to understand its ""mechanics"" and how to use the ""energy slot"" I got from 50-100 meters to 500 meters in just 10 minutes.   This game has potential, not to mention its visuals.  Very addictive. 11/10"

And I’ve been trying for a week to change my avatar picture. I sent screenshots of both issues to you through a Twitter DM. The message I got was that you could not open the links that I sent you. They are links, they are screenshots. Then you told me to read the directions for changing my avatar. I know how to do that. I’ve been on Periscope for years. I’m getting angry now."

When I first got app it was great but then it got choppy and kept freezing and (this is my 2nd review) I updated and nothing has improved and months later and updates later it’s still crappy as it ever was.

"8432",973113361,"Rummikub is a great game, love playing with 4 other human players. But, when said players leave the game, which happens quite often, the bots take over and make far more moves than a human possibly could.  The software needs to slow down the moves by the bots to a human level, due to players leaving the game to avoid losing points. Either that or when a player leaves, they lose what’s in their hand."
"8433",973113361,"I love to play without any time constraint. Leaves me time to think of my next move without pressure of the clock.  Also, my father and I used to play this game habitually and it reminds me of him."
"8434",973324681,"When the app first was introduced, I loved it.  I was able to sent e-cards via Facebook and email with no problem.  For the past eight months, I haven’t been able to use it at all.  Whether it’s Facebook, messenger or email, it doesn’t send the card, it just takes you to the website.  I ‘be contacted Hallmark and was told they are working on it.  For almost a year?  Their solution to the problem didn’t work either!  I think I deserve a refund, and I certainly don’t intend on renewing the subscription."
"8435",973324681,"I tried to send my daughter a birthday card using this app. Not only did the card not send, but they have been billing me $5/month for 4 months straight. Customer service never answers. Going to call credit card tomorrow and dispute all charges. Massive ripoff"

"8440",973482525,"Liked it till the newest update which ruined the game. Love seeing all levels. Please don’t ruin all your other games like this and the new pet rescue 😑."
"8441",973482525,"I’m not happy with only being allowed to play random levels I want to be able to choose which level I’m playing as before. Why did they change this? At least provide both options. I’ll be removing this game from my phone if it’s not changed."
"8442",973482525,"I played this game for 3+ years. I mostly enjoyed it, although it irked me that the honeybees are enemies who get in the gardener’s way, to the point that I sometimes had to remove them. The challenges are a bit repetitive: grow flower until they explode, “pick” bouquets of flowers, destroy weeds; the only interesting part is the changing layout for each level, and dealing with enemies like snails, crows, honeybees, and gophers. About a year into the game, it failed. I don’t remember if the screen locked up, or what happened, but I had to delete it and reinstall it. All my progress up the map was lost. So I started over. This time I decided to complete each level to three stars before moving on. Some levels took more than a month to complete three stars. I took great satisfaction in reviewing my unbroken streak of three stars across the map, up to Level 269. Then, last week the map disappeared. I sent a ticket to support. I got a canned response. Following the instructions on the response, I created a user account and searched the discussions on the King Community boards. Sure enough, there was a thread on missing maps, with a screenshot identical to my game view. Dated 10 months ago, in December 2018. Several posts from January and February showed that the problem was never even acknowledged, let alone addressed. So I sent a second email to support. Got the same canned response as before. Losing the map drops my interest in the game to zero. The lack of support makes me question any investment of time in a King game. I have deleted Blossom Blast Saga and will not be back."
"8443",973482987,"This game is pretty good, and it takes a little luck and it is very easy to control the screen, so I’m giving this a five star"

"8445",973482987,"Hi Scott I luv this game but.... I Was Wondering Where Is Phantom Bonnie? I know there haven’t been all kinds of Golden Freddy’s But Mosty Every game has Bonnie!

"8446",973741088,"Need to fix app. The app rarely loads right so it’s impossible to stay updated on my children’s grades through the app."
"8447",973741088,"This is the best grading app EVER! It shows all the assignments, late, missing, and attendance and so much more! It also tells you how your final grade is going and gives you a guess what the GPA will be by the end of the semester! It also shows you the GPA which is so nice! I also love how it shows you the final grade PLUS percentage! I recommend this app for sure!  Rating: ⭐️🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"8448",973741088,"Doesn’t update often enough to reflect actual assignments graded per teacher. It’s not the teachers because when asked about missing assignments, they tell me “nope, it was turnt in Monday, entered the computer Tuesday, shows complete 4 out 5 on my side, meanwhile Friday still showing missing. Oh yea, the calendar feature is pointless. Doesn’t have anything on it. No early release days, none of the “no school” days, no events, not even sports 😒 can’t even check my kids meal account. Not really worth the memory space."

"8455",974092051,"I'm so glad they ported these to iOS so more people can experience them. These are intriguing and emotional games. Incredible stories, solid acting, and fun to puzzle through. <3 so sad the series is over but the end was perfect."
"8456",974092051,"I haven't played the 5th game yet, but this is my favorite one so far. I played it for hours.. I kept trying to take breaks, but couldn't for long. Super addictive. Great storyline and perfect level of complexity. I wish there were more games like this and I can't wait to play the next one!"
"8457",974092051,"I've loved all the Blackwell games. This is the first I've played on the iPad and it was very well done. The games have a really interesting setting, great dialogue, and puzzles that are clever but not frustrating. Highly recommended!"

"8460",974135847,"Would like to love this game, but... no tutorial, tips and hints have very little context and level 51 has a cloud that mysteriously doesn’t move. If I can’t  win the level without moving the cloud and the cloud doesn’t move... what’s the point?"
"8461",974530923,"I love the scanning feature!!!! Great app overall!!!!"

"8470",974769286,"For the life of me, I can't figure out how I'm supposed to go about removing GPS/location data, which is supposed to be a major feature of the app. The developer website is zero help on the matter, it has a grand total of three items in their FAQ, it's no help whatsoever.  I'm also not sure how I'd go about adding a location/copyright/watermark either, if I was interested in the other ""features"" of this app.   Either this is a trainwreck of a UI, or they advertise functionality that doesn't exist. Edit: the functionality doesn't exist.  I have NO idea why Gruber thinks so highly of this outfit. App was a waste of money."

I have writtent to Iconfactory asking if there is a way to sort the photos but they have not bothered to respond!"
"8472",974769286,"In addition to the same issues others are stating. Other observations:  (1) Many photos in my roll aren't even showing up in the app  (2) You can’t access your albums.  You can only see the Camera Roll and Favorites."

"8514",977091580,"This app is pretty cool for home parties and full of many good ideas but it has issues. I would suggest for you guys to really run it on iPod 5 s iPhone 6-7 and iPads and spend a good time on every effect and function to see why its just a great concept. I have paid version but because it's a pretty simple and cool tool its worth buying and I support your effort, but it crashes and going from auto to manual mix, wave file view doesn't reset to cue songs. There's just blotchy blinks with no wave form. Also this last version has a slower track reading rate to set for mix"

"8519",977242839,"It seems that this is a scam. Don’t download!!!  I’ll include my original review here, when I purchased it back in 2015 for the full price, and I loved it: (What an awesome app! Really like the style, animation and the message of the app!)  And then, the app “updated” and now in order to access the content (that I’ve originally purchased) I need to buy a subscription? What a shame! It’s sad that an app as awesome as the original one got completely destroyed by the new updates (as far as I know the original developer Bobaka sold it to the current greedy folks)"

Not only is this game affordable, it’s also delightful and at times worrisomely on point (no pun intended) with its social commentary. Simplistic in design, yet packed with a thoughtfulness and beauty that makes you remember what it’s like to wonder. In a world consumed by an infinite number of relentless distractions that lack only in true substance, this game is a gem of hope."
"8528",977865620,"ANC shows you the beauty of the world we live in by breaking our world into its simplest forms: the second and first dimensions. Through the journey of a simple circle, you truly discover the nature of the world around us."

Thank you, Amir, for your artistry and narrative. Thank you, Rafael, for an amazing soundtrack. This game made my day brighter.   Buy this game."
"8530",977949232,"Some of the buttons are virtually invisible. This needs to change but other than that, I am loving how you can log things so easily and view them as one continuous scrolling view if you like. You are also able to export your diary entries and that is awesome as well."

It would be nice to have an option to sync automatically via Dropbox.   In other words, please let it auto-sync via Dropbox!!"
"8533",977958854,"I get the premise. These games are dime a dozen. But this one has way too much inaction because it’s always trying to force microtransactions. The game comes to a grinding halt because you literally can’t play because the storage is perpetually full. If you try to set space aside, you risk accidentally collecting the wrong stuff and the buildings take far too long to complete. Just not worth the storage on your phone.

I'm sure that this is sufficient for a good number of people but if you were hoping for a proper replacement to the now defunct word flow keyboard as I was, this is not it.

"8543",978524071,"I held off on playing this one later in the package because it had lower reviews than the other games, but this one is the best! Challenging, but was able to beat it with minimal tips. Amazing narrative, clever and so much fun. One of my favorite games so far."
"8544",978524071,"This is one of my favorite games, but this is a bad port.  First and foremost, the game has multiple times saved on a black screen with music and no graphics.  Your game is borked when this happens.  Ypu have to start from the beginning.  Also, the touch controls are not well suited for the game."
"8545",978563657,"Play icon doesn’t toggle. Erase button doesn’t. Stops playing every time I touch the piano roll even though I’m just trying to move the screen. Looked like a good idea. Just not done well to my way of thinking."

"8547",978563657,"Updated update: *still* a cool idea. Dark UI theme is very much appreciated, as are standard iOS gestures for drawing and zooming. Now: copy/paste? Please? It is the one missing function that keeps me from using this app more than once every few months.   Update: MIDI export: yay! All the other stuff: still want, especially copy/paste, dark UI, and regular iOS scrolling and drawing gestures. Also, there seems to be an annoying lag with the current two-finger drawing: I lift my left thumb but if I try to scroll too quickly with my right, I end up with a stack of notes that have to be erased.    Thanks for listening to your users!  ---  I'm giving this app four stars because I like the idea so much and because even though it is missing some fairly basic functionality it is already extremely flexible in the variety of musical ideas you can take down. I was not even sure anyone had made a simple piano roll music editing app when I went looking for one, but here it is, brand new!  So it is a piano roll-style music writing app that comes without a hugely complex DAW attached to it. It can be used for microtonal work at a fairly rough resolution: if you turn off the snap-to-pitch option, it will let you draw notes anywhere between (Western even-tempered 12-tone) pitches that you would like. It is equally flexible with regard to meter: snap-to-time can be turned on or off, and although the roll itself has grid lines for regular measures, you can ignore them entirely.  Without the snap-to functions, you can sketch melody lines freely, but there is little precision if you want to be able to create tones at precise frequencies that are not on the even-tempered scale. I have not been able to find any additional preferences to changes scales for the snap-to values. And so this truly is a sketchpad if precision is important to your music but you are trying to work outside of modern even-tempered Western music.  My main problems with this app are that very basic digital tools are missing. There is no copy/paste on the sketchpad itself, so repeating structures can take some time to fill in. There is no export of any kind: no audio files, not even an image file of the sketch itself. A dark background app theme would be very helpful for those of us who find glaring white backgrounds painful--or even just annoying--to work with.   This app has a lot of potential. Honestly, I could see it becoming into a synth/sampler that created audio stream output. MIDI would be gravy, if challenging to implement.  At the least, my wishes for added options would be something like the following:  Improved editing: copy/paste; the ability to draw straight lines from one arbitrary point to another rather than being restricted to snap-to-pitch; and making the non-standard two finger drawing/zoom function optional while adding the usual iOS gestures for these functions--myself, I find those gestures adequate and those implemented here to be awkward.   Import user samples for custom instruments.  Export and/or record audio into aiff or wav format.  A sine oscillator as one instrument choice--this would give the app and the user some basic synthesizing power.  Audiobus integration that would allow further processing of the audio output.  Great start. Add more stuff! :)"

"8556",978759625,"Ok, I liked the game for the 1st yrs that I played. The graphics are great. Now gl has gotten GREEDY, they have made it nearly impossible to get all the gear pieces with us havin to buy them in the blue crates with rubies. I have spent over 16k in my hard earned rubies only to get 4 pieces, did that twice. Once I didn’t have enough so I BOUGHT the skirmish hoard(100.00$) still didn’t get all 5 pieces. I swear NEVER, EVER again will I buy any blues. I liked the old way, I’d love it if gl would change it back. The game has gotten that is a “pay to play” . One more thing, the newbies barely have a chance to get anywhere unless they spend real cash. It’s gotten ridiculous and I’m SOOOOOOO close to quitting. They’ve made these awful changes to run off a lotta vets, knowing the newbies will have to pay real cash to get anywhere. I’d say thanks, but NOT."

"8590",979713827,"I mean it’s great game, I gotta admit that it’s one (Besides DragonVale) best Dragon Games on the App Store! But why four stars..? Because it reminds me of “Dragon City”..I HATE Dragon City. I really want it to remind of a “better” version of the original game. But the graphics, game play, and the hoal game itself is literally Dragon City! Please change the graphics to make it look like a “improvement” of Dragon Vale! Evan though I rlly prefer the original game ALOT more.  -Thank you!"
"8591",979713827,"The game is great although after a while it begins to los interest, not that it’s bad, everything just dies down when you begin to go up to level 40’s. Although I do miss the features that are in DragonVale and wish that we can see it more here in DragonVale World, like the wishing fountain, or rift dragons. Also newer dragons could help but overall the game for me is 9/10."

Emailed huntergames with no response. At this point no only did I lose what I invested, but all that time with achievements wasted."
"8606",980241548,"I am kind of surprised at how many good people are being thrown around in this game. I don’t like how Police officers, Sheriffs, Firefighters, etc, are being tossed around. It started to bother me when every time I would win a new character, it would most likely be one of those three and I do not think that is acceptable. This is not my favorite game."
"8607",980241548,"I HATE DIS GAM"
"8608",980274086,"I’m only on chapter four but I dab already tell this is going to be an awesome experience. The game genuinely gave me chills and i almost screamed a couple times. I can’t wait to play more!"
"8609",980274086,"When i first saw this game,I was like wow this game looks good so then a few years later in 2019 a.k.a this year I bought the game.i looked at it and I'm like ""they got editors choice?!"" And after finishing part one of the asylum I was amazed  Amazon you're a genius!!😀👍"
"8610",980274086,"First of all, this is an INCREDIBLE game. I HIGHLY recommend it. My only complaint is that it gets a bit repetitive at times. For example, smaller enemies would just keep showing up and interrupting the story. I liked the smaller enemies, but I didn’t like having to constantly avoid them while I was trying to enjoy the story. Other than that, no complaints. Good graphics, great story, great actors, and genuinely creepy as opposed to a lot of modern horror which is just jump scares and gore. This game does have those, but it also has a disturbing story and a really creepy atmosphere."
"8611",980286865,"I want to amend my previous review. It works fine. And shows the scene. Still an amazing and one of my favorites."
"8612",980286865,"Finally a role playing game that’s not medieval swords and shields. Great storyline, excellently creepy setting, art and sfx."
"8613",980286865,"Will you guys please make a sequel to one of my favorite games please! It has been almost five years and we still don’t know what happens to Erica next. So I, and I think hundreds of other people would really appreciate it if you would go and make a sequel to the game. Thank you for making TIL Mornings Light by the way!"
"8614",980307863,"I would absolutely love to give this game 5 stars because I had a great time playing but Im giving it 1 because there is a major glitch, you get stuck in the cavern with no way to call the elevator down and the only other level you can get to is also screwed up with no way out. Sadly Im seeing a lot of these same complaints and it has yet to be fixed so don’t waste your money. If they fixed this issue I would say it’s absolutely worth the money but seems they don’t have the time or seem to care to fix it."
"8615",980307863,"It said it was compatible with my iPhone yet when I try to play it the logo is covering up the button so I can’t play it. I paid $4 and cant play it. Please fix the issue!"
"8616",980307863,"The enemies are invisible. I have to aim at their guns which are really hard to see. Also, about 90% of the background characters you can interact are invisible too."
"8617",980368562,"I have used this app to cook recipes worth talking about. Great for introducing cooking to other people. Makes people think your healthy and the recipes on here are like for vegan included and all types of diets. He has recipes from lots of countries. My favorite is Mexican I think he captures the Mexican ingredients perfectly for his recipes. Great app and I know I’m set for all his future concoctions. Love you man your a genius."
"8618",980368562,"The recipes look great. But there is no way to print out the recipes ingredients and directions. The only work around I have figured is to screenshot and print those. But it’s inefficient and annoying process for s cooking app. Very disappointed."

"8624",980540474,"This is a terribly designed shmup. Unlike other, better made bullet hell games, this game FPGAs way too much going on at once. Thimgs constantly pop onto the screen and shoot an insane amount of bullets at once.  The first boss has a laser attack that gives no warning, and will almost always hit you because you need to be right in front of it to actually hit it with your weapon.  Avoid this one. Go buy dodonpachi or something instead."
"8625",980540474,"Great shmup with high octane action right from the start. Seems impossible at first, but as you learn to do small, precise dodges and use your specials and bombs often and wisely it gets really fun. I have a few specific gripes about individual moments (boss 4's ""fake"" bullets come to mind) but overall this game is a blast. The soundtrack is awesome too, and the game includes a music player with unlockable tracks."
"8626",980864870,"Good game"

"8632",981035758,"Way better than I expected. Great game once you accept the idea of your character dying in order to improve next round. Easily worth the money.  PS. This is more frantic than Space Marshals, and about on par with Halo for brainless enjoyment. I like all these games, but find Neon Chrome is the most addictive of them all."
"8633",981035758,"Hey guys in your game description for the arena dlc it mentions coop 1-4 players, does it actually work, or is that just the pc and ps4 versions?"
"8634",981035758,"Game is unplayable, resolution very low on 3rd gen IPad Pro, NOT optimized for new devices, interesting that you can just plain lie and accept payment.     Do not buy if you have a new device, just break out the sega genesis and hook it into an 80s projection screen tv and you’ll get same result."
"8635",981305941,"My grandson wanted this game. I have tried to download it several times in the last 5 days"
"8636",981305941,"I paid 4.99 and it doesn’t work at all. Disappointing"
"8637",981305941,"Just bought this game for my son on his iPad and we can’t even get it to play. We get to the screen where it says new game and nothing will happen. Wouldn’t recommend."
"8638",981437721,"If I could give it 0 I would. Literally could not make a single baby without being forced into a trial. A 3 day trial then becomes $7.99 per WEEK.   They won’t let you see the very first child before forcing you to place your card information and we all know how gimmicky these subscriptions can be. Many reviewers ended their subscriptions shortly after their first pic and were still charged.  AVOID!!!!"
"8639",981437721,"If I could give a zero star rating I would! Downloaded the app for my niece to play around with and canceled the subscription to the FREE TRIAL 24 hours before it was set to renew (as the app said to do) but was still charged $8.50 for a subscription I CANCELED!!!"
"8640",981437721,"It does nothing unless you purchase it. So please mark it as a paid one not a free app"
"8641",981535263,"Warning: this game has advertisements. Other annoying things about this app is the unavoidable and redundant score screen that you have to wait like 20 seconds to continue. And one more, the VS mode is funk: where is my 4 player brawl option? (It doesnt exist)  Edit: I just cant believe how badly they screwed up this game. Its like worms 100 years in the past without all the features."
"8642",981535263,"So, all you can play are the AI matches. Which would be fine at a lower price point (.99 cents)... but when you’re paying for the more advanced features, they should work. Huge disappointment."

"8655",981903698,"The Game view doesn’t much iPhone X. The options and tubs are hiding by other tubs."
"8656",982175678,"I was expecting a fun experience but this game is just gripping."
"8657",982175678,"I really wanted to like this game but it is unplayable due to constant crashing. Tech support initially responded once to recommend basic fixes (clean boot, closing all other apps) which I had already tried. It’s been over 6 weeks since I requested support. I got one response saying they might be a little busy. Now they just ignore requests for help. $15 wasted."
"8658",982175678,"This game I gave a 5 star review in the past, but the new updates messed with the coding it seems. During the sniper junction event, there is little to no audio clue in which the sniper is shooting, making it extremely difficult to complete the mission without dying. The visual clues are there though (bullets hitting the ground). When in combat with firearms, you can’t hear the shots being fired. This bothers me a lot because it breaks the immersion to the point where there is no point in immersing the player. I know I’m asking much, but please fix these issues. But, in the end, this war of mine is a great game full of immersive experiences, and requires tough decisions and smart decisions as well."

"8662",982235342,"Spent lots of hours and some money on this game with in app purchases, and moved to a new phone with everything backed up and magically everything is gone. Says there’s no cloud sync data, no purchases were restored and NO saved games were present. Literally had unlocked every plane and it goes back to the drawing board. Pitiful excuse for a simulator. It needs serious updates. Do not waste your time or money. As of this writing the game has not been update since approximately April 2018."
"8663",982235342,"Can you make the map really big"
"8664",982235342,"I love it! I love how detailed the controls are! I would love to see just a tad more detail on the scenery and airports! Maybe a few cities here and there...🌴✈️"

"8667",982255287,"Good puzzles for anyone"
"8668",982354972,"Cool back & forth narrative between you and your protagonist. Makes you wait for them in real-time, but I felt this intensified the process. Reminds me of those choose your own adventure books, but as I said, more immersive. Would recommend those who enjoy a good sci-fi thriller. I see they offered a bunch of add-on. Probably wouldn’t pay money, but it’s entertaining."
"8669",982354972,"I really only got this to play on my Apple Watch.. and it does not give me any notifications to my watch."
"8670",982354972,"…it is so freaking boring.  UPDATE: I just monitored the time I had to wait for Taylor to stop being “busy“ and come back to the game. I waited 2.35 hours for him/her to return and then I got 1.6 seconds of dialogue before he/she left and the game went dormant again. How uninspired and boring could these developers, themselves, possibly be to think such a game would be interesting? Deleting the game now. Also made a mental note of this developer so as to never purchase from it again.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: I see how the idea of a real-time game would seem clever, but in real time when somebody sleeps, what are you going to do, sit there for hours and watch? That is all there is to do in this game while it says “Taylor is busy“? It is just SO incredibly slow because you progress in, maybe, two-second intervals between Taylor being busy doing something and going away. So, for hours he/she is off doing something then comes back and you get, maybe, two seconds of dialogue and then he/she is off again. Boring, boring, boring. Too bad. I wanted to like this game."

"8672",982457990,"还不错 很好玩  This game is pretty good"
"8673",982457990,"没有见过更糟糕的数值设计了。千万别下载"
"8674",982528455,"Great game for a buck"
"8675",982528455,"The games amazing and good detailed but the thing is that I think there’s not enough different guns and other than that the games amazing!"
"8676",982528455,"Great game worth the money! Has good controls and graphics and overall just great gameplay. You will not regret buying this app!!! However please add more levels."
"8677",982763237,"The game itself is great, with beautifully designed levels (although some are a bit too similar) but there are almost no levels and I completed them all within a day. Please add many more levels and ships!"
"8678",982763237,"Outstanding graphics, smooth gameplay, all pieced together with fitting music. I couldn’t ask for anything more...EXCEPT you guys haven’t touched this beautiful game in years!!! Where are the updates? Why would you let this game die? Please optimize for iPhone X!! Thank you."
"8679",982763237,"Love the game it's so fun. But holding back on 5 stars because no iphone 10 support."
"8680",982805507,"After update it no longer remembers your progress on harmony 3 from your other device. Starts over at the beginning. That is very bad. Also, when you push the harmony 3 home button it takes full second to display what the completed game looks like. Used to be very fast. I am going to reatore my device to get the old verson back."
"8681",982805507,"Big fan of harmony 2 and the gameplay, but not a fan of the spinning here. otherwise just fine!"
"8682",982805507,"The puzzles definitely challenge but never to the point of aggravation. Calming music and soft color palette makes for a pleasurable game. I like it in small doses."
"8683",982819497,"It was fun for exactly 10 levels and then the boss is impossible to beat so I wasted my time.  No tricks no weapons nothing I can do to beat it.  Thanks for nothing."
"8684",982819497,"beast game but i beat it"
"8685",982819497,"Very polished, clever platformer with flavor (I like the voiceovers and character names, as well as the appearance of the enemies in particular). I opted to use an MFi controller, so I can attest that it is very well implemented and makes the game a delight to play. I am also playing on an iPad Pro, so I can attest to the fact that the game looks and sounds good on a larger screen.  I can't recall how I came across it, but am glad I did. It's a steal at a dollar with no ads or IAPs. Blessings to the developer for a delightful little adventure."
"8686",982923857,"Very happy that they brought the original back. Enjoy playing both worlds"
"8687",982923857,"I used to play the original and played it a lot! Me and my little cousin finished the whole game that’s how addicting it was this one just doesn’t seem cool and addictive as the first one please bring the old one back used to be so fun miss it actually. Can’t never find a decent game to play now and days"
"8688",982923857,"5 stars just for the time portal. Just like the original godfinger all stars, love it."
"8689",982936366,"Most of the time the app crashes when I try to pull in a picture from my gallery/camera roll. I tried deleting the app and re-downloading it. I turn my phone off and try again. No luck. In the rare moment that the app functions, I’m able to make some cool looking things. I wish the control of the tools was more precise."
"8690",982936366,"It’s unclear what all the buttons do. You if you hit the back button it stars over. If you click on a photo in the cloud the app crashes. Poor app. Wish I didn’t pay for it."
"8691",982936366,"Every single app by this developer on ALL my devices crashes every time I click on a photo to edit. I can’t test any of the filters because I can’t get passed that point. Instead of focusing on how the app looks, focus on its functionality. I paid money for this app, I want a refund immediately."
"8692",983099308,"This game is a hidden gem. It is challenging as it is cute. Definitely worth getting. Hope to see a sequel to the game."
"8693",983099308,"Different approach to the match 4 formula."
"8694",983099308,"This is the most unique matching game I've seen yet! A clever variety of viruses with different attacks will keep you engaged. Well done!"
"8695",983143183,"Awesome game so far only thing is I wish you could heal your monsters without going back home"
"8696",983143183,"I dare say this is better than Pokémon go,I love this game!Its really addictive...but why do they have to age?Its really sad that they age so much that they can’t train anymore...aside from that sad feature I would love this game even more if I could customize my character!Although the ability to customize your character is just a suggestion I bet you get many people asking for things to be in the game.Anyways other than that this game is really good!! ❤️👍:3"
"8697",983143183,"Such a fun game!"
"8698",983149271,"A surprisingly well done game — challenges start pretty easy but can get difficult by aiming for more stars"
"8699",983149271,"Game is ok but you can never get a free spin"
"8700",983149271,"This game was pretty fun game. I enjoyed the boxing theme. I will play it more when I'm waiting for meeting to start.  Good job Ali! Still going at it."

"8705",983826477,"I am a list maker. I love checking things off. Problem is- I lose the list or the tech I’ve tried doesn’t remind me. This app is front and center with reminding me to get stuff done. It’s flexible with when and how I want to accomplish tasks. I love the “streak” part of the tracking. It helps me feel like I’m making progress even if I’m not perfect. Each task has its own “streak” as well as the whole day can be a streak if you do ALL of your tasks. I’ve finally accomplished things like- regular flossing, saying daily affirmations , and improving the quality of food I consume with this app. If you’re even thinking you may want help getting “self-care” or basic “oh I need to remember to water my plants 4 days a week,” just download it and start keeping plants alive!!!"
"8706",983826477,"I had such good experiences with Productive till recently. The app stopped keeping track of my weekly goals and now with the update all of my goals have duplicated themselves."
"8707",983868842,"Beating the last boss crashes the game every time lol. Can’t beat the game because of it.  I guess that’s one way to artificial raise the difficulty, can’t beat a crash."
"8708",983868842,"Thank u for making a fantastic game!"
"8709",983868842,"I was looking for something challenging after beating 9th Dawn II, which took me over a year to finish (completionist-style). Unfortunately, this just isn’t anywhere challenging enough for me. It’s waaaaay too easy. I completed it in 8 runs in one week. It lags like crazy if there are even just a few enemies on the screen at one time."
"8710",983963758,"Super lame. Plus, it keeps redownloading for some reason. I keep deleting it and it keeps coming back! Like Jason!"
"8711",983963758,"This game made me feel good when played"
"8712",983963758,"Very Slow loading, and lots of it.  Tutorial forces you to buy upgrades and if you don't have the resources the game freezes and you cant go on or back.  Dead in the water.  Too bad, could have been cool"
"8713",984394908,"A while back Gameloft (notoriously greedy) did the most generous thing they have ever done -- they removed the Vigor limit. This allows players to gain as much experience as they want, and play whenever they want. This seems to be the only game that Gameloft truly cares about. There are no forced or necessary micro transactions. Spending money in the game will only allow you to advance faster or receive cosmetic items. You can obtain almost everything in the game by simply playing it, although it will take a bit longer. This is the most carefully and perfectly designed MMO that you will EVER find on the App Store. You can easily tell a lot of work went into developing this game. Fans of MMO games should download this game immediately."
"8714",984394908,"Can play game because I have a iPhone Max. They put the button where my camera sits. 😔"
"8715",984394908,"It just keeps telling me it failed to send request or that I have sent it already and it isn’t showing up. Love the game but want to play with my buddies and I can’t"
"8716",984594553,"I back up my old iphone and restore it on a new one when i was about to plat all the styff unlock was gone never play it  again"
"8717",984594553,"Esta bien para que Los Ninos aprendan el espanol"
"8718",984594553,"Me gusto"
"8719",984957369,"很好的应用，每天可以学古诗！不过我记得我是在限免期间下的，不知道为什么还是扣了费？"
"8720",984957369,"可以点收藏，但是只能当天自娱自乐，第二天就会清空。开始以为是我点错了，试了几次都是这样。那收藏功能到底有什么用？ 还有就是摘取是随机摘取的么？很多诗词高亮的都并非千古流传的那句，有些甚至摘取的没什么意义，不知道是不是我欣赏水平的问题。 三星都给在免费上了。通常免费人就不该抱怨，但是希望你们能进步。"
"8721",984957369,"我很喜欢这类题材的app。不过下载了以后想提一点建议。第一，把诗词分类并在设置中允许读者任选。这样做的目的是符合读者现实的需要。一种方案可以是按照主题分类。比如，感时，爱情，思念，访友，送别，时令，风光，重逢，励志等等。另一种方案是按照格式，如唐诗，宋词，五绝，七律，古风等等。第二，希望增加每天能够读到的数量。只能看到三首是希望表达什么意思？只怕会把读者赶跑了。谢谢，加油！"
"8722",985077390,"My family loves this game! So cute yet so challenging. Passing levels gives feelings of accomplishment."
"8723",985077390,"It's fun to play rolling turtle, but I found it's really hard to control the turtle from moving too much. Will give 5 star if the control can be done slightly better. Music and cartoon looked lovely."
"8724",985077390,"I love cute games that are easy and relaxing, but offer advanced challenge too. Turtle roll does this extremely well.  I just spent half an hour casually playing through world one, not caring to collect eggs or stars, and it was really fun, fast, casual.  But then I can return to each level for a real challenge to get a perfect.  A lot of games like this are too difficult that they seem unfair and frustrating. But turtle roll is a perfect balance. It is difficult and requires thought and problem solving abilities and finger dexterity, but it is never frustrating or unfair.  This game is totally worth 3 bucks. But I wonder if the developer would consider releasing world 1 for free. After playing world 1, I'm hooked and would gladly pay to continue."
"8725",985565530,"とっても楽しいです！ぜひやってみてください。👍"
"8726",985565530,"The reason why I put4 stars:  1) highly addictive 2) you will sleep less hours and play game like every 4hours 3) all characters are so handsome 4) you will fall in love with your favorite character (Especially Joseph) 5) your real world seems so meaningless 6) you will have troubles at work as you are dreaming and thinking about your favorite 7) your prince makes you want to read more episodes 8) you spend so much money for your prince 9) if its your first time playing this kind of game, be careful!!"

"8737",985923564,"First, the neutral news. This is probably SMG's shallowest game. Next to the hundreds of challenges in One More Jump, the nuanced gameplay of One More Bounce or even the novel sling mechanic of One More Line, One More Dash is the simplest: tap to jump from circle to circle, but time each move to avoid the colored barriers travelling around each target. That's it.  Still, the various unlockable color schemes are amazing...clearly made by smart visual designers who know what they're doing. I love toggling the different color schemes depending on my mood, the time of day, etc. Really sharp.  The music is also pitch-perfect. Gets your heart pounding without being distracting.  Ultimately, this is pretty much the perfect game for 2- to 5-minute bursts. Just don't expect terribly deep gameplay."
"8738",985923564,"A decent and fun game when you want to waste a few minutes waiting, but that's ruined when half of those 2 minutes you are forced to watch ads! Stop the greed!"

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.  There was a battle between good and evil.  There are 3 colored light sabers.Blue and Green are good and Red is bad.There are also vehicles like the Death Star,Slave 1,X Wing,Star Destroyer,Tie Fighter,Star Fighter,Y Wing, and a A Wing.Also nice planets like Endor,Hoth,Naboo,Jacku,Corusont,Tatooin,and the Sun.And make it free too!"

(Facebook states unusual logins) Now they are blaming me for not keeping my account secured. They did a selective ban and are trying to say people owe thousands of dollars.  Do not purchase anything from them. I’ve spent on iTunes close to 7k (never refunded)and they are siting google which I don’t use for 1800 or they are deleting my account SCAMMERS Over a week massive players are experiencing trouble with connection issues and this is causing a massive problem when ur not shielded or there is a kill event going on.

I have a suggestion for your players like myself who have played for a long time. During your events new players can earn the rare Kongs like the pumpkin and bunny etc and after we have already earned it from a previous year all we win is coins. Maybe you could do a different version of that kong or perhaps different colored pumpkins each year so we can still earn new Kongs too! I already have all the kongs and most of the accessories for them so it would be cool to still have goals and more accessories to try and get!   Thanks for creating a great game though!!"

"8816",989148225,"I bought this game a couple years ago and it was good, but now there is no one in the servers which I assume is because they are offline. Recommend do not download, find a newer game."
"8817",989148225,"Server constantly fails this game is lame all they do is take your money and leave you high and dry! I emailed the company asking why is the sever constantly failing and I can’t play with other player around the world? They won’t reply my emails at all. Don’t waste your money on this really crappy game!"
"8818",989178902,"Timepage provides an incredibly useful feature that can not be found in the native Apple Calendar app, and that’s the ability to show every “all-day” event when the number of events on a single day is greater than 4.  In Calendar, all day events appear in the top grey bar when in day view, but only the first 4 appear fully. All day events 5 & 6 are cutoff and anything beyond that is difficult to see at a glance. So if you are active with multiple events to juggle, Timepage will be incredibly useful.  The reason why I can’t rate it higher is because I do not like the subscription model. I’ve been using this for years and have been grandfathered in (for now) but subscription after subscription just becomes very expensive once you add them ALL up.  I fully like the idea of supporting great developers and their useful products but I hope they share the same concern that ALL of our subscription when added together are becoming too expensive to justify, making the subscription model one that will eventually need to fail."
"8819",989178902,"Please bring back previous interface! Is way too cumbersome now to set appointments and used to be easy! Never fix what’s not broken!"
"8820",989178902,"This is a pretty, well designed app. I used it through the Free Trial period and liked it, along with the Actions app. I like the way they are integrated.  The reason I’m not inclined to subscribe is 1) While your subscription price is not unreasonable, I but don’t appreciate apps that require you to subscribe the keep using them. I’m much more likely to buy something outright. 2) more importantly, you do not offer an integrated calendar app for Android. I downloaded the Actions app on my Android phone, but was disappointed not to find the Timepage app there. I haven’t decided to uninstall the apps yet, but I probably will so."
"8821",989254177,"This app is simply amazing! It has helped me sleep better."
"8822",989254177,"Perfect alarm clock as far as I’m concerned. My favorite feature is that the volume setting stays consistent no matter where i set other volumes on my phone. If I accidentally muted the ringer sometimes the phones built in alarm is also silent, which obviously is counterproductive. Goodmorning never lets me down and rings with the same volume every morning.   Feature req: can we have more variety with the rings? I’d love to have a dozen or a few dozen more rings. I’m not docking my rating because of the paucity of rings; a half dozen seems fair. I’ve been using this for a while and just think that more variety would be awesome."
"8823",989254177,"Downloaded this under the false pretenses that you could choose a playlist to wake up to. What it really means is that you can “load” a playlist into the interface, and choose a single song from it, which it will play 45 seconds of before snoozing itself.  The interface moves as a glacial pace, often requiring several taps before responding.  And now I’ve gone consecutive nights without any of my sleep data registering- literally the only reason I’m still using this.  Add to that the fact that the company is entirely unresponsive to these issues, I don’t feel even slightly confident of these crooks responding to my request for a refund."
"8824",989330818,"Sounds are great and very easy to lay out a track but needs AU3 support..."
"8825",989330818,"The most recent update has made it so iMaschine 2 will only play through a Bluetooth connection or headphones. There is absolutely no sound or triggers when I press play without any sound accessories connected.. not sure what’s happening.. I have always used this program ever since iMaschine came out and this has never happened before so I’m kinda bummed."

"8827",989447181,"Really like this app no bs it is what it is .u want a second line here it is.i've tried them all yet nothing works as good .it comes with all the features. I love the app, but I don't have a money to buy a credit so that I can have a new number can someone please help me to send a money for me."
"8828",989447181,"Great app! Easy to use. Very helpful and convenient. Retain your privacy. Phone is the 2nd line app you are looking for folks! Well put together, simplicity combined with advanced ingenuity makes this a perfect product, I love it and now i can make calls to anywhere around US, Canada, Easy to use and safe"
"8829",989447181,"This is a very well made, functional app for many many things. Don't listen to the 1 star reviewers; they're just poor and expect everything for free. Highly recommended. Serves its purpose. I Seem to have a problem in terms of texts and calls being inaudible as they come thru in real timeBesides I absolutely love iPlum service. The price is right and allows me to keep my personal number private. This effin rocks,, the developers have done an excellent job of providing a service for business that allows for multi regional support iPlum could do with a bit of Canada, US.Finally It is a great app as you can have a second number without having another SIM card I would recommend you to anyone who is looking for another number only one downfall would be great. I think this ap is great. If you want to call/text without the other party knowing, this is definitely the app you are looking for."

"8845",990668324,"Formulas and Stackables are my favorite filter apps. They can make all the difference in bringing out the nuance, mood and beauty of an image. I use these filters for the majority of my creations, and I, like so many other creatives, have been very, very sad and disappointed that Stackables is no longer being updated and available on the App Store, and that Formulas may follow. There have been many discussions in the mobile photography and art groups on Facebook regarding this as the apps are so widely used and loved. Every teacher of mobile art and photography I know, hundreds of artists, books regarding the subject, and numerous articles, have mentioned and recommended Stackables. With the continued influx of artists in this growing genre of mobile art and photography, both Stackables and Formulas would continue to grow in popularity. I’ve been wondering, can another developer not acquire Stackables and continue to develop it and keep it available? And why is it not worth continuing to develop? These apps are so much a part of my creative output, I’ve even considered no longer downloading IOS updates on my devices in order to insure I can continue to use them!"
"8846",990668324,"Gorgeous filters. Gives my images that special pizzazz that I haven’t been able to get from other filter apps.  I also use Stackables, which I love love love, from the same developer.   I’m super sad that Stackables is no longer available in the App Store. Rumor is that Formulas is also being discontinued.  Always a sad day when wonderful apps die."
"8847",990668324,"I enjoy using this app and Stackables."
"8848",990692830,"This is the best game yet it has a very addictive groove to it it just need a little extra. Like how color switch added bonus levels instead of just doing the same thing again and again add something new 😏. I play this game everyday and have fun with it continue to improve thank you for the wonderful game.🤩"
"8849",990692830,"This game is good BUT WAY TO MANY ADDS  ITS ONE FRICKIN ADD JUST ONE!!!!!"
"8850",990692830,"It's a really fun game whether your just in a long car ride or sitting in a doctors office. But i had this app on my phone for so long that I bought all the new ""themes"". The only thing I'd change; is to add more themes because I've stopped playing the game, it became boring."
"8851",990928352,"I love this app. I can’t remember if it costed a couple dollars but it’s worth it (I’ve used it for sooo long). It’s easy to understand and fun to play around with. I use it for my instagram pictures. You can blur and decolor areas to make cool effects and focus points."
"8852",990928352,"It’s perfect has all things  I can’t describe how much it is good"
"8853",990928352,"I’ve been using this app for years. It’s the best out there. Unfortunately I received word from the developer a year ago when I inquired about an update and unfortunately this app has bee. Abandoned and will not receive updates anymore. Such a shame. I would even pay for this app. I hate when the day comes with this app just isn’t compatible anymore."
"8854",991018252,"I have this on my PS4 it is pretty dope and I have beat the game already"
"8855",991018252,"I got this game for the DeLorean and it’s taking so long and there’s so much bs in the way the other racers play. Their position is based relative to where you are, not your own speed."
"8856",991018252,"It is a an awesome Top Gear clone, there is no other word for it, it is a homeage to Top gear even the music is similar, it is a Top Gear in 3d. Awesome. The best fun, no ads, no pay to finish the game. It's awesome"
"8857",991153141,"Great mechanics, excellent objectives goes along with my Fallout 4"
"8858",991153141,"Lotta yeet Lotta skeet"
"8859",991153141,"I’ve played the game before but got rid of it because it was always difficult to keep up resources but I re-downloaded it and now I can’t place people because the game is being glitchy."
"8860",991165672,"It is fun to look at the historical maps of the election outcomes. But I paid for a live update and 2 states that were called NH and Michigan did not fill in. It is no big deal ,but when you pay even a nominal fee you expect the app to work. In addition, the total electoral votes are incorrect."
"8861",991165672,"The app wants you to immediately pay for results so if you want to save memory don't download app it's garbage..would give it no stars if I could"
"8862",991165672,"I loved the graphics!    App had real time election projections from various news sources.   Allows you to flip through historical data from previous elections."
"8863",991357716,"Easily, and I mean EASILY, the most enjoyable game I have downloaded. This trumps Pokémon GO 20 times over, the character design makes Arika feel like she’s an actual person (as lifeline games tend to do) and the fantasy approach really helped me enjoy this even more, don’t get me wrong, I played Lifeline and Silent Night before Bloodline, but goddamnit if this isn’t the best the series has to offer to me as of yet.  If you haven’t already downloaded this, I HIGHLY recommend it, they even added fast mode to make sure you don’t have to wait as long, have fun, and make the correct decisions"
"8864",991357716,"My favorite Lifeline game in the series, it combines everything I love about the games into one masterpiece"
"8865",991357716,"I played the first Lifeline and was so impressed with the storyline I gave Lifeline 2 a go but like many sequels, it doesn’t come close to its predecessor. The premise sounds good but the conversations are boring and the humor is forced. The logic is flawed and there were several instances where you suggest a course of action and she either just doesn’t follow your suggestion or it’s just too plain to see that the game wants you to go in a particular direction. I wish I could get my money back but I bought it and didn’t get to play for a couple of weeks so the time to refund passed. What a waste."
"8866",991558368,"This app is the best thing you could see , it’s still good but it moves a lot so you have to stay calm ! I rate it 5"
"8867",991558368,"I’d love to try this app, but it won’t even run. Just crashes. On my iPhone XS with current software."
"8868",991558368,"app crashes"
"8869",991563953,"Once you get to the higher levels, part of the puzzles appear off screen, and you can’t pan or zoom to see them. So essentially you have to guess. If you can even swipe the tiles."
"8870",991563953,"The game hasn’t been updated for the max sizes, so you can’t see the sides of the board. So once you get to about level 24 or so, there’s no way to win."
"8871",991563953,"This is a great puzzle game. I really enjoy challenging myself to avoid sets of 3.  One note, sometimes on my XS, the tiles shift so they're wider than the phone screen and I can barely touch them. Definitely can't see them, and am blind guessing if they are 1 or2 dots.  Great game otherwise."
"8872",991626372,"Great filters and the sticks are quite fun. Like this over standard camera app"
"8873",991626372,"I like the simple and easy to use interface design. And the image effect features are pretty useful."
"8874",991626372,"The app offers a bunch of filters (most you have to buy) and let's you add cool things to your phone but it doesn't offer granular photo editing control."
"8875",991709209,"Ok, so first of all. This is a really good game. But I have an issue with the chats ending, even when I paid for them. Please update Jeff Kasser!!! He’s my favorite!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽"
"8876",991709209,"So I played this in the chat for Andy but my one problem is, is that the game is called boyfriend but pretty much as soon as you become boyfriend and girlfriend it ends. So honestly I wish it went in further. (It would also be awesome if these guys were real, especially Andy, but that’s not in their hands and we all know they aren’t so I can handle that lol) I really, really enjoyed this game and how realistic everything is! It was lots of fun to allow myself to be pulled into the experience and just pretend it was real for a few moments at a time haha."
"8877",991709209,"Seriously... I would pay money to have Brett back! He was gone so suddenly and he was such a great character!! Please bring him back! 😅💕💕"
"8878",991764216,"OK, so here’s the deal. I use this just like those old “ocean wave” toys. (The ones that came in a plastic tube, and were filled with a thick blue liquid and a clear liquid. You tilted them from one end of the tube to the other to make “waves”.) With this app, i don’t close my eyes, and I pay no attention to the “too fast” or “too slow” because I don’t care what the developer had in mind, I just want to play with the colors. It does fill the screen, but, if you move around toward the corners you will see that the circle is still there. Then you can start playing with it, making it bigger and smaller, and moving around. It’s a not perfect app. I’d like a little more control of the size of the circle, and the colors, but I enjoyed it."
"8879",991764216,"Wished it supported fullscreen for iPhone X’s visuals. Seeing a tiny screen disrupts the experience. Also, I wish it had the ability to keep sound effects, but mute music so I could listen to my own (vibrating would also help at the end)."
"8880",991764216,"A simple and efficient way to reset your mind, for the price of half a cup of coffee. Just don’t expect it to do anything it doesn’t do."
"8881",991897864,"On one of the activity the one with the rhythm you can't possibly complete because it is endless."

"8885",992004655,"مشكلة بتسجيل الدخول"
"8886",992004655,"I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. It won’t reinstall. Please fix!"
"8887",992047786,"Instead of updating all these little apps can the developer please update AnalogFilm instead? That was one of the best photography apps and even tho some of us have purchased all these newer apps with almost no filters compared to AnalogFilm, we still want the old one back."
"8888",992047786,"Such a disappointment. The three Analog apps I purchased (Tokyo, Paris, and Budapest) were totally worth the money, so I was expecting this one to be great too. NOPE. The filters hardly do anything - what a dud. Don't think I would download it even if it was free."
"8889",992047786,"Hnd"
"8890",992051355,"I bout a million coins and it is not showing up"
"8891",992051355,"I love this game I play it all the time but I hate that you can’t  Get out of veichles so on the next update please add that."
"8892",992051355,"I love this game but every time I drive a truck or tractor it automatically moves to another view or moves to a different vehicle it makes it hard too do one thing and then it skips around to something else then I have too go back to my original vehicle I was using. Please fix"
"8893",992140314,"I love this game it’s amazing. I’ve been playing this game for a few months and I’m level 34. I think that this game’s perfection can be raised even higher by; doing a online 2 v 2 battle and you can invite your friends to join you in duels menu or something and attack another duo. You guys should also start people off for free with some gold about 200 gold; because I know from my experience that gold is pretty hard to get if you can’t buy it especially with ten year olds like me who don’t have a credit card or gift cards on a iPad or a phone. This is all that I would like to say thank if you read this.  Thank you please reply for more info about my conversation  Sincerely  “ARTHOURJR”"
"8894",992140314,"This is seriously the best game by far on the App Store"
"8895",992140314,"Great game, except the server crashes during the most inopportune time, like when you are crawling and scraping for a level 9 dual rank, your playing an inferior force, and the server delays and you get your butt kicked. This is a tough game when dueling with other Lords..."
"8896",992140496,"So far, so good. I look forward to what the future updates will bring."
"8897",992140496,"This game is pretty cool...I just wish you can switch players from reserve team to main team"
"8898",992140496,"I started out playing the free version, but then I decided to try the paid one. O.  M.   G. It is completely worth it, and I play it 24/7"

"8915",992730639,"this game is hands down my favorite game. but its been years since ive finished gathering characters. i cant reset it, so i cant re-gather the characters.

"8916",992730639,"I bought the new desert theme with 2,000 stars but the next day I it went away and said that I had to pay for it again. I’m not sure if I have to pay for it with actual money to keep it. It would be great if someone could let me know if it’s glitching or not"

"8932",993160329,"Junk software from crappy company. It literally never worked correctly. Then they made a massive public relations error by stealing from their customers. The app held steady at 3.2 stars because it didn't work before the subscription fiasco. Then decided to charge customers of a paid app, now it has a solid 2.0 star review average. Yep, keep looking. This app will die, they can't possibly recover their reputation or even fix this pile of junk."
"8933",993160329,"So I tried this app again since they gave notifications back to their faithful customers. Gee what a nice gesture. The app still performs poorly.  Messages don't get moved to trash when deleting from Apple watch, when you block a sender for some stupid reason it goes into archive and there is absolutely no way to unblock that sender. You try sending the message back to inbox and it comes right back to archive. What a pathetic, horrible app  This app functions poorly, has devs that continually screw loyal paid customers and constantly have people post fake reviews. Like the one down there 👇  Another paid fake review right there 👇Pathetic app   So according to the review from PeppernGypsy down there 👇🏼 you’re paying a premium to talk to Steven and chat about the crap he screwed up in the first place. Some people are just too stupid   This is horrible run by incompetent people. YOU’VE BEEN WARNED! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THEY WILL SCREW YOU IN THE LONG RUN.  JUST READ ALL THE 1 STAR REVIEWS   Another paid FAKE review right down there 👇🏼  It’s like Jerry’s Kids are running this app. Can’t make up the incompetence.   Keep rolling out fake updates weekly to distract from all the negative one star reviews. Pathetic   See below for some fake positive reviews. 👇  As for the app, it was never great, always had bugs, never formatted emails properly and notifications were hit or miss. So what do they do, screw their longtime customers with no grandfathered period and continue to make the app worse and worse. And please devs stop having people post fake positive reviews as no one likes your business practices and certainly no one likes your app."
"8934",993160329,"ridiculous, I paid for the app a few years ago and I paid for both, mac and ios versions, I was loyal and I loved your app, and then you just opened it for free download and integrated that freaking subscription model with no benefits for those who paid for the app already! it’s rude, guys.."
"8935",993187907,"Don't waste your time on this ""game"" it's more or less just something you download and it just spits an ad at you every 2 seconds."
"8936",993187907,"Horrible game. Creator just wants ad money with accidentally clicks"
"8937",993187907,"There is no tutorial and an ad after almost every single game. I could not figure out how to play at all. So frustrating"
"8938",993290127,"This has to be one of my favorite mobile games. The graphics are great and the gameplay is addicting. However it’s extremely difficult to get any higher level units without in app purchases which kind of stinks. I also think that it should be easier to obtain blueprints for higher level units since it takes so many to craft them. The thing that bugs me most is the time limit on battles. It gets extremely frustrating when you’re about to destroy someone and the battle times out. I just played a raid and I had the gut within my grasp and it timed out and I lost. If you can’t take away the time limit please make the scoring system different. Like the player with more base hp wins or something of that sort. Otherwise this is an amazing game. If it sounds like I’m ranting, sorry just voicing my opinion."
"8939",993290127,"جيد جدا"
"8940",993290127,"Great to pass the time"
"8941",993435362,"V for Wiki feels much more natural to read on mobile. I love being able to save searches and explore them more in depth later."
"8942",993435362,"Maybe I missed something in the description before I wasted my money? I got this so I could check wikis on my Watch, while I’m out and about. This product said it had a Watch version.  You know what the Watch version does? It tells you to go check the article on your iPhone.  Now that is one stupid Watch app, and I feel stupid for having bought it."
"8943",993435362,"Great app. I especially enjoy the map feature. I do wish there were more customizable settings for font. At minimum, a toggle to switch between serif and sans-serif for the main text would be so greatly appreciated, as it would make things easier to read for those who prefer sans-serif."
"8944",993492744,"Great way to pass time and have some fun overall great game wouldve given it 10/10 if i couldve"
"8945",993492744,"I love the ever changing farms and the challenge of the different levels, however the major problem I have with the game is the videos you watch to earn things. The videos of late haven’t worked. All they do is lock up the game to a blank screen causing you to have to reboot your phone. You lose out on the free award plus time away from any boost you may be using. Fix this and I’ll give it 5 stars."
"8946",993492744,"Awesome game"
"8947",993570169,"Super fun to play! Love this game. But, ads pop up in the middle of the game! I’m talking, big, full page ads that you have to close out. I can’t get very far in the game without being forced to fall from ads :("
"8948",993570169,"Way too hard."
"8949",993570169,"BAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDD NOOOOOOO NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER NEVER EVER GET THIS ITS JUST LIKE COLOR SWITCH BUT A CHEAP KNOCKOFF NOOOO 😡😡😡😡😡👌🏻👿👿👿🖕🖕🖕"
"8950",993605516,"This game is the best it keeps you busy and it helps with your brain too I definitely recommend this game you will love it"
"8951",993605516,"I love this game so much! I just wish you didn’t have to buy new cat breeds and just have the American Shorthair and Ragdoll for free. I would also like if you add where the cats meow. I haven’t heard a single cat meow ever since I played the game. Other than that this game is amazing and I love it! It’s like I have my own pet cat that I’m taking care of. Keep up the good work!"
"8952",993605516,"Not sure why we’ve purchased 2 cats, yet they aren’t showing in the hotel. What a rip-off."
"8953",994556645,"The reason I gave you three stars is because I can’t get in the app after writing down the parent name I pressed next and it said “oh no! We are making an update to account setup.please come back soon to join us” so I said to myself I already updated the game. And then I didn’t know what to do so that’s why I wrote this to yo please help my kids love this game and now they can’t play it!"
"8954",994556645,"I am a long time customer of yours,  but without sound this app is useless, I have a subscription . I give it another day or so but after that will cancel,"
"8955",994556645,"We loved the trial so I went ahead a bought the full year. Once I bought it the app never worked, it wouldn’t let us log in to the app. They had horrible customer service. Nobody could help us get our app open. Sad part is my kiddo really loved it. I believe I paid like over $60 for this and we couldn’t use it. And then they want you to ask apple for a refund. And apple redirects you to the curious world customer service. Never got to enjoy this app and I never received a refund either. Very disappointed."
"8956",994624624,"I have platinum vip and after updating, my app is not recognizing my plat vip and points. Also tried to buy something ung used my rewards online and its saying the code has already been used. I buy a lot so I make use of all the rewards I get. $10, $15, $20 I use all I get. Called cust service a hundred of times and they didn’t help. I didn’t feel I was a valued customer"
"8957",994624624,"I can log onto the website with no problem, but have been unable to log onto the app after 4 days of trying. I’ve tried using other devices and it still doesn’t work. Thanks to Champs app, I missed out on an opportunity to enter a raffle for shoes. I requested assistance from their customer service team, but received no help."
"8958",994624624,"This literally has no sizes at all🤬🤬"
"8959",994673739,"This is amazing app I love playing babies"
"8960",994673739,"This game is ffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnn"
"8961",994673739,"Six-year old boy just wanted to be silly with the babies. Flying them around and making a mess with the food. Four-year old girl wanted to feed and dress them the most. Neither too fascinated with the diaper pooping segments. I would have been happier without that “feature”."
"8962",994822255,"Dear developers, can u pls bring back the beta set? I ALWAYS see it in campaign mode! I remember on my old acct had the beta TD body! Pls bring it back and it will make everyone SO SO happy! I can tell players are og is because of beta. If you can write back on my review or if not contact me on username “jones bbq and foot massage”. And put in beta in next update pls"
"8963",994822255,"can i have my money back.? i regret buying this game. i couldn’t find 1 single match to play online all i did was waiting for it to find a match. i think this game is so trash that no one bothers to play it. oh and thats why YOU DONT SELL A GAME FROM THE BEGINNING.!!!! you put in app purchases so they can download it for free and buy stuff if they like the game. but since all you want is money well you’re stuck with a unhappy customer that left you a REALLY bad review the only thing i liked was that i can customize my thank at will every other thing is trash. i actually search for this exact game because i remember seeing it somewhere and i wanted to try it. but oohhh maaannnnn i regret doing that.  i like playing online i like showing off my skills and thats one thing i couldn’t do."
"8964",994822255,"I wish you could buy funds in game because I spent 5 dollars on a game that you cant buy funds ingame."
"8965",994855806,"I had one friend that I was able to play with but I no longer can. When I asked to invite her it tells me I can’t because other Facebook users found the content abusive.  ..."

"8967",994855806,"Great game so much fun love this game!"
"8968",994905763,"I rate this a three because it’s a good app but it crashes a lot. It also doesn’t have enough music."
"8969",994905763,"It crashes wayyy tooo much"
"8970",994905763,"Great App"
"8971",994933845,"🐼🐻could not find ice bear emoji, great game"
"8972",994933845,"I Like this cool game, But it has too less mini games. So please add 3 more."
"8973",994933845,"This is a great game and it has its own show! And it is so funny who ever is the creator of We Bare Bears does a great job😝"
"8974",995022521,"Great app. Only concerns are that the letter p and the letter f is facing the wrong direction. If you could fix that more people in the deaf community would likely purchase the app. Also if you could allow us to change the background color that would really help balance the different colors you have for the letters."
"8975",995022521,"So I can see the handshapes clearly in the app store screen shots. That's not at all what you see when you use the keyboard on the phone. The handshapes are so tiny you can't make them out. For the letters, you can switch to Roman letters to see where the handshape is that you want. However, this only works for letters. The other two banks of features - number handshapes through 29 or maybe 30, I honestly can't tell - as well as some simple signs like YES, NO, THAT etc, unless you can pull this up on an iPad, I don't know how you'd be able to know what they are except by trial and error. Too bad. I'd like to use this but it's not useable on a phone, which is where I'd get the most use out of it."
"8976",995022521,"I agree with what I read from a previous reviewer. I really like this keyboard, the features, and the way it is laid out. I am very excited to use this as a tool to learn ASL. My only issue is that the individual signs are very small in the keyboard itself and are hard to make out, especially to my novice eye.  I hope you can fix this issue soon, and if/when you do, I will be happy to write another review!"
"8977",995112030,"Sure wish this app would tell me when my credit card due date is. Other than that, it’s useful"
"8978",995112030,"I downloaded this app in order to make mobile deposits. It looks like it works just like my other bank, bu after 30 minutes of trying, I gave up. At the last step it would just say cannot make this deposit or endorsement not seen. Tried switching the endorsement from one side to the other. Never worked."
"8979",995112030,"BB&T has always been the most personable bank I’ve ever experienced. Their app is no different. It’s straightforward yet has the same personal feel as every branch does when I walk in. Thank you BB&T for being so awesome."

"8982",995125257,"Полный отстой!!"
"8983",995922287,"I hate this game.  I love this game.  I wish it made it clearer that the helmets are one-use and do not carry over to the next stage with full health. I had to delete the game and re-download it so I could get my coins back and actually save them for the infinite helmet. Which seems ridiculously but understandably priced by the way.  I love how simple yet challenging it is. I want to throw my phone out the window. 5/5 10/10 great game."
"8984",995922287,"kinda rage inducing but overall it's a good game"
"8985",995922287,"Prepare for one of the most rage inducing ""2ball rotating"" games of all time. The developers of this game literally had to have been hopped up on  amphetamines and had a board meeting like ""OKAY BROS WE NEED TO MAKE A GAME WITH INSANELY IMPOSSIBLE OBSTACLES THAT THE PLAYERS WILL DIE BY AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE THEY GET TO THE END! THEREFORE ELIMINATING ANY POSSIBLE CHANCE OF THEM GETTING 3 STARS ON ANY LEVEL! WOOOOOOO!!! WE NEED THIS GAME TO BE SO STUPIDLY STUPID, THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL FINISH THIS GAME, WITHOUT COMPLETELY GOING INSANE IS BY PUNCHING A FAMILY MEMBER OR SAYING EXTREMELY HARSH FOUR LETTER WORDS TO THEIR FAMILY PET! DO NOT: get this game if you suffer from high blood pressure DO NOT: get this game if you suffer from anger issues  DO NOT DO NOT: get this game if you just completed counseling for rage induced homicidal thoughts. Just do yourself and your sanity a favor...choose another game"
"8986",995999703,"I love this game it is my childhood memory but one thing I have always wanted on Agar.io was a PRIVATE SERVER. That way you can teach your friends who don’t know how to play without having to worry about other people killing you. I play on phone and I hope that you can make this happen because that would be the best addition to the game in my opinion! Thank you!😁"
"8987",995999703,"I do not get how it seems ok that you can spawn in for the first time you get up to 200 score then some just splits up to catch up to you and kills you. And you also spawn in right under someone and instantly die."
"8988",995999703,"TOO MANY DAM ADS"
"8989",996136866,"I love RPGs, Aralon is a great mobile one! I played when it came out when I was a young kid and it was so much fun for me, so I downloaded it again now that I’m older and it’s still very fun! The campaign is interesting and fun! It’s not a really hard grind but it’s a fun amount! The game is worth the money, so is sword and shadow! I recommend this game to you!"
"8990",996136866,"More freakin aralon and race sword plz I’ll pay 100s of dollars seriously!!!!"
"8991",996136866,"There is no mfi support for Aralon on Ipad devices."
"8992",996246479,"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!!! They have deleted my past reviews and never update their selections! THEY ONLY HAVE STUFF 2013 and back"
"8993",996246479,"Every time I use this app on my television, I have to log in. It’s pretty annoying that I could be watching something and I’ll hit pause or rewind and it kicks me off and I have to sign in again. Literally, every single time."
"8994",996246479,"Showtime has lots of great selection however this app has to be as non user friendly as possible. no “continue watching” or “skip intro” feature. it doesn’t even show you the episodes you’ve watched of a show when scrolling through the thumbnail screen. if you like having to spend 5 minutes waiting for the app to get past the initial opening screen, search for the show you want bc it definetly will not have it there to be easily accessed like any other media app, then this is the app for you."
"8995",996402903,"Great Fun App especially when killing time on a plane a Trip!"
"8996",996402903,"Fun game good to pass some time when you have nothing to do or waiting for an appointment"
"8997",996402903,"Love it"
"8998",996491151,"I've played Puzzel Strike off and on for a couple of years.   I have the board game version, and I used to play the Free Web Version while I was on my walking treadmill.  This iOS implementation is very polished.  I was a little worried after readinng the negitive reviews, but I went forward with a buddy and we both bought a copy.  It played smooth as single player (and the puzzle mode is nice), and today we tried it multiplayer.   At first we could not get a custom game started (we'd pick the characters but could not start it or edit the bank), so I posted on the Forum on their website, and within 5 mins (9pm cst) there was a reply from the admin stating the Server was in a ""bad state"" for iOS and he'd reboot it.   Well he did, and my friend and I did about 4 hours of stable play across the internet (while running Facetime).  Super solid implementation - though with hiccups and growing pains."
"8999",996491151,"Messages that display programmer info (like an empty object showing as ""{0}"")' no Undo for many actions, and a Custom game mode that doesn't let you choose your bank or start the game. This feels like a Single Player beta. It is in no way finished and doesn't merit the $4 price tag. Keep your money until Sirlin gets their act together."
"9000",996491151,"As mentioned by others, the create account system just doesn't work. And there's no way to contact the developers to alert them to the problem. Which means I won't be spending the $12(!!!!) to unlock the rest of he game. Which, by the way, feels a bit exorbitant for an app that doesn't support pass and play, and since I can't log in, means I can't play with my friends at all. See, if you do the math, $12 * 4 means that you and your friends will pay $48 to play the full game against each other. That's more than the cost of the actual board game."
"9001",996509117,"你们他们什么垃圾算法？匹配垃圾？狗游戏，垃圾"
"9002",996509117,"So I downloaded this game and it starts up then just starts on this infinite loading of all eternity. Been waiting for an hour and it still isn’t loaded up. Waste of time and memory space. Play agar.io or something."
"9003",996509117,"There’s so many buttons in the menu"

"9009",996866372,"越来越差，视频看不了算了，现在文章都是永久的等待"
"9010",996948313,"This game has an amazing story and excellent graphics."
"9011",996948313,"So far so good. The graphics are really nice. The story is good. Overall the mechanics are good. The controls are great (with a nimbus controller) Nothing really groundbreaking or original, but it’s a very solid game. A bit of stealth/action/adventure.   The sound is pretty bad at most times, with volume levels being wildly uneven, and lackluster, repetitive sound effects. The voice acting is pretty bad for some characters but Eisenhorn and most of the main characters are good. While the character models are beautifully rendered for the main characters, the standard for enemies and others is noticeably lower.The animations for everyone are very jerky, and usually too fast, making it hard to see exactly what happens. All this aside, I still love the game and it’s totally worth the money."
"9012",996948313,"I bought the game but it wouldn’t even load in"
"9013",997002798,"Fun! The kids and I love it! And it’s available on the Apple TV… wish more quality games were.   Question for game devs: is there any visual indication on screen that lets me know if I have any boost ready to go?"
"9014",997002798,"Edit: Working on Apple TV 4K! After sending a video of the problem to show their support the issue, they seem to have fixed the issue. We tried the game last night and it worked! The kids can’t be happier. Thank you! This is a great game on the Apple TV 4K.   Only one request, support more players for the split screen view or allow a split-screen with multiplayer WiFi.  Original: After purchasing the game for my kids, sadly they were disappointed. The game loads with a view of winding around a track backwards with a red triangle in the middle. You can select to start the game and then nothing happens. Their support was quick to get in touch with me to help resolve the problem. Hopefully we can be playing the game soon. Please fix as I would love to update my review."
"9015",997002798,"Crashes and crashes. Will not even load the first race. The game loads but crashes during load-up of first race. I turned off all other apps and restarted my Ipad. Same result. Refund plez."
"9016",997362197,"Hi! I'm Instagram @stfambb! I just wanted to say that I honestly use this app for edits! Memes, video edits, and collages! This is my main edit app, and it's so so useful for so many things! I'd love it if I could have more transitions without the pro version, but I mean, I can't complain because I sort is so easy to use and it can get you really nice edits! If you could add anything for the free version, I'd suggest maybe adding more transitions? That's literally all! That's all its missing from what I imagine as a perfect app!"
"9017",997362197,"I absolutely love the app, for edits and just in general. The one problem I did I have with it was I was a little confused on which buttons did what. Also, the picture count you can only use 9. Other then that, I can’t find a better app. The one the offers me more exclusive content."
"9018",997362197,"InShot is truly great. I have had many editors, but none of them work as well as this one. I did buy a couple of things, but they still have a lot for free."
"9019",997446291,"Ok. My highest ghost combo is 35. But I was on Championship II and it said I was on level Highway But the stuff was like blue and it had some stuff from Half and Dungeon and Spiral. And then it was like I was like at level Free and then it was like stuck there. And please don’t make any in-app purchases I want to keep playing Level Free!"
"9020",997446291,"This app has many awesome features that you (and some people like me) can use in the game 1. Clearing pellets for food, fruits, vegetables, and other stuff: If PAC-MAN gets all the pellets on one side there is a special Item that will sparkle when it appears the item only clears one side.2. Green sleeping ghosts and power  pellet chain: if PAC-MAN goes near a green ghost it will get ANGRY AND PURSUE PAC-MAN if PAC-MAN goes near more they will follow their leader the leader is the one in front If PAC-MAN gets a power pellet he can eat them the more he eats the more the score goes up and the speed goes up.My favorite part is the free 🔐 because you can get the PAC-MAN dreams of your life."
"9021",997446291,"I love this game. I love the classic feel of the game with the updated features. The only rub though is the fact that the game is sooooo easy to swipe away while trying to control the game and this always seems to happen when you are in the heat of the battle to stay alive or munch some ghost. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS"

"9024",997811612,"My game totally reset back to the beginning. I enjoyed the game, but not willing to go back to square one. It’s a bummer."
"9025",997878440,"Ok first things first this game is really fun but like one day I asked my mom to download it cause it costed money 💴 so when I first played the game it only took me one day to complete it overall the games really fun so could u please just add more levels it would mean a lot because the game is really fun and if u would do this it would be better thanks for reading this review if u did please put it to great use bye!!!👋"
"9026",997878440,"I love this game but I was going to see if I could make a suggestion while the sea buddies are amazing how about after that you continue on to a story arc where maybe aliens invade Townsville and could you try adding in bliss I love the fourth  Power puff girl and I’d love to see her in action also adding in her powers amongst the other three would make this game awesome would you guys consider my suggestion thank you"
"9027",997878440,"Can you please get rid of the notes because I get so many notes that it's now the worst thing ever on the app like I still love the app and I wish it would help me and many other people so when I got all the stickers I had a more rare chance to getting a sticker and I more common chance for me to get a sticker but keep it up you guys are my favorite people since you made the app so please stop having the notes and I'll give you a good comment please don't go flipping out and update the app again 👍"

"9033",998179061,"1. fix how easy the ppl die. I hit someone literally twice and they fell over and it was over for them.  Maybe instead of dying they can just get knocked out and get back up later? And it brings your mental health down wayyy too much. I mean i know you just killed someone but geesh 2.  add weapons like AKs and pistols but make them hard to obtain (not just laying around in random areas). Maybe buy them at the warehouse  3.  being able to actually teach an assigned classroom as a teacher. This could be done by walking up to a student, pressing the “T” button, and choose from a list of questions to ask. But you would be able to determine if its right or wrong. Could be hard to implement but I just dont wanna have to use my imagination walking around the classroom with nothing to do.  4. Also the popularity thing is really annoying. Maybe change it to percentages instead of grades? (Like in supercity). I got kicked once and my popularity dropped from a “B” to a “C” 5. when you become a civilian, you should be able to have kids and raise them in school as parents, sorta like in your other games when you make out with someone and a kid pops up. This could make it more like a life-sim game.  6. Make 2 handed controls an option  7. Add groups (jocks, nerds, preppy, emo, etc.) similar to the gangs in hard time, where you can join them but would have to meet certain requirements. For jocks you would need a strength of at least 90% or “A” .. for nerds you would need at least A- in every subject.. ya get the idea.  I know this is a lot to ask for but it would make the game that much better. just a couple tweaks and it could be a perfect game."
"9034",998286883,"Love this game! Will there be anymore levels added?"
"9035",998286883,"I got to level 560 now it just gives me random old levels to play. Why?"
"9036",998286883,"I have passed all available levels.  Up to 560. Now I Am replaying lower levels to increase scores.  Please add more levels!!"
"9037",998360879,"I’m rank #12 and going up  Add me: nina_the_princess"
"9038",998360879,"I don’t get it all my friends recommend it and I don’t get it!"
"9039",998360879,"The app didn’t work for me. It simply froze after answering the first question."
"9040",998424233,"Great"
"9041",998424233,"It's very entertaining but challenging at the same time"
"9042",998424233,"Awesome game"
"9043",998528159,"Excellent game, been playing for over two years. Conquered DC with 4 different alliances. Open up moving east across the Atlantic with ships and move in to Europe down through to Africa. Higher levels and different troops. Game would take off again. Don’t stop!!"
"9044",998528159,"Great game to play on phone and pc. Keeps you updated and great for kids as well with parental controls. Another great no pay game unless you want to for quicker options. Been playing for a while now. Well finally got to level 30 and looking forward to making it to dc. Yeahya"
"9045",998528159,"Mine and my buddies favorite game, they call us the old guys all over 50. Rock on..."
"9046",998560520,"Spent over an an hour on the phone on hold today trying to get my login. I have to have three separate email addresses and passwords for three different family members. Great discounts when it works. But cannot  get a human to help me reset my account.  So frustrating - was on hold forever - cut off- forwarded to no mans land. Please fix your service and help me."
"9047",998560520,"Blink health is a logical step forward in medicine. They offer online doctor appointments for some conditions that it would be silly to have to go to a doctor for. Then The prices for a home delivery prescription are way cheaper than if I went to the pharmacy. There’s no comparison. The only low point is the app itself is not the most user friendly, but it’s good enough for now."
"9048",998560520,"The only feature missing is Apple Passport support! I’d love to be able to just open my Apple wallet and have them look at it."
"9049",998936876,"The game is fun but is on the verge of being unplayable due to the random crashes/freezing whether trying to watch a video to get full health, in combat, or pulling up the map. Very frustrating at this point."
"9050",998936876,"The game looks amazing when I have not played it for so long and now that I am back playing this game it looks better than ever with the past updates nicely done."
"9051",998936876,"Please add a joystick"
"9052",999183538,"Love this app! Make it easy to change or add to my order!"
"9053",999183538,"Absolutely love the diapers and wipes! And not only because of the adorable designs. As a mom who has tried multiple brands, they really are great products. And the app is really easy to use! We love our Honest subscription!"
"9054",999183538,"To add or remove items to your Bundles.  Pretty straight forward and user friendly. We use Diapers and Formula bundles and they are the best."
"9055",999535933,"Nice job devs for making this with unity. You took the engine that people make crappy looking games with and exploited the pixel art it can render to make a pretty little game."
"9056",999535933,"Awesome! Super fun and original"
"9057",999535933,"U should make the characters customizable until then 4 stars"
"9058",999702563,"It’s fun, although I did buy the actual hardware Kong MS 20. I also bought an iPad Pro. Enjoyed re_solving the mystery again on a new song, nine icons. I now work with multiple DAW’s & soft synthesizers & can make a song even with limitations. I recommend getting this little brother soft synthesizer app."
"9059",999702563,"I bought the cartridge for my DS-Lite back before I had any iOS devices.  Now I can play with it on a much bigger screen!  Soooo…when do we get it in Gadget?"
"9060",999702563,"I never got the DS-10 plus, but played around with the vanilla DS-10 quite a bit. This app is a pretty nice leap from the original! Approaching this review from my perspective:  Ability to set a pattern length to up to 64 beats is very nice.   Being able to apply an effect per track is great too  Also way less menu swapping here - all the synth stuff (patching, effects, etc) are all on one screen  Way better controls for copying/pasting patterns too. Being able to paste a single track instead of the entire pattern is very convenient   Being able to record changes to an individual knob is very powerful too. I'll admit that this feature could be much easier to use though.   Very cool voice synth too!   This is a must buy from me :)"
"9061",999771588,"I have been entertained for hours with this app.  Like Quell, it gets more challenging as you go on but there are ‘easy’ puzzles at first.  Highly recommend! PLEASE pretty please come out with a second version.  I have restarted numerous times (other than the challenges)"
"9062",999771588,"Love this game... wish there were more levels regularly added."
"9063",999771588,"Fun & logical game. The more you play, the more you want to play!!"

"9075",1000773093,"This is literally the best fishing game ever. I spent hours looking for a decent fishing for free, and this is absolutely worth it. It also doesn’t require internet, so you can turn it off to avoid adds. I don’t know why people say it takes too long to advance! About two hours of gameplay (for a normal person 2-4 days) you can level up very quickly. Once you figure out how to catch legendary, not only do you level up fast, you get rich in gold and coins. This isn’t a pay to win game, like many people say. I’ve shown many of my friends this game, and we are all addicted right now😂 Definitely a must have!"
"9076",1000835177,"I love the ""real life"" aesthetic of the security cameras, and the story frame of finding a suspect. But it's too difficult and frustrating to find the target, plus the ""game over"" makes you wait for one minute after 2 mistakes."
"9077",1000835177,"The game is really good and fun a really unique game in my opinion.."
"9078",1000835177,"Level 6 of the game is just black with no image at all. This hopefully will be fixed with the next update but right now it looks like a waste of 99¢. The last 5 levels were fun though."

"9098",1001247878,"This game is very fun and enjoyable and.... I just love it lol"
"9099",1001247878,"This app is a perfect example of “calm technology” that also connects my thoughts to nature and natural processes. I do enjoy it, but there are some layout issues on the SE where things don’t fit fully on the screen. Sometimes labels are cut off so you can’t read all the text. 😔"
"9100",1001248922,"I love this game I played it growing up when I first got an xbox. I was wondering if there was anyway to get controller compatibility tho so I can plug my phone into my tv and get that real child playing a game he shouldn’t vibe I’ve since forget. 😂"
"9101",1001248922,"I am attempting to play this on iOS 12 on an iPad Pro 12.9 - 2018 model with 256GB Ram and this game crashes more than any game I have ever played on iOS.  I am at the big well. Just walking in to the area - boom crash.  Reload.  Walk in Boom crash - reload.  Then finally it allows me to continue , put them to work and beat up the dogs, hop the wall, start to collect the smoosh, and crash, reload.   I am trying to save after ever step so I don’t lose it all, but the save mechanism is terrible and clunky, it really should auto save to your selected game store, and load to the cloud on a regular basis.  The game feels like it should be fun, but with all the crashing it is just more frustrating that it should be.  Better quality control is needed.  I tried to reach out to them from the game but couldn’t find an in game support feature."
"9102",1001248922,"Amazing game from my childhood, bought before reading reviews  but unfortunately it’s pretty much unplayable due to the game crashing every few minutes. Wish they would fix it."

"9118",1001989098,"Game is cute for kids but way too many ads. Kids are not that patient, it takes the fun out of it. We deleted it. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

"9121",1002132680,"It seems to be a pretty good game, but have uninstalled due to annoying ads and too many in app purchases"
"9122",1002132680,"Courses were fun to play through ghost flags, bucks, clean ball are all nice spices to a regular round and keep it interesting. Really wish multiplayer was more active, tried multiple times for a race but never a result. Daily race is fun although I’m pretty sure it’s bots considering I win every time.   Only real complaint would be to not put “free” on downloadable courses if you can’t play them without paying money"
"9123",1002132680,"Needs an update, no notifications in turnbased matches"
"9124",1002210090,"I’ve been grinding away at this game for literally years. I finally beat it with  a couple characters only recently, and I play video games quite often. So for a game to stump me for so long is an exciting challenge! Avoiding spoilers, I’m just going to say there’s a lot to unpack in this game, plenty of content that’s worth a couple of bucks. And expect to die... a lot."
"9125",1002210090,"Love the game it’s perfect. I’ve been playing for years and I convince people to get into it constantly but boy is the community ready for an update."
"9126",1002210090,"Hard. Challenging. Takes real skill to optimize your run, using tricks and items effectively. Equally good on phone or iPad. Just start playing and learn as you go. Wonderful in-line game."

"9132",1002340615,"It has been a while since I played it."
"9133",1002345611,"Very concerning. In one of the barns there's a large monster hand that reaches out and grabs the hay. This is completely unnecessary and disgusting feature to this ""game"". What on earth is the purpose for this?? No excuse. Creators should be ashamed!"
"9134",1002345611,"This game is very ambitious; it features all sorts of farm activities and tries to immerse the player in real farm work.  However, the controls are unforgivably clunky.  It is incredibly hard to control vehicles with any precision.  I can't imagine 4-year-olds having a lot of success with this game.  I think the developers did try to make a good game, but came up way short in terms of control."
"9135",1002345611,"This is by far the best and most intuitive farm simulator game for my family. My son absolutely loves this game!"

"9147",1002597082,"You guys should check the questions and answers weekly or so because there has been some questions I get wrong because the answer changes later on in the show. There has been many errors on Jane the virgin, I’ve gotten some “wrong” because of this. Please fix. Other than that the game is fun."
"9148",1002739417,"Did not boot right the first time for me but WOW! This is the first app that I found that even comes close to VR!"
"9149",1002739417,"Not to be cheap but $2 is probably more reasonable. The view drifting forces you to slowly spin in a circle while you're playing to stay centered, which eventually makes you dizzy. Nonetheless the game changes enough to not be monotonous and is fun for 15 minutes or so at a time."
"9150",1002739417,"I am hooked on this game!!! Very good for psychotherapy. :)"
"9151",1003138996,"Huge fan here! Our table-top version is nearly worn out as BH2045 has remained a house favorite since its release. My kids love it, as do a number of friends who almost always request a game when visiting for dinner.  Easy to learn and fun to play, but strategy options run deep and evolve from game to game thanks to a variety of base teams and the ever-changing free agent pool. The game is perfect as is, but I highly recommend adding expansion pack #1 for either version (physical & digital). I find myself playing with it far more than without (Mookie Rivers for life!).  My only request for the devs is to make the base team expansions available in the app. I would be more than happy to pay for the depth and variety those different veteran lineups provide. Regardless, thank you for creating such a wonderful game!"
"9152",1003138996,"I enjoy the board game and love this version. The expansion makes for a variety of games. Would like to see total win loss records or stats for a team saved. Thanks for less sleep Where are the other teams and more game content?"
"9153",1003138996,"App needs a little work just to make it look more modern. Animations can be a little much when playing someone else. Would love to see more teams and expansions added. Gameplay wise the app is worth every penny."

"9155",1003168863,"ITS A GODLY CONSIDERING I NEVER THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A BLEACH GAME ON MOBILE AND IT IS THE BEST ONE"
"9156",1003168863,"I love bleach. This game delivers what I am looking for to keep the dream of it returned alive.   There isn’t enough to keep you going. You get 45-60 days worth of things to do for orbs and then you are done. This game needs more ways you can earn orbs or a higher output of them for daily/weekly missions. There’s a point where ALL players will earn just 1 - 5 orbs a day. Why?   Characters. The only way to get 5* characters is from “Gachas” those who don’t know what gachas are, it’s a lottery that starts at 25 for 1 character or 250 for 10. How tough are these lotteries? Well I’ve been trying for the last 5 days to get 1 person. That’s how tough.   KLab, just like any other game is greedy for money. But this game, orbs are way overpriced. And I mean way overpriced and this is coming from someone who’s spent 300$+ on a mobile game.   I want to love this game, I just can’t. After 2-3 weeks the fun is gone. KLab if you are reading this, insert more way to get orbs guys. Till then, sorry but I gotta step away."
"9157",1003201868,"I love this game but.. it's just adds and more ADDS 😤😰 I don't know because there just scamming for money and if u load this game u will somehow regret it.... I mean it's good but.. ya....... PLEASE JUST STOP ASKING 4 MONEY"

"9160",1003287840,"The gameplay is pretty fun, but the graphics are a let down.  Maybe some low poly graphics??  I would love a game like that."

"9162",1003287840,NA
"9163",1003716367,"Plenty of skill and strategy will be needed if you are going to make it through this game, Ellipsis. In this game you will have to navigate, using your finger on the touch-screen, a circle around the level avoiding enemies, traps, and other dangers. You will also be tasked with collecting at least four of the circle objects on the screen, but there is a catch... You see not only do you have to make contact with each of these spots on the screen, but you will have to have precision, otherwise you're not going to be able to collect all the dots inside the circles.   The dots will tell you what your final score will be, and of course the object of any game is you're going to want to catch them all. That being said, if you are a true gamer you're going to want to do speed runs in already conquered levels so that you can unlock an additional star to add to your overall score.  I had the chance to first find out about this game when I went to MomoCon, and the neon colors of the game, and the simplicity of the design drew me in. This is a very polished game, and it has one of the best features in my mind when it comes to games that are going to require you to constantly have your finger on the screen and that is instant pause if your finger leaves the screen. Holy crap, that feature alone is awesome.  The levels are quick, there's infinite tries per level, and if you start really advancing through the game different paths open up that reconnect further down the line, so there's a chance that you can get through the game without having to take on every single level, but trust me when I say, you're going to want to beat every level. Personally the feeling of accomplishment when you finally defeat a level that has thwarted you is unreal.  Alright so lets get a little bit more into the game. This of course is a game in which you are going to be guiding your circle, with the help of your finger, around the screen to specific points, each of these points has small bubbles/circles inside of them, if you just skim the point the bubbles/circles will be released into the level. You can choose not to pursue them, but you will docked at the end of the level. Each time you hit a point a new one appears, so you won't know where all of them are until you've played through the level at least once. As stated before there's always going to be an optional fifth point that will pop up at the same time that the portal shows up. To end the level you have to go through the portal, just make sure that you go between the edges of the portal and not right at the portal, I learned the hard way that you're going to bounce off of the edge and if you're being chased by something nasty, you're probably going to have to replay the level.  There is one more thing I want to say about this game and that is the game map. As you play through the game you get a new area unlocked, and the developers could have just given you linear dots on the screen with a description, but not with this game. It basically feels like you're unlocking a futuristic arcade like world where the area dots form an ever growing constellation. So with that I think you can all tell that this game, in my opinion, is solid and definitely worth your time, especially at a very reasonable price. This game gets a 9.3 out of 10."
"9164",1003716367,"Perfect example of a very inspired and well designed iOS game. Combined both quick reflexes and puzzles. The graphics are made up of simple lines, but they glow and reflect inward with depth and outward towards the player and is a  stunning effect.   The game teaches the player without the aid of any text. Everything is minimized to focus on engaging gameplay and nothing else.   The music and sound and non repetitive and changes depending on the players actions, and its ambience fits perfectly with its glowy graphics.   Throughout completing stages, the map slowly reveals itself and can be zoomed out to see its detailed beauty.. Something you'll wish you could print out and hang on your wall."
"9165",1003716367,"Amazing and beautiful visuals! Very cool!"
"9166",1003820457,"Look I know that you want money  but  i don’t think that ur thinking right abt member items but some people who have membership are happy some don’t feel bad for the nonmembers a lot of non members like me myself feel like ur forcing ppl to buy it but as long as those updates keep coming animal jam is gonna turn into the most hated game ever. 😐😯😕😮😤😤😯🤬🤬🤬☹️☹️☹️💔💔💔 how nonmembers feel about membership"
"9167",1003820457,"So AJ is like my favorite app but the only thing I can say is that people with out membership should be treated the same mostly like getting sapphires and special items is ok because they payed for a membership but the whole they get a shop for there den and we don’t and they have there own private island is a bit much I mean really just because there members doesn’t mean they should get everything so... that’s what I think should change other then that awesome game 😁"
"9168",1003820457,"Ajow is turning into the pc version!!! No nonmember likesthta version due to nonmembers being able to buy the worst stuff and nothing more than a PIG. Compared to members that PAY for it they gt EVERYTHING, lots of saphires, all the items, all the best animals, and shops and pets!!!! If ajpw turns into that version... Well lets just say that you will lose ALOT of nonmembers and members. If it turns into member world. Members will quit because they turn into nonmembers. They lose their buddy’s cuz they all quit. Not to mention scammers, bullies and others will rule this world. It’s the only game that’s actually free unlike the pc version. Even if you dont read recommendations, reviews or other ppls reports, please read this one and don’t turn it into member world. I felt disappointed at this update of mokuahi. And with Leilani. I mean it’s really strange but nobody minds. Not to mention NOW you can’t go ANYWHERE whitout someoen advertising their shop while someone’s fighting cuz of dumb reasons. Nonmembers get into fights. Members get into fights. They all fight over many reasons but mainly one: These member updates. I can’t go anywhere without disagreeing about something with someone. The rate of scammers also rose. And not to mention that shops are tricking jammers out of their money. So what I mean is, Please actually DO something!!!!! This summer i got scammed. I did everything I could. I visited AJPW help center, begged for my scammed items back through the wierd box next to the news stand next to the sapphire shop. I’m having the worst days of my life in Aj. Ajpw used to be a great game, friendly jammers role playing here and there, others just complementing and getting adopted in the pillow room.  Others gifting the rest with their items not caring about scams. But now it’s the opposite, Roleplayers begging for fun, everyone fighting and scamming, the nonmembers that felt terrible quitting. Since you haven’t done ANyThing I’ll paint you a clear picture. Ajpw closing down, for five years. It will be club penguin all over again but worse. Also I checked through a lot of reviews and found out you monitor chats. Due to this you could have stopped scammers!!! I myself try to stop scammers. Look at Lavaslove119. She scammed my golden water wings, Golden eagle helmet, fishbowl hat, forest tail. I replaced all of these except the golden water wings. I have golden gingerbread wings and I absolutely despise you haven’t done anything!!!! Ill be waiting for eternity if u respond"
"9169",1003822659,"Pls, pls read! Warning: It’s a bit long(:.  First suggestion: Can we change eye color? And the color wheel should have black and white furs so we won’t need that fur pattern. Not to be rude, but the color wheel dose’t work well. It looks the same kinda. Add more more fur patterns! Second suggestion: Farms and villages! Players can snatch a yummy chicken or turkey from the farm and chow down! But it isn't so simple, you must watch out for the angry and strong farmers................(Btw you need to drag a cow, and dragging is slow.) You can eat food from the trash in villages. But lots of animal control are in there, and won’t hesitate to kill you. If they DON’t fight you, they lock you in cages and you need to break out of the cage by solving puzzles and riddles, then you must defeat the guards to run to freedom.  Third suggestion: A hidden temple and hunter traps. In the panther simulator there are lots of hunter traps like quicksand and painful steel traps. You also rescue you mate from a hidden temple. Add this here pls.  Fourth suggestion: Quests and multiplayer packs.All sorts of quest from a quest where you have to kill a evil giant snake to a quest where you must deliver meats to another wolf pack. I want multiplayer wolf packs too. You can do multiplayer or normal. It’s your choice. Fifth suggestion: Multiplayer! With chat and multiplayer packs. Sixth suggestion: More realistic things. In the settings there is normal mode and hard mode. Normal is what it is now. And in hard mode it should take at least 3 adult wolves to kill a deer. In real life deer are stronger. When you are close to killing a animal it flees. Can it be slower because it is hurt? It also should get tired from running. Prey should be in small groups to defend themselves. So far only foxes and wolves are in groups. Also, when you kill something it always moves around. It’s supposed to be dead! Creepy. Either fix the rainbow wheel or get rid of it. It’s unrealistic to find a wolf with blue fur. I will repeat: Black and white should not be a fur pattern. It should be on the bottom in words. Please please please make us be able to change eye color.  Last suggestion: Wings, coins, free things! Please add wings. Dragon wings to angel fluffy wings, you can unlock them and tint them in any color you want, and you can fly  with them. Another suggestion is that you can make your games FREE. That may sound BIZZARE. How will you make money? Well, you can still get it for 0.99. But, in the free games you need coins to get fur patterns, wings, skills, buffs, and more. You earn coins for completing quests and a little for defeating animals. Quick suggestions: To be more realistic, it should take a LONG time to eat large animals like deer and even bears especially if your a lone wolf. More quick suggestions: And we should be able to bury it.  Seasons please? In the fall you can store up food since hunting gets a bit harder in the winter. Leaves are falling, trees are changing color...... all that stuff. In the winter there is snow and less animals to hunt. Some ponds are frozen over, so to drink you can steal water from humans or search for ponds and lakes that aren’t frozen. You can even see humans skiing.  In the spring lots of baby animals are out- great for hunting. But they are with angry mothers you must kill first. Trees, flowers, green plants....... people plant gardens. By the way wolves can eat fruit, so a little strawberry would be a yummy snack. Food is plentiful.  I the summer green and food is also common. But more sunshine and humans! A little buggy problem is that say if you send your pack to kill a sheep, the sheep wants to kill YOU! And I don’t like you need to be so close to kill it. Also, get rid of eating wolves pls. It sounds....... gross. Like a human eating a human. Anyway this is a good game and should be rated like 5+ or something without the blood effects. Write that under the rating! Note to parents: you can turn off the blood effects and they aren’t gross. Giving birth isn't yucky either. A small version of yourself pops up. Get this app if you want to! By the way Gluten free games this is very realistic otherwise. The graphics are great. I love when you jump in water it makes a splash with cute bubbles flying. Another game suggestion: Ultimate prehistoric simulator. There are all the species of Dinos in the ultimate plus sabertooth tiger and  wooly mammoths. There is also cavemen, but you don’t play as them. And also Ultimate Fantasy or Mythology simulator!  Hellhound, Cerberus,(you get to guard the underworld in the game pls) hydra, Nemean lion, chimera and more! Make it realistic monster tasks pls.  That’s it!"
"9170",1003822659,"One day a wolf was born with 5 others my mothers name was rain  and loved the litter but as I grew  my mother  didn’t treat me well I was the new alpha  and i said “everyone I need my hunters to go hunt as much as you can and in fact everyone even me go hunt” then everybody went of to hunt and they came back with a bear a rabbit  a buffalo a deer a elk a goat and I got a crocodile then the pack said “kick him out he’s 3 days old get him rain then I was scared  😱 my mother grabbed me by the ear and put me out side in the rain I was shocked    I was put in a cage by humans and was taken to the zoo and I was very scared it was scary a lot humans were looking at me I ran in to a rock  but every human was chucking  then I ran in a log and hid  the humans left  me alone and went away I was fed some meat 🍖 but I saw the door open I ran out and the humans ran after me but i escaped my mom was now scared I ran back to the pack but I got lost  but then I saw my moms tail and ran and my mom was so happy she was crying  and fed me lots a meat I was a adult now I was the alpha that’s the end of whispers story 👋🏻"
"9171",1003822659,"Hi awesome game.I love 💗 your simulators.but there are some bugs in the game.whenever I would eat something my pack would drag my food away and my pack would sometimes fly after eating.I reached level 61 in the game and there’s nothing to  do anymore.😳it would be amazing if you made a new simulator!like a ultimate mountain 🏔 simulator with ten animals.cougar, big horn sheep, bald eagle, badger, hare, red panda, chipmunk, skunk, owl, and a fox.thats  all I have to say but please continue gluten free games🐾thanks for reading.bye."

"9179",1004227662,"And I would perhaps pay for this game, if I could actually get to playing it instead of waitin through ads take up more game time than actual game time. Close to considering handing over the four dollars for this, but the fact that they force me into these ads and all their redundancy makes me back off from purchasing. Perhaps tomorrow if I have the patience. Game seems interesting though."

"9182",1004539546,"Good for new players, fun story mode."
"9183",1004539546,"This game is amazing! I have been playing for over 3 years now and still love it. The developers continue to add new content and fun things to try in the game that keep me interested. The community is great at helping new players learn tips and tricks. Here is the best part, it is NOT a pay to win game! There are many of the top players in the world that have not paid for gems (although it is an option). Each player plays against other players around their level so you will not have to battle against super high level players as you grow. The best part of the game for me is the alliance feature. Gaining friends from around the world and learning tips and tricks from each other is the finest point of this game. Banding together for timed attacks during war against other alliances is exhilarating. The crazy thing is, I play more now than I did when I first started because there are so many little things I can work toward which is amazing because my level is already maxed. You will not regret downloading this game. Find an alliance that is helpful too!"

I did not realize when I bought it that I wouldn’t be able to have both my children play on it with their own progress saved.  Edited to add: just figured out it’s just the iPhone version that doesn’t have the option to switch profiles. The iPad version lets me switch profiles. Upgraded review stars accordingly."

"9198",1005050125,"I have a new iPhone X and the newest IOS (as of Feb 2019). Downloaded DragonBox Numbers and there was no sound.  Ran through some troubleshooting with DragonBox support and the sound issue was fixed.   My 5-year old son really likes the game. I like how the game “talks” about the math going on (IE: “One plus four is five”). I have my son repeat this and it has helped with his basic addition/subtraction. I recommend this game for fun, while educational, learning."
"9199",1005077069,"Awesome war game!!"
"9200",1005077069,"Very fun yet challenging"
"9201",1005077069,"Was looking for a game my son and I could play,saw this,thought awesome,nope,even though my iPad falls into the criteria for this,it loads,then quits,thanks for wasting my time"
"9202",1005098334,"I was able to progress through the levels, but I still felt like I was at a low level the entire time."
"9203",1005098334,"I share the developers' cynicism. We are in a mindless bureaucratic march toward nothing. But if I'm going to waste my life staring at screens, solving meaningless puzzles that have already been solved by someone else and are solvable much more easily by computer programs that have already been built—if I am to be boxed in by machines that quantify my every move—it's at least nice when the pointless puzzles are challenging. So thanks. Maybe I should go outside and play now."
"9204",1005098334,"I made a script which multiplies two inputs, the way the level tells you to. The script gives the correct output, but the manager requests a zero on the last pair, regardless of what said pair is. I am stuck."

"9206",1005322299,"This is a simple game to learn and it is incredibly fun to play. Slightly strange but nonetheless a great way to pass the time."
"9207",1005322299,"Pretty funny. It also doesn't shove the ads And in app transactions in your face."
"9208",1005468883,"Followed the instructions precisely, and the very first time using it the app crashed while analyzing the data in the morning leaving no trace of sleep data. How do I get a refund?"
"9209",1005468883,"Look good but is not working, I was expecting something better but In the last week I’m trying to Use it, but I got not success I hope the developer do something about, the app look good but is not working!"
"9210",1005468883,"I’m going to give it 5 stars, although I’d like to select 4.5, because I can’t use the phone app to edit my start and stop times.  There had been a LOT of time put in this app.  I had used the previous versions on my old Gen1 Apple Watch, and they worked fairly well, but this version on Series 4 is *smooth*!   I only wish there was a function to auto-STOP the tracking if it senses I’m up moving around for a length of time, or al me to edit my start and stop time via the phone app, or at least the stop time.  There are many times that I’ve gotten up and been too tired or distracted to stop the tracker right as I wake, so I may get an extra 30-60 minutes that I can’t edit out.    I’ve run this in conjunction with Sleep ++ and Sleepmatic, and they are decent, but THIS app is the most accurate and allows for modifying the sensitivity (most nights I move a lot when I sleep, so I can change that after the fact and reanalyze the night’s data).  If it ever includes an auto-stop or an post-edit to select a wake time, this will get my full 5 star review."
"9211",1005783927,"Again LOVE THIS GAME"
"9212",1005783927,"Glad you saw the light. When it reached 14 ads before you could play, it was silly. Now..back to normal. Wonder who thought that was a good idea?"

"9216",1005859110,"When I purchased the app, I was not sure what type of reaction I would get working the app into a trick. The first time I used the app (to show a forced card selection) removed any doubt. It was a huge hit.  I think using the app is a great way to ""modernize"" some tried and true traditional card tricks and make them more appealing to a younger audience."
"9217",1006393168,"This is one of the best games I’ve ever played it would be cool if you added a caveman or Neanderthal tribe to the special tribes I can’t wait for this game to come out on pc"
"9218",1006393168,"This is a very, very good game. I’d say it’s almost perfect: the music, diversity of tribes, play style, and strategy allow it to be endlessly entertaining. However, I do wish that they would add one thing: random matchmaking or similar system so that I can queue up a quick game if my friends don’t want to, or for all the people that don’t have friends that play this game. Other than that it is an awesome game and a great download. Most underrated game on the App Store and I hope it gets the credit it deserves."
"9219",1006393168,"Poly topic is such a good game. I’d love to see it have more playable content for the average player the probably won’t spent money of the game. This game has a lot of potential."

"9222",1006408029,"I loved this game before the new up date it was my favorite. But now it’s horrible because of the update. CHANGE IT NOW PLEASE. I’ve waited for a year for you to change it back. But it’s still YL OMG. Everybody agrees with me. Please change it."

"9229",1007115851,"Very fun strategy game . Just wish once you were done with the tutorial you got to experience the then titans without having to grind for them ."
"9230",1007115851,"Your playing an AI... I literally won over 100 games in a row without barely trying..."
"9231",1007115851,"It’s a great game, really competitive, but after a while you begin to realize that there isn’t actually that much to the game.You beat the small campaign at the start and then you play online for the rest of the game. Like I said great game they just need to implement more things into the game. For instance they can add a two vs. two with six tracks instead of three or they can add challenges of some kind and make other ways to gain gold, manna, ranking and etc. Just something to spice it up a little and keep the player immersed. IDK just my thoughts 🤷‍♂️, hope this helps."
"9232",1007120869,"Please developers update this game to be compatible with the newest iPad pro 11inch and 12 one ... its so frustrating having a big screen and not using it ... put in mind including high resolution and 120fps option for this game"
"9233",1007120869,"I like but I want you to add the level maker from the first Badland.May you please add the level maker?Pleaaaseeee? I’ll change my rating to five ⭐️ if you add the level maker."
"9234",1007120869,"Badlands two was an enjoyment to play"

"9238",1007177838,"This is the BEST Solitaire game in the app store period!! This forces you to use strategy and of course it has high replay value!!! No multiplayer....who cares. I enjoy this solo game! No in app purchases AND THE AI DOESN’T CHEAT! There is luck of the draw but it’s 75% skill on the player’s part. Thank you for NOT creating a no win game! I highly recommend this game. There is logic and it makes sense! You guys rock!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"9239",1007177838,"Definitely a fun solo card game and well worth its price. It’s original and engaging. I grabbed the physical card game version too because I enjoyed this game so much."
"9240",1007177838,"My coworker and I love the real card game and the app! We would love to be able to play together on the app. Is this possible?"
"9241",1007479011,"Add more running and swimming events. Add semifinals and finals."
"9242",1007479011,"I think this is the best athletics game but I think it would be better with the following events: 200m, 800m, 4x200m, 4x400m, 400m H, 4x800m, triple jump, and 3000m steeplechase. These events shouldn’t take too long to complete. So in my opinion these events would definitely be a great addition to the game along with possibly other events like championships or/and multiplayer"
"9243",1007479011,"Everything in the game is amazing if you can add feet it would be great"
"9244",1007929736,"Hi, I am unable to sign in with Facebook, and that’s the only place I’ve linked my account. When I open the app and go to sign in, it gives me the four options and I select Facebook and say to continue using that account. After I press “continue”, it goes back to the four options and won’t let me do anything except repeatedly attempt to sign in. The only way to fix this problem is to uninstall and reinstall the app, which is what I had to do yesterday in order to play. This may be an issue caused by the fact that I had previously “offloaded” the app so it would take up less room on my phone, but whatever caused it, it is still an issue. However, despite the occasional small issues (this being the first major one), I absolutely love this game. VOEZ is my favorite music game to date, even above Rhythm Heaven which I’ve been playing for almost ten years. This game definitely deserves five stars, however I can only give it four for now due to the login issue. As soon as it’s fixed, I’ll happily give this game a solid five-star review! Thanks, Rayark, for making such an awesome game!"
"9245",1007929736,"My expectation was on the roof with this game because it’s made by the same Rayark that had never made an unenjoyable game. And OMG!!!! How did this game makes me wanna blow. The gameplay is outstanding, which is a upgraded version of Deemo by adding new mechanics and new efects (it’s nothing hard to learn but takes time and skill to master). The story is actually pretty interesting in it’s own way. But the music is the thing that makes this game an Editor’s Choice for Music Game category. There’re chill, pop, rock, dance and a lot more, and you don’t particularly need to unlock them because the Limited Time system lets you try out every single song in the library. Overall, a new standard for Rhythm Game."
"9246",1007929736,"There is no story that I can find,just still pictures in the diary that I can unlock by playing songs. So where is storyline?"
"9247",1008111072,"Its so so. You can play free but when you start getting higher in leagues you have to wait long periods (days even a week or so) for things to upgrade. Also you can only play 5 battles at a time, than you have to wait for more “ammo”. Lots of waiting in this game. Another BIG problem. In the middle of a battle your troops suddenly stop going where you tell them to. By the time you get them going again they’re dead. Alsoz all to often, you can clear a straight path for them to a target and when you tell them to attack they run around through all the guns instead and of coarse die. Not the best game by any means."
"9248",1008111072,"I like the game and I’d like to play it, but I simply can’t. It is clearly not built for an iPhone XR. Can’t even edit my base, every time I try to drag a building up it swipes out of the app. Also no matter which way I hold the phone, some of the options are off the screen. Again I’d like to play it and it frustrates me that I can’t."
"9249",1008111072,"The view is to wide on the iPhone XS. No way to change the screen size."
"9250",1008234539,"I like it. Not blown away. However now there is a red 2 above it saying I have some kind of notification. Looked more than once can’t find anything. App wont clear it. Signed out and in also. It’s annoying. DELETE TIME."
"9251",1008234539,"Hate that if I don’t log in within 45 days I have to re register"
"9252",1008234539,"App has been having issues logging me in.  Once I log on and accept the terms and conditions it starts telling me I have already enrolled using another account, please log in using that account.  ???  Have no idea what that means.  I’ve used this app for 5 months and in the past month it’s been giving me this message when I try credit wise app"
"9253",1008496061,"This game is super under-rated—it’s great turn-based strategy. If you like Advance Wars, or Warbits, or Fire Emblem, Lost Frontier is totally worth trying out.  The teams are asymmetric too, with some interesting differences between the sides.  I wish the UI was a little clearer about which units were good/bad against which, but that’s relatively minor."
"9254",1008496061,"It’s a game like Advance War on GBA. Recalled my childhood good summer vacation with friends.  One-stop buy a Full-game, without any in-app purchase or ADs.  Awesome graphic and BGM, included story mode and challenge maps.  iCloud save state restore supported! You can play continue your save stage on iPhone or iPad, switch easily. Don’t worry for lost save process even you lost your iPhone.   But, I found few little bugs, e.g. enemy hero’s special power disappeared when I restart the game. Unlimited moves in one round, when I click ”end turn” then exit the app from background. And this game had no updates more than 2 years after last update. Even so, it’s my favorite game on my iPhone.  Looking forward lost frontier 2!"
"9255",1008496061,"Could someone either open-source this or charge me $20 for a DLC expansion (just more maps, minimal effort). There simply isn’t anything else with this classic TBS format & perfect iPhone play. Kills me that it’s just sitting and growing dusty.  My favorite iPhone game so far. I have searched obsessively for a turn based strategy game that incorporated terrain, unit types, capturing & defending space and am really glad I finally found Lost Frontier. It’s perfectly formatted for an iPhone screen, is easy to pick up and has alot of depth and enjoyable challenges in the campaigns. My only regret is that having finished the game twice there is no second version to buy. Well worth the trivial price and a great relief from the litany of “free to play” junk. Saddle up!"
"9256",1008519817,"I have been playing this game for a long time. one of my most enjoyable games until I reached level 1,000.  The game constantly crashes and loose my games.  Can't play at all.  This becomes most frustrating.  Hope you can rectify this problem soon.  Will sure miss playing.  Since this past Wed., I have lost over 50 keys due to the game crashing .  I have been frozen on level 1363 since early this morning and still stuck, I have 14 keys, and want to. Finish this.  A good game but too many malfunctions.  Extremely frustrating.  Too many snags in the game.  Does not give you what it says you should get, and freezes so you don’t get the points you received, and cannot continue to play.  Your game has bee been frozen all day!  AGAIN!!!  9-18-2019. Again, your game is frozen.  How long is this going to go on along w/saying free keys & turns & NOTHING.  Again, the game says free keys, and all day they have to not given me the free keys.  Do you want to lose the people who play this game?"
"9257",1008519817,"I played this game for months without any problems and enjoyed it. Then a month or two ago the ads increased to twice as often,  and then just today all the sudden it popped up an ad that included sexual positions and heavy breathing. Not exactly what I’d call an app appropriate for 4+!!!! Very disappointing. There are plenty of games like this. Pick one of their competitors instead. I’m deleting it."
"9258",1008519817,"I have been sitting at level 1875 for over 3 months. Is this as far as it goes?"
"9259",1008546049,"Great app. This is the best one I've tried, and I've tried several. Plenty of easy to use options. For people who like to use there fingers just to write stuff fast."
"9260",1008546049,"I think its the best app for university students to achieve there goals thank you again 🌷🌹🌺😃😀😜"
"9261",1008546049,"With the new iPad, you can change between the eraser and pencil/pen by tapping on the pen itself, but this app doesn’t have that feature where as other apps do."
"9262",1008692660,"This so far is the best IOS game that I have played. It deserves a much better rating than it currently has. My guess is that too many people have installed this on phones with small screens or older devices with too limited memory. This game plays very well on a newer iPad with sufficient memory. Once you get past the initial learning curve you will find this game to be very fun and addictive."
"9263",1008692660,"I Love This App So Much But There Is No Sci-Fi Themed Food & I Would Like It If You Could Add Something Like Space Kebabs & Alien  Or Something Like That"
"9264",1008692660,"RCT3 needs to be updated because the peeps are laggy but some are cute lol 😂 but I just want to say that if we can have a smooth tool for are coasters Because the coasters are to ruff, but when i went on to play this game the next day i went on sandbox mode and then I went on I got kicked out and I had so many theme parks and I had to delete and download this again but I still liked it!"
"9265",1008719508,"The game itself is fine, but there are repeated ads in a paid game. Even if they're for another game by the same developer I can't support that."

"9267",1008719508,"Totalmente recomendado"

"9269",1009134067,"This game is fun"
"9270",1009134067,"Free gold"
"9271",1009227147,"I mean, come on... let’s be reasonable. This is a fun-ish game. But after a while it gets really boring. I think the creator should update it or something. Like maybe they could make some new maps and characters! But what would be really cool is if they made different vault sticks. Any way, if you are looking for a fun game that never gets boring... I would look for a different game."
"9272",1009227147,"This game is freaking great! Love the innovative controls, retro graphics, and cool landscape. I’d love if you added more maps! And I guess more characters. Also, would be great to have challenges and quests that keep you coming back. The game as it is is fantastic, keep up the great work!"
"9273",1009227147,"This is a fun game but the controls are pretty weird"
"9274",1009257820,"Every time I go to past the url of the page it doesn’t play what url I’m I suppose to copy"
"9275",1009257820,"The re-center didn’t work, but ads did. Purchased but still clunky when trying to center the video. When was this updated last?"
"9276",1009257820,"No point to pay for full version since it doesn’t remove the ads."
"9277",1009336960,"AWESOME GAMES PEPPA MORE OUTFITS PLEASE!!!! Gold star ⭐️ for golden boots! 0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣6️⃣7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣🔟 if possible. Great game, great game,so awesome!!!!! Peppa is so awesome!!! Sophie   Try party 🎈 time, and I love you ❤️💕😘  Entertainment One"
"9278",1009336960,"Just like everyone else said...no sound. Very subpar for a company such as this. Lack of attention to those who paid for quality is unconscionable."
"9279",1009336960,"Don’t buy this, waste of money."
"9280",1009442510,"I got this game expecting to be able to color a group foto with my friends, then i was going to send to print to hang in our lockers. But the quality was absolutely horrifying. Theres just random lines everywhere, somewhat outlining the picture. You have to  pay for many colors, 75% of the drawings, and it costs 10 dollars a week!! If you want to make great pictures like the lady licking the lollipop, find another app. It is just a false add that is not true at all. Oh and now it doesn't let me make my own pictures.  I am very disappointed."
"9281",1009442510,"omg"
"9282",1009442510,"I got this game thinking it was free and as soon as I got in they say they automatically sighed me up for their free trail. They also say I can cancel it any time in settings but I don’t see the subscriptions button so I’m gonna get charged for something I’m not gonna use."
"9283",1009979707,"This game is full of adorable imagination, and I’m sure every person that plays it will quickly fall in love! This game is so fun, and makes you feel like you’ve accomplished so much by taking pictures of the cutest little animals there is on a game! This is...the...best...game...EVER!!🌱💕"
"9284",1009979707,"I love this game"
"9285",1009979707,"So I love this game and I had was so far in the game and I deleted for some reason and really regretted it. I downloaded it again and had to start over. Is there any way I can get back to where I was in the game?"
"9286",1010174792,"I can say something I want and someone may agree with me."
"9287",1010174792,"Very Good Very Good Very Good"
"9288",1010174792,NA
"9289",1010582800,"The game seems decent but has a sharp learning curve and lacks appropriate tutorials."
"9290",1010582800,"This game has one of the smoothest and most action packed rts gameplay on iOS. Bugbyte has created a space rts masterpiece it just needs a sandbox!!!!!!! I would pay upwards to 20+ just to have an update that includes sandbox"
"9291",1010582800,"I only have a few hours in this but I’m already satisfied with my purchase"
"9292",1010587367,"It’s is really good and fun"
"9293",1010587367,"PLEASE MAKE A DODGE BALL one That would be funn!"
"9294",1010587367,"It’s a great game but the ads are annoying"
"9295",1010604522,"The game doesn't have full screen on iPhone 7 Plus, anyone has the same problem?"
"9296",1010604522,"Not one game stopping glitch on my 2017 iPad. Arrows aren’t always visible on the screen so just keep going left or right and they will show up. A wonderful game. So, when is Syberia 3 on iOS coming out? Hurry!"
"9297",1010604522,"After hours of playing the game, there is a glitch that prevents me from getting the heart for the automaton horses. No way to continue the game."

"9301",1010739052,"I love the game but it whole be better if it had the wubbox in it just sayin"
"9302",1010739052,"WOW SO GOOD BUT YOU MAKE ME TRIED"
"9303",1010739052,"I have both MSM games, but I think Dawn of Fire is superior by far. I love the way you have to make actual orders instead of just feeding them, and I love the way they all have their own designated islands. The baby monsters are adorable in every way, and their songs are all so beautiful (Except Flowah, but that’s just my opinion) and come together to make a musical masterpiece. No lie, sometimes I just open the app to listen to the tiny concert. I think my favorite monster is probably the Reedling because of its adorable, dog-like look and beautiful song that kind of reminds me of the bagpipes. It’s a must-buy for anyone who’s into music and cute mythical creatures."
"9304",1010801515,"Every 2 seconds it turns off. Brand new iPad with loads of storage so that is not the issue. This is a scam!!!!!!!"
"9305",1010801515,"Stop making my game stuck as a invisible shark!"
"9306",1010801515,"Make an ultimate griffin sim too!"
"9307",1010801519,"I’m honestly bored of this app. I wish there was more to do..... because pretty much all you do is run around the map I’ve discovered like 10 times and attack everything...."
"9308",1010801519,"Please someone help me with this!"
"9309",1010801519,"The Gluten Free games are the best (only when they do animal sims). It’s defiantly worth the money. This is my favorite  I they made, as I am a very strong lion lover. Anyways, I watch a lot of Nat-Geo Wild, and while I do that, I play the Gluten Free games. If I’m watching a lion, I play Lion Sim. You can hunt, find a pride, and breed and have cute cubs! No ads, great grafics, and a very realistic and accurate simulation of a lion. 🦁🦁🦁 Totally worth the money!"
"9310",1010803520,"4 stars already because it’s not actually complete trash, however graphics could be better, but it is just a mobile game"
"9311",1010803520,"So the game is lots of fun and good for story telling, but there are plenty of bad glitches. The worst is a meteor shower glitch, I was playing and then a meter shower happened I had an egg that was going to hatch in 9:00 minutes. I ran dodging meteors left and right. I made it to my den and my egg would hatch in 8 minutes now. Then the game crashed, which always happens with meteor showers... and then I got on again and guess what! 15:00 minutes till my egg hatches. 😭  The second glitch is that killing prey makes them stretch?  The third glitch is with fish. The fish float in mid air and if you kill one of them they crash your game or they make you fall through the world.  Fourth glitch! If you get a quest from the swamp totem called ‘Aged Skulls’ and accept the dots show up on your map, and if you go to collect the skull there is like a weird barrier thingie and it usually glitches out prey near it.  Finally glitch! Boss fight glitching. I was level 14 or something and went to fight a boss alone. I attacked the boss and ran and attacked and when it was defeated I glitched out and lost all the exp I had gotten in the past few minutes.   Sorry it’s soooo long! Please fix!"
"9312",1010803520,"I love this game it’s very fun but it’s kind of weird When you’re on low Health looks like you have no health and then one more  hit and then you die it’s kind of weird but it’s fun and I still haven’t found out how to change dinosaurs It’s very hard to survive on the meteors get in the game l lm on level 9 And I can’t get to level 10 without dinosaurs killing me"
"9313",1010962391,"I don’t like or play many games, but I do like this one, think it’s fun and sometimes consumes too much of my time.  Please take the last phrase as a big compliment given my tendency to avoid games.  I think the concept for the game fits very well with the explosion of interest in design mainly due to the influence of HGTV and the pioneer design show of the past that have and had competitive spirits as the root of the show.  I also think the player interface and number of elements a player has input ability to go a long way to make this highly interesting and keeps players engaged.  So kudos to all involved in the birth of the ideas for the game, for the execution and delivery of a quality product, and for tweaks and changes as the product. Continues to evolve.  In-app-purchases and absolutely necessary and the business model chosen by most developers today.  I have no issue at all with supporting that business model and prefer it much more than subscriptions.   Another thing you do well is allow free access to every element in the game, which is not common.  Also, with judicious decisions and the ability to earn them for free, a player can go a long way in this game without spending a penny.  So along with the kudos, I’d like to pass along some aspects of the game that in my own opinion, should be considered important to future updates.     First, I’ve not found a way to change my identity in the game from USER XXXXXXXXXX to a name of my choosing and basically create a profile other than by logging in through a Facebook account.  I refuse to join Facebook and because I do, I’m prevented from establishing an identity in the game.  I hope there is another way I have missed to login, because if there isn’t  I won’t continue to use the game.  I refuse to have to bow to Facebook to use a piece of software and would like a reply from the developer about this.  In my opinion, the weakest part and it’s very weak, is the voting. How in the world can a design achieve a 5.0 when the designer uses the same piece of wall art multiple times in a room?  If my designer did that, I’d fire her/him in a second.  Another thing that gets overlooked in voting, is the hodgepodge of finishes (e.g. dark wood, silver, gold, bronze, light wood, etc.) for things like cocktail table, end table, sofa, chair and ottoman legs that again I’d fire my designer for putting in my house that frequent in rooms that  receive a 5.0 score.  Finally, 5.0 scores are common for designs that are totally inconsistent with the design instructions that are given and I’m sure frustrate players as I’ve seen reviews citing that issue.  I don’t have an answer to this other than dropping the vote altogether, but feel it is such a weak part of the game that serious noodling should be done.  Finally, I have had a problem receiving “free diamonds” that were earned by making a hotel reservation and staying at the hotel through one of your sponsors who is no longer in your list.  I’m not sure how to rectify this since the sponsor is no longer in your list.  I hope my comments are helpful."
"9314",1010962391,"First, I really enjoy the actual design aspect of the game.  Unfortunately, when scoring the designs, very little, if any consideration is given to the original intent of the design, instead, having voting more of a popularity contest than a true design assignment. This seems to be a complaint across the other reviews for this app I have read. Second, and probably the most frustrating part of entering the room design contests, is purchasing furniture, finishing the room and having the corresponding monies deducted from my account....And then, an error occurs and it deletes my room design, forcing me to start over from scratch. This wouldn’t be so horrible if it also put the money spent on furniture during that particular room design back into my account...it doesn’t and you end up losing your money.. They also could use a better way of reviewing and sorting your inventory...a good “sort” feature. Which brings me to my third and biggest complaint;  the lack of response from customer service.  Currently, I have an open e-mail from June 11th, 12 days without any response.  I also make sure I update that email, advising them it remains without response.  I have probably spent over $250, much of which was lost during the frequent technical issues that force a reboot mid-game. It is now mid-September and I am still having the same, unanswered issue. They have closed and deleted the correspondence so I am not able to view or print it.  I have made many requests for hard copy print outs to share with my bank to fight the inaccurate charges. The last correspondence took weeks before I received a reply from a “person”.  I was the asked to confirm some information...unfortunately, when I wasn’t able to respond within 48 hours, they closed they email and deleted it from view so I was no longer able to reference the issue for my bank. They need to have a better response system, more timely responses, and to provide their customers, me, with a copy of my purchase history alongside the reboot history so I can compare this and obtain a refund of the incorrectly billed funds. Four months is ridiculous. I’ve since requested all the back copies of my correspondence...they delete them from your sight when they determine to close them, even when, like me, the issue is never resolved. It’s really too bad these problems are becoming more of an issue...I am looking for a different room design app to replace this."
"9315",1010962391,"The game is great, until you rack up inventory that you bought and it disappears, that should be fixed, I deliberately bought an item 3 times and it kept deleting."
"9316",1010999283,"Hey. This game is awesome, and I recommend it. But I came here to say something else.     I’m very proud of Gluten Free Games. If you take a look at Wild Horse Simulator, made by Gluten Free Games, then at this game, there’s major improvement. I’ve had Wild Horse Simulator for years. I’d love to say that if one of the creators are reading this, that I’ll always be around to play your games and support you. Thank you so much for all your games, it truly means a lot."
"9317",1010999283,"this game is OK the controls are OK I can this company make an Ultimate Pokémon simulator? if you do then I’ll be happy😊"
"9318",1010999283,"Idk how to breed do you and your mate need to be at the same level?.idk tell me.anyway I like playing this game right now because my cat is missing I miss her I’ve said to much ok now anyway it would mean a lot if you would tell me how to breed"
"9319",1011000146,"The Ultimate Dragon Simulator, is awesome! Although some more elements would make it even better. Plus I think that you should make it that dragons can have more then one element. Like a fire dragon can also be storm and use storm attacks. And you should maybe make a water element and a nature element. But while I love this game, Gluten Free Games, have another game idea and if you already saw my old review about the ""Ultimate Desert Simulator"", you can forget it (optional) because I have a brand new idea: the ""Ultimate Fantasy Simulator."" So in the beginning you start out as a dragon with the wyvern also already unlocked. Then at level 5 you unlock the rock golem. And at level 10 you unlock the orc. And at level 15 you unlock the fairy. And at level 20 you unlock the unicorn. And at level 25 you unlock the gryphon. And at level 30 you unlock the cerberus. And at level 35 you unlock the treent. And finally at level 40 you unlock the phoenix. And the different areas should be the lava land, the arctic, the sky islands, and the forest which should be in the same area that the humans live in. And the Aggressive Creatures should be: Dragons, Wyverns, Rock Golems, Orcs, Gryphons, Cerberuses,  Phoenixes, Wolves, Killer Mushrooms, Sea Serpents, Bears, Ice Creatures (monsters made of ice and bone), and Lava Creatures (monsters made of lava and bone). And Passive Creatures should be: Fairies, Unicorns, Treents, Sheep, Goats, Deer, Flying Pigs (pigs with white wings), Frog People (small frogs that walk on there hind legs and ware clothes like little people), Fish, Mermaids, and Villagers. And if you add warriors like knights, archers, etc. is it possible to make them act aggressively towards aggressive creatures like dragons but not passive creatures like fairies? If so, that would be great. And maybe you could give some of the playable animals powers like for example the dragon could breathe fire or the gryphon could create tornadoes that damage its enemies. And the dragon should eat ONLY Meat. The wyvern should eat ONLY Meat. The rock golem should eat Rocks ONLY. The orc should eat ONLY Meat. The fairy should eat ONLY Plants. The unicorn should eat ONLY Plants. The griffin should eat ONLY Meat. The cerberus should eat ONLY Meat. The treent should eat ONLY Plants. And the phoenix should eat ONLY Meat. So pleeeeeeeeese consider my idea!"
"9320",1011000146,"First this game is awesome I love it but whenever I go into my den I can’t see anything it’s gray and black and glitch and I can’t take my baby dragon out of the den without seeing so I NEED you to FIX these glitches my brother has the game and his dens are fine mine are glitched I NEED this to get FIXED this is why I give it 3 stars because of the glitches and I HATE games that have glitches in them they annoy me SO much"
"9321",1011000146,"The Fire Ice and Storm elements are nice and all, but add some new ones, like Dark and Nature. You should be able to create your own fire, if you don’t want a element.   Please take my review into account.  (Edit) Hi I have noticed that my review has not been read. I LOVE this game, but it’s getting.... boring with only 3 elements! PLEASE make more elements! It would be so fun with new attacks! Again, please take my review into account. Oh and my Storm dragon, Stardust, is level 96 not kidding it awesome and it has the Celestial ranking!  (Edit) Hi!! I’m super exited because my Stardust is level 100 now! Yay! So so so sorry for asking again, but more elements!"
"9322",1011132019,"Too hard"
"9323",1011132019,"Every Roli app has a major problem, rendering it useless - which is really sad because the hardware is awesome.  This particular app has a distorted sound that makes it impossible to navigate, very frustrating."
"9324",1011132019,"I do NOT want an account and I do NOT want to “register” my device I want to USE THE DEVICE I PAID FOR!!!  Yet I am FORCED to do both with this crappy app.    Screw you and your pushy dark patterns, sorry I paid money for this horrible experience."
"9325",1011193872,"Reely gud gaam is fun."
"9326",1011193872,"A couple of things, This game is really good and has a lot of potential but there are some bugs that are really annoying and can make a player be really annoyed. First thing when you tap around a monster the monster changes directions and can ruin your score especially if your trying to get a flawless every time. Another thing is when I clicked on the monster icon to watch a video for my ""coins"" It just loaded the entire time leading me to restart my game. Also when I got to planet 3 level 1 I got passed that level but it kept on resend It kept on resenting me back. Lastly like I stated before I like to get 3 stars so when I don't I like to retry but there's no retry button so I have to go to home and find my level I was on just to retry it or I have to do the entire level to retry it again which is quite annoying."
"9327",1011193872,"This game is very bad it is fun at the beginning but gets very hard very fast until it's almost impossible to beat."
"9328",1011396240,"Works just fine turns switches on and off when connected to the same network.  My only issue is I created groups with Wemo light bulbs.  I had issues with this at first some being me not knowing exactly what I was doing, but finally was able to create a group and it works just fine.  The issue is creating the previous groups until I got it right, the previous groups still show up even though they aren’t used and I see no way to delete them."

Just a fun app. The only problem is that there are adds, but I don’t really care because there aren’t that many. I highly recommend it to people that like playing would you rather."
"9348",1011788068,"I love this app, I’ve had it for years but it can be buggy at times. It crashes or doesn’t load. This doesn’t happen very often and when it happens the Developers fix it right away, however it still is annoying when it does happen and you can’t play for a few hours. Other than that, this is a great game. I love trying to climb the leaderboard and getting all the achievements done to make my profile look better. The community is decently active. Would recommend.  EDIT: I’m giving this 5 stars now because it does not crash as often and is the only active WYR app on the AppStore that I’m aware of. It still can be buggy at times, but like I said the Developers fix it the first moment they can."

"9352",1011915604,"I could never get in to vote. App wouldn’t load! Paid 2 months for NOTHING!"
"9353",1011915604,"One of the best Apps going!!! I love it and especially the content!!!  So thankful that Kodi Lee won!!! God saved Kodi Lee to give this special talent to him. God bless you Kodi. I pray for only the best for you from this point on. 💕🙏🏼✝️"
"9354",1011915604,"Awesome. Season. Best. Final ever.   My pick won. Congratulations.  Cody. Lee. Amazing job. And a truly talented young man."
"9355",1011935076,"I love Digit so much. It helps with saving up for things that I need and I don’t have to worry about setting money aside manually. The only thing I wish was added was the ability to use more than one bank account. Even if it’s limited to two. That’d be pretty nice."
"9356",1011935076,"After experiencing a mishap with this app I was contacted immediately with immediate results. I am hoping for positive experience going forward with the advancement of this savings tool.  Happy saving!"
"9357",1011935076,"This app saved over $900 for me but I changed my bank account since using the app & now it won’t let me change the bank account on the app & I have no access to MY MONEY. I highly do not recommend using this app. Their “help center” is useless & I cannot get in contact with anyone to solve my issue."
"9358",1011983738,"When I open this app which I have been using for over a year it does not always work. And I have to turn it off and on over and over again before it works. This has been the best tuner I’ve downloaded but if this doesn’t get fixed I may need to move on.."
"9359",1011983738,"It was great until the mic stopped responding. Maybe that will somehow fix itself. I tried force quitting it, but to no avail."
"9360",1011983738,"For no apparent reason, about half the time when I start the app, the tuner just doesn’t work at all. I haven’t changed the settings. I’ve tried restarting with no improvement. Not much point in a tuner app if the tuner doesn’t work."
"9361",1011987577,"The first 50 levels are easy enough to complete in as many minutes. The challenge comes after level 55 or so, which makes me think it’s not worth it."
"9362",1011987577,"When I only have a few minutes, this is a nice way to pass the time."
"9363",1011987577,"Thank you, Shelley Alon!! Its rare to find a game that doesn't become boring after the first couple of times playing it. That this app only has 200 reviews is unfortunate. It seems so many talented developers don't get due credit for their creativity and effort not to mention their generosity. The App store sure doesn't  help get the word out. Anyway, the game is Ads free and free of charge, so rare. all this to say that this game is a lot of fun and I recommend it to anybody and everybody! :)"
"9364",1012032539,"I deleted this app weeks ago, didn’t do what I needed, and out of no where for the past few days I’ve been getting incoming calls saying sideline!!! I don’t even know how to make them stop"
"9365",1012032539,"With every app update sideline has more bugs and issues that arise. Sideline app constantly freezes and can’t send messages longer than 2 lines. This app has more issues than the TextNow app and that’s actually free."
"9366",1012032539,"I don't like how I can't see what number or contact is popping up for any sideline call. I have to wait until the the suspected spam call has been declined to see who it really is.  I also don't like that there is a delay in texts when I am receiving long texts so the order is mixed up. I can't use this number to confirm security/bank issues.  I had to upgrade to the $59 dollar plan - was the cheaper alternative but not any more. There are other cheaper options. It is cheaper than a true phone line but it could be improved."
"9367",1012151919,"I have to buy strawberries for Charlotte at her stand to make strawberry shortcake and progress in the game but every time i click on the building it take me to Michelle’s luxury products. Charlottes stand doesn’t exist or at least it didn’t process that i bought her stand. But beside that i enjoy the game so far."
"9368",1012151919,"Why they haven’t updated??? Was going to download but not anymore"
"9369",1012151919,"Honestly, LOVE this game. But I’ve had it on this device for maybe a year and a half, and recently it’s been crashing about every 5 to 10 minutes. I REALLY love this game, but it is really frustrating. Hopefully this will be fixed soon, and I will continue to play this game, but really really would PLEASE like this fixed. P.S.- Needs a MAJOR glow up."
"9370",1012231677,"So Long"
"9371",1012231677,"It is so awesome it should not exist 😍😍😍👍👍👍😂😂😂😂😇😇😇😇❤️👌❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰😋😗🤑🤑🤑😺😻😺😸😹😽💪👍👍👍👍👍"
"9372",1012231677,"I love the game its just the online and rank glitch whenever someone dies their death sound repeat fix that pls"
"9373",1012274888,"Makes an amateur look good.  I've surprised myself a few times. After a while the brush strokes take on a life (style) of their  own."
"9374",1012274888,"This is my favorite drawing app. Its simplicity is its strength. Easy to use with the ability to save incrementally. I use the Apple Pencil. When I finish a drawing I email it to myself and save in a file before posting on Pinterest. My only problem is that I have hit the delete button by mistake and there goes the drawing! No recovery. If I could have one thing different it would be the placement of the delete somewhere else so no accidental deletes!"
"9375",1012274888,"Please add layers, otherwise it’s a wonderful app. Very fun too."
"9376",1012298403,"Really good game. I don’t have any complaints except sometimes, when trying to place a fire, it doesn’t work, causing me to die from darkness. If that was fixed, the game would be nearly perfect."
"9377",1012298403,"It’s great"
"9378",1012298403,"It glitches, freezes in don’t starve original and I can’t even craft stuff properly in shipwrecked. Got an upgrade from a iPhone 7 Plus to a XR and can’t play either games without issues every 5-10 minutes"
"9379",1012368051,"Fun"
"9380",1012368051,"好"
"9381",1012368051,"So far so good"
"9382",1012604262,"I love this game it’s so much fun to play when I’m bored"
"9383",1012604262,"-turn"
"9384",1012604262,"Cool"
"9385",1012712705,"Amazing Game! It’s one of those addicting games when you make a village and its kinda like clash of clans or boom beach.the only downside is that when you need more gems it has a time limit for getting them and when you tap on it it won’t work. But overall it’s pretty good!"
"9386",1012712705,"There are a lot of choices in how to develop and deploy your fleet, and island features. You can maneuver individual ships in battle. You get to pick where your workers spend their time. This makes the game a lot of fun.   If there weren’t some glitches in the UI displaying build times, and assigning workers, I’d give it 5 stars instead of 4."
"9387",1012712705,"This game has fury little animals in sea boats. THIS IS A Awesome APP."
"9388",1012867463,"今天10月18更新的最新版本安装后闪退，关机重启卸载再安装依旧闪退，开发团队不测试就上架吗？打客服电话95188让我稍后再安装试试，我真服这款APP了。"
"9389",1012867463,"什么时候出touch ID啊 都三周年了。"
"9390",1012867463,"RT"
"9391",1013551921,"The video comes out nice quality, and tons of editing features. The only thing is the watermark in the corner but that's just the free version. So yea 10/10"
"9392",1013551921,NA
"9393",1013551921,NA
"9394",1013585593,"Boring and not fun I don’t like anything about and cant understand ho would."
"9395",1013585593,"Cool and masterful. Makes you feel like a creator"
"9396",1013585593,"After going through the triangle, square, and pentagon I fully expected a hexagon. When it didn’t materialize, and the game was over, I have to admit getting a bit annoyed. There really isn’t any enjoyment in repeating the puzzles so would have loved a few more puzzles. It would have made more sense to stop at the octagon heheh. In the end it was fun while it lasted."
"9397",1013780477,"Ok Finally you make the game better it's Easier"
"9398",1013780477,"This game has nothing unlocked!! Every thing is money and it takes seven hours to play again!!😡😡👿 I had my phone download it and it took eight hours just to load and to play! I would never ever download this game!! I’m deleting it!👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
"9399",1013780477,"You can’t even go past the sixth level without buying things!! I had perfect scores on all of the levels (1-6) with the default moves and at level six you can’t even get one star, so basically you have to pay for all the levels after six. This game was fun for two minutes and then I would have to pay! I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone unless they like having a game that is unable of being completed. 😡"
"9400",1013992870,"Hard to earn $$$ when the ads keep freezing 😞"
"9401",1013992870,"I haven’t played long but I literally can’t when the game crashes every few minutes. I’ve had to close the game and open it back up more than a few times within an hour or so. Not only that but crafting and building times including activities to get the resources needed take hours which isn’t really ideal especially for the “kids” this game is marketed toward or anyone for that matter."
"9402",1013992870,"Two weeks later: Did not invest my own money but it was happy to take away my dollar bills.  Also when you put in any gates, flower, or bushes, they are never in their original location. It crashed a couple of times then the roads and buildings didn’t even display.  I decided to delete at level 50.  One month later: am I the only one? Dollar bills go missing. I had just purchased a package so there were a few hundred bills. The second time I made a note and contacted support but no response.    I no longer will invest any money in this game.  Other games have options if want to purchase but this makes mandatory. I had never had spend such money on a game.   1. if I choose to skip by viewing the video, it will either crash on specific ads or won’t skip the time (usually Lily’s Garden)  2. it says it doesn’t require an internet connection but when it crashes it often gives “unable to connect to internet” and Woodstock appears.  3. it’s an interesting game but it slows down the game after the space town update.  4. If I joined late, how can I get access to some of the characters?"
"9403",1014277964,"I love the app but that watermark gets in the way... Please move it..."
"9404",1014277964,"I used to love using the app. This used to be my go-to app but with the new update and stuff is just ......... I’ve used this for years and i just can’t get used to the new update and don’t really like it anymore. There used to be so many cool things on it as well."
"9405",1014277964,"The pics come out grainy and unfocused now. Especially night pics! What gives? Please make them soft again. why do they always update and ruin these apps 😴"
"9406",1014459049,"Súper bueno"
"9407",1014459049,"It won’t open at all."
"9408",1014459049,"The app won’t open for the iPhone X or beyond IOS 11.  Support responds to email with a repeat of your question; no resolution.  So disappointing!  I gave one star because a rating is required to post a review.   There should be guidelines of how long an app will be supported  for operating systems, timeline for fixes and refund options.  Too many apps are abandoned that result in lost funds to the buyer."
"9409",1014565551,"i love sago mini. i was dissappointed though. i love there games but in this game you make houses witch its very creative. but riyliey just turned 6 and she says its boring. i loved it like her but then she said get the secret button (update) its too hard for kids to get three fingers on there. she now has scraches."
"9410",1014565551,"My 7 year old didn't like this game."
"9411",1014565551,"Hi, my son is a huge fan of all the sago mini games, and we haven't had an issue until now. I installed the most recent update giving access to build the new houses, and now when the vehicle gets to the end of each ""board"" it just shuts the game off. Completely. As if he hit the home button. It's doing this on the new houses as well as the old. He is super frustrated and crying (only 4, highly emotional). I would give you 5 stars and more on everything you put out...but can you look into this?"
"9412",1014902505,"I like how it shows you your target time while you are playing"
"9413",1014902505,"This game is so so amazing! I don’t even know what to say!"
"9414",1014902505,"Too"
"9415",1014919815,"Both son and myself play just need way to get jewels easier"
"9416",1014919815,"I love this game so much and play it every day. Sometimes the stages are super hard and I’m having a lot of trouble getting past the Snorlax stage, but it’s ok. Still a very fun game!"
"9417",1014919815,"I just wish they would reload hearts more faster But amazing I would recommend it for anyone"
"9418",1014920360,"Comparable to This War of Mine and N.E.O. Scavenger.  This game has a high difficulty level. You may enjoy playing it if you like repetition and strategy.  Drawbacks: resources and crafting are very tightly balanced and you’ll die quickly if you don’t manage everything precisely. There is very little online support in English and most reviews only reach the 30-day mark."
"9419",1014920360,"You have to buy the game. Then after that, of you want a dog, different people, better skills, you have to pay for it. So even though you ALREADY PAID for the game, you have to pay to play even more. Just go play This War of Mine. This is a knock off for it anyways. At least with them it's not pay to play."
"9420",1014920360,"It’s a great game but when you die over and over it get a little repetitive"
"9421",1015000630,"Very fun scenarios, each a different idea."
"9422",1015000630,"Only two of ten missions are included.  You have to pay to unlock the others.  For an aging game concept this misleading value is irritating.  ""May include in app purchases to access what you just purchased?!?""   Sorry, I'll pass on future products from this company."
"9423",1015000630,"I wish it had a sandbox mode so I could try different units against each other. ☃️"
"9424",1015059175,"Love it!"
"9425",1015059175,"Only had it a few days but I’m definitely upgrading the packs. This app does EVERYTHING"
"9426",1015059175,"So easy to use!"
"9427",1015225810,"给一星都嫌多了"
"9428",1015225810,"新的版本的各个频道的图标重新设计了，挺好看。但是改版后很多频道变成列表设计导致离线下载无法查看。而且设置里面的离线下载按钮被隐藏，需要使用3d touch在主图标上面进行离线下载。这不是个好兆头，感觉zaker在慢慢边缘化离线下载功能。希望这个功能不会被取消，因为美国很多地铁没有信号，这几年就靠离线功能度过地铁上的时光。"
"9429",1015225810,"什么状况？"
"9430",1015552271,"I paid for this app and it doesn’t have any sound. I restarted, deleted and re-added and nothing helps. I downloaded the “package” of paw patrol games and the others seem to work."
"9431",1015552271,"Every time my daughter tries to play this it glitches off. I want my money back."
"9432",1015552271,"I can not get the app to download."
"9433",1015603795,"Downloaded it twice, crashed my iPad twice. Waste of money!"
"9434",1015603795,"This is a fun game and my son used to enjoy it but I played with him trying to see why he has lost interest and noticed that the characters talk over each other frequently so you can't always understand them and instructions aren't clear. Also, we just played the dinosaur dig 3 times to get the achievement and tried to uncover all the items and the dirt never disappears completely so we never get the achievement so the other levels don't get unlocked. No wonder he gets bored with it and doesn't want to play this app anymore. Please fix."
"9435",1015603795,"This game worked for a few days with sound, now there is no sound at all! Would definitely like my money back! All the other games I have purchased from the iTunes Store work perfectly fine with sound except this one. Very disappointed! I'm glad I did not purchase the bundle!"
"9436",1015944446,"And I’m 68 years old. HaHa."
"9437",1015944446,"Excellent job! The drawings are gorgeous. I really love playing this train traffic controller. The best I’ve played since Mini Metro. Great job and I hope the is a follow up with different drawings and a new theme. A must buy puzzler."
"9438",1015944446,"There’s videos interspersed between levels and at the end when you finish the game.  I imagine they’re nice but every single video crashes the app. Literally every single one of them."
"9439",1016279124,"Nice game!"
"9440",1016279124,"Lag"
"9441",1016279124,"Great game and a lot of fun...it doesn't require much time, quick fun."
"9442",1016360869,"It’s OK but I think you should unlock  all the things and have no time limit on the wedding ceremony I think that you should be able to customize the groom."
"9443",1016360869,"Every time I would finish choosing a dress or a face type, I would click the done button and immediately be transported to an ad. While the ad was playing, apple would ask if I would like to purchase the spa for 7 dollars. Despite declining, it would still bring me to the spa, and once I went back to the home page all my progress would be lost."
"9444",1016360869,"I read all the other reviews and downloaded this game after I did the show time part of the wedding ceremony it just locked on me.Like what the hay bales coco FIX THIS! >:("
"9445",1016366447,"This is, no exaggeration, the most intuitive text apps that I have ever used. No complaints at all with the free version but I will definitely be upgrading to pro for the sync features."
"9446",1016366447,"I have been looking for a good simple note taking app along with a multi-tasking section such as todo and calendar etc. and I came across Bear. Honestly the simplicity of the app and navigation is what got me, along with their amazing themes which i am currently using the Cobalt theme. I have been using the nest-tagging system and the Note Linking to the max and pretty much addicted lol.   It would be great to include different font color options. This would be a great addition when you want to really get in depth with organizing and highlighting. Now this would be potentially cause an issue with Markdown compatibility but if you are able to get around that it would be an added bonus."
"9447",1016366447,"It's very good,  I would recommend anyone to use it!"
"9448",1016673544,"I loved your products!! ❣️😘🤗"
"9449",1016673544,"the makeup is amazing and i love the prices!!"
"9450",1016673544,"None of the products I got were from the brands I selected in the survey!  I signed up for the glamorous bag plus program and got my first month’s bag. I tried all the products and the quality is really not what I expected! Both of the 2 eyeshadows and the powder look really really cheap. The red flag is already there when I saw the poor package of the products — there are some gaps in the eyeshadow plate edges. The quality is obviously much lower than the brands I selected on the survey. So I terminated my subscription. However I don’t know what to do with the first month’s products. I considered giving them away to my friends but honestly I don’t think anyone would want to take them even for free! I feel scammed because of the survey! I would probably never consider this app if I knew the products are not gonna be from the brands I trusted."
"9451",1016686482,"Effective cAnd hwas"
"9452",1016686482,"I have tried many times and this app will not download on my phone or iPad."
"9453",1016686482,"The app is awesome and we love the interaction. Really well done!  However, we are not a fan of the new narrator. The previous narrator was much more engaging and entertaining. We’ll hold off on updating the other Dr. Seuss story apps to avoid the unfortunate surprise of a new narrator."
"9454",1016810652,"My 3yr old and I have fun playing this together.  She's excited about earning stars. Sometimes we don't get a star even though our expression looks exact. Oh well, we just try for it the next time. 😝"
"9455",1016810652,"We loved this app, and the very cute laughter, but now there is no sound. I have deleted, and redownloaded, but still, there is no sound. I hope you'll  fix this problem."
"9456",1016810652,"Sadly the app doesn't work. Like many others it closes when a character is selected."
"9457",1016915419,"Needs an update or something.  Game won’t start anymore on my iPhone.   Completed all the levels but I still enjoy replaying them.  Can’t do that anymore.  Game just crashes on startup.   Please fix and add more levels."
"9458",1016915419,"Good puzzle game. I finished all the levels including amazing in a few days, probably six hours. I liked it. Good for the price."
"9459",1016915419,"Brilliantly conceived and well executed."
"9460",1017064541,"I love this game!  My favorite by far !"
"9461",1017064541,"It’s like playing in Vegas. I enjoy playing the different slots machines."
"9462",1017064541,"Very good game"
"9463",1017112774,"Everything in technology is unusable thanks to adverts"
"9464",1017112774,"This is a fun game until the first ad pops up and you lose all game sounds. Sound for ads work but you lose game sounds until you quit and restart app. So you are restarting app more than you are actually playing it due to this problem!"
"9465",1017112774,"Boring game play that gets old fast. Ads interrupt constantly and ruin flow of game. Buggy and randomly crashes."
"9466",1017148055,"Great app to have if you’re planning on settling down and saving up for retirement"
"9467",1017148055,"I used to love this app! Now it’s meh. I’m already looking into less annoying alternatives. Why is it so easy to accidentally set up auto stash after a transaction? I don’t want it, so, stop asking me. Why do you constantly prompt me to tell my friends? The ones that wanted it already have it. I don’t care about your debit card. Just let me make a purchase without having to jump through hoops or constantly being solicited."
"9468",1017148055,"Good way to save and invest. I forget that I am putting money there. Great app"
"9469",1017186083,"I love this game however some parts of the game are in Chinese!!! Wish it would be translated to English so I know what to do!"
"9470",1017186083,"Very cool game and has its own soul"
"9471",1017186083,"Pretty cool game man"
"9472",1017367213,"So cringeworthy and funny....but it could....use the workshop like on the PC version"
"9473",1017367213,"Okay so I saw a review and it said put an anti virus on the app and DUDE I freaking love this game and don’t believe the review I saw because I DONT WANT THAT STUPID VIRUS."
"9474",1017367213,"I finally finished the game really fun plz make 2 It’s sad I finished the game I wish there’s more to it"
"9475",1017447032,"This app freezes up and doesn’t save your spot. It is a complete rip off."
"9476",1017447032,"App freezes up. App was overpriced for not working. Developer makes you jump through hoops to contact and won’t reply"
"9477",1017447032,"Don't buy this game It keeps freezing and wasting money"
"9478",1017492454,"i got this app because i wanted to play what i wanted and not have to be in the app for it to keep playing my music. then when they updated it, i couldn't play music after leaving the app, it would cut off. it’s literally another youtube"
"9479",1017492454,"I’m satisfied with YouTube Red , just the price is outrageousness better off with ITunes !  Not everyone has the money nor card to purchases the membership... come on now"
"9480",1017492454,"Literally freezes every 10th command. Only thing good youtube music subscription is no ads on YouTube..."
"9481",1017551780,"I love this game, but now it won’t load. I’ve tried restarting my phone, but that didn’t work. I don’t want to delete the app & reinstall because I’m on level 260 something and I’m afraid I’ll lose all of my progress."
"9482",1017551780,"I love this game. Collecting all the emojis and the being able to use the in text messages to my friends is great! Everyone is always asking how to get them too. The games are easy and fast so you can play even when u only have five minutes or so. I love this game!"
"9483",1017551780,"Emoji blitz is relaxing and will keep ur mind busy"
"9484",1017627073,"It nice and fun, but combos aren’t detected very often. Although the bubbles are lit up, they pop one at a time and fill the tank quickly. My daughter has tried so many times to get the third fish on a level, but it seems about impossible... especially on the first level!!!"
"9485",1017627073,"Perhaps matching numbers to what is showing on the screen for younger kids. Current games are confusing."
"9486",1017627073,"This is a great game to learn numbers but I wish it verbally said the number."
"9487",1018002876,"I've been a huge fan of Orange Pixel since Meganoid hit the AppStore years back, so my review is probably going to be pretty bias (just laying it out there, also of note, I've become a pretty big TBS and Roguelike fan over the last couple years). But, this is definitely up there among the best games that they have put out. I don't know if Heroes of Loot or this, Space Grunts, is my #1 favorite OP game, but they both give up an amazingly spectacular run for it. The controls might take some getting use to, as they're virtual, but resizing is coming in an update and ATM you can place every button wherever you'd like on the screen. Once I played about 3 games, they were perfect. I couldn't imagine playing it any other way. The mix of action and turn-based gameplay is done incredibly well. I really just can not stop gushing about every aspect of the game. The menus are well done, the UI layout/map setup is on point, the graphics are killer (though they may not look it in the AppStore screens, the game looks GREAT in motion - check out some HQ vids!), the roguelike aspect is done perfectly---It's a great game. One that has already (VERY VERY quickly) earned it's spot on my own GOTY list (#2 of 2 ATM [Feb]) - but I wholeheartedly recommend this to roguelike fans itching for the genre to take a turn towards more arcade-based gameplay. =oD  **update**  The new update rocks... thank you for the resizing controls option, the new item and giving each character a level upgrade once they beat the game (having something that sticks with you after making it through that was a great decision...) - and the tweaks. This has very quickly become, not only one of my favorite games of the year, but also one of my favorite roguelikes ever. GET IT!!!!"
"9488",1018002876,"I've had this game for a few years. High scores have never connected.    Gameplay in itself is alright.  The current price of 3.99 is kind of steep for what your getting.   The game offers decent combat but very little depth.   This is one of those play for 5 minutes to see how far you can progress, die, and restart.    There are three characters, but nothing to really work for and nothing to unlock."
"9489",1018002876,"It's a good little game. Controls are a little funky at times, but otherwise you're given what they show. Certainly worth more than 1.99."
"9490",1018215577,"I love it sooo much it’s like reality. So basically it’s about foxes cause it’s a fox game.🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊"
"9491",1018215577,"This was the best game I ever played.i think you that this game I just can’t say cause this game is just to amazing 😉 people really need to learn what it is in the Fox world"
"9492",1018215577,"This is the beeeest fox game ever but it keeps logging me out please fix that"
"9493",1018216485,"Ouvrage formidable et super utile. Je le trouve très complet. J’ai été agréablement surpris d’y trouver même des noms propres. Malheureusement une petite lacune: à la différence des mots communs, il manque la transcription phonétique aux noms propres."
"9494",1018216485,"It is nearly identical to the ""Robert for iPad"" app that this developer was selling 3 years ago and dropped just to be able to charge $8.99 for a ""new"" app.  Nearly identical, but in fact slightly inferior:  The ""Robert for iPad"" contained some graphics. For example, the entry for a country would provide the country's flag and a couple of maps.  This ""new, improved"" app got rid of this kind of material.  I really regret purchasing it since, by the time I actually move on to iOS 11, the developer will probably have come up with a new app replacing this one, a new app with even less content, needless to say."
"9495",1018216485,"I am learning French by reading French ebooks, among other things.    I literally cannot imagine how much more difficult it would be to learn French without this app.    It is much more convenient than a regular dictionary because you can cut a word from the ebook/article/whatever, then paste it into the search bar of the app.  That is MUCH faster than using a paper dictionary.    The word is almost always in the dictionary -- with French definitions, usage, verb conjugations, special usages, ..  You can look up a verb from any of its forms.  I.e., you do not need to know the infinitive.  There are a few small gaps, but overall this really sets the standard for a well-designed dictionary app.  I only wish I could find similar apps for other languages.  A VERY good value."
"9496",1018236462,"Has awesome clothes, especially for plus size women. The app is just really slow and closes itself while you’re on it.."
"9497",1018236462,"First time using the app and it’s so much easier than the browser! Not app related, but I always use express shipping and they always meet the expected delivery date! Currently waiting on a order to be delivered today 🥰 Thanks Boohoo 💕"
"9498",1018236462,"The app does not match the website. It’s hard finding certain items on the app that are easily found on the site. Also the advertisements never match which is also annoying."
"9499",1018355599,"I’m out on the farm a lot, at the very edge of cell coverage. Twitter’s native app is so crufted up with surveillance gear that it can’t load content.  Tweetbot works fine. I wish it was easier to block and mute, though."
"9500",1018355599,"The best Twitter app bar none"
"9501",1018355599,"Tap the messages icon and it brings it current. No scrolling FOREVER. Easier access to your profile page. One click style. Otherwise not bad."
"9502",1018356776,"Was fun to play at first...now every time I go in to play it closes back out"
"9503",1018356776,NA
"9504",1018356776,NA
"9505",1018357323,"So I play the game and then it gets stuck. I cannot do anything. So I say ok lets restart it and start again form the beginning. (After playing it for two in a half days)! Then I get farther and everytime the guy hands me the orb the whole game shuts down completely! Wth!!  Ugh!!!"
"9506",1018357323,"I've been a huge fan of BFG for a VERY long time now, but as of late, they are a totally different company, and one I really don't like. First, they don't give you the first chapter free anymore (if they had, I would have seen that I had already downloaded and paid for this game, but they re-advertised it and I thought it was a new game, and since the first chapter wasn't FREE, I was forced to buy it before finding out I've already played it). Second, game prices jumped from two dollars a game to seven dollars a game over night?!? Perhaps this company is going for all new customers and couldn't care less about the old ones, because, as an old customer, I'm getting fed up with these antics."
"9507",1018357323,NA
"9508",1018497986,"Not sure yet."
"9509",1018497986,"But it's VERY short and not at all interactive. Not worth paying 99¢"
"9510",1018497986,"For cardboard it doesn’t render together and causes a lag in one of the dual screens and that is the worse part!!"
"9511",1018704225,"It Is awesome"
"9512",1018704225,"This was a great game there are only a couple of bugs I have experienced, myself. I think the mmo aspect is very cool and adds another layer of depth to this great game. I recommend this game to everyone, as it is a blast to play!"
"9513",1018704225,"Hey, nice game bro. It's fun because you can evolve and it's really satisfying because you can see the money bar go up and you can go like 'Yes I'm making progress!!!'"
"9514",1018743724,"When I first downloaded the game, I was honestly expecting just another endless runner game. I couldn’t have been any more wrong! From the first level, I was captivated by the beautiful soundtracks, graphics, and most of all, the heartfelt storyline. I really love how the storyline is incorporated with each level and the music compliments it so well. I truly felt myself immersed in the characters’ story and felt all the ups and downs just as much! It’s always amazing when a game is made so well that players feel that they are a part of it along with the characters-and this game really goes above and beyond. I don’t think I’ve written a review in about 2 years, and just after playing the first 5 levels I came straight here to write this! I will thoroughly enjoy continuing to play this game, I can’t wait for what comes next! I highly recommend this. Like I said in the title, the developers have truly crafted a masterpiece. Keep up the good work! :)"
"9515",1018743724,"I couldn’t hold myself from crying. One of the best dramas ever"
"9516",1018743724,"I thought there was no music game like Geometry Dash until I saw this, so here is some reasons why I LOVE this game!😉 1. I love the background for all of the levels. I hadn’t played them all but, so far, so good😊 2. LOVE ❤️ the music. 3. WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN MUSIC LEVELS! YASSSSSSSSSSSS! BEST MUSIC GAME EVER"
"9517",1018920593,"I have always wanted a game like this"
"9518",1018920593,"It’s a great for all ages and it’s an addictive"
"9519",1018920593,"Have fun"
"9520",1018922850,"I pay for this and I can’t even preview it without pop ups and an icon that just won’t go away harassing me for a review. Seriously.   So here is your review, jackasses. The lowest I can give. Why even waste your time making an app if your going to do juvenile crap like that.   Idiots!"
"9521",1018922850,"😊😊😊😜😜😜😜"
"9522",1018922850,"Does a nice job custom editing speed of videos. Has some handy filters, too. My favorite thing about this app is the “Live Photo’s” feature that let’s me export them as videos instead of just a single image, even the sound they capture. Sweet app!"
"9523",1018955135,"So far so good with this app. Easy to use and most pics are edited outside of this app then transferred"
"9524",1018955135,"Cutest designs."
"9525",1018955135,"This app makes marking milestones in my daughters life so simple and so adorable!!! It's so easy to use and I wish I would have gotten it ages ago!! I love that you can add stickers and customize colors to make anything look perfect!!"
"9526",1019167420,"Why are there not a million 5 star reviews of this app? It's awesome! Duggee Hug! A-woof!"
"9527",1019167420,"All my kids love this app especially my son who is five and has autism!! It's very much like the show my daughter is four and she loves it as well"

"9529",1019230398,"This is the best $5 you will ever spend. As someone with PTSD and clinical depression, it can be critical to track your moods. This is the very easiest way to do that. This is great for CBT and DBT. It’s great for everyone. It’s like washing your face. It keeps you healthy."
"9530",1019230398,"Excellent excellent excellent app! Please add the ability to print to PDF in REVERSE /chronological order."
"9531",1019230398,"I’m currently a freelance app developer and this application has a design that I envy. I truly wish I had thought of something this seamless, informative, and simple for an app design.  It functions amazingly as journal and mood tracker. I highly recommend for anyone looking for something easy to use daily."
"9532",1019312381,"I had to take it out because its spell word guesses were terrible. So terrible that they force a rewrite. I am writing to fellow attorneys about legal stuff so the la guage has to be fight and there seems to be no way to turn off the spell guesser rewrite of ,y texts."
"9533",1019312381,"As someone else stated, this app does not work on the 2018 iPad Pro. Every time the Hemingboard keyboard is selected as the primary, the iPad stutters, then kicks it back to the default."
"9534",1019312381,"I'm enjoying it, its easy to use.  For $3 and there's no subscription? Sign me up. Well worth the money."
"9535",1019442026,"My daughter is having the best time of her LIFE!!!!"
"9536",1019442026,"It does,t teach anything it does,t teach notes"
"9537",1019442026,"This app is great, when it recognizes the notes you’re playing. It is incredibly frustrating to be constantly stuck repeating the practice mode because it didn’t recognize a note even when the correct note was played. They offer many solutions, but it doesn’t improve the experience. I can easily turn the volume up on my keyboard far enough for the app to (finally) hear the notes, but I’m afraid it upsets my neighbors. Also, I highly recommend regularly returning to the previous lessons to review because the app goes too quickly if just following along. I think this would be bested as a aid to someone already receiving lessons; I don’t believe this is a good enough tool to learn playing by itself."
"9538",1019447011,"App crashes 1 second after i open it every time 🥺 i just wanna watch videos n live concerts pls, i had to cancel my svt and mx subscriptions because i cant open the app."
"9539",1019447011,"Love VLive+ simply to feed my addiction for all things BTS, but why oh why can’t you just let me screen mirror to my Apple TV or better yet it cast directly to my Apple TV?!?!!!!! There was one update a few months ago that allowed me to do it and I was so excited. But the next update seemed to wipe that out and I can’t anymore. Please fix this! Would love to be able to watch it on my TV again instead of my phone."
"9540",1019447011,"it doesnt work on my iphone its just a blue screen when i open it I dont know what to do"
"9541",1019838009,"The game doesn’t seem to be compatible with the current version of Watch OS.. Shame too.. since I just finished the book.  The last update appears to be 2 years ago.. not holding my breath for any further updates."
"9542",1019838009,"it’s fun and there are some problems. overall a great game"
"9543",1019838009,"Remember tamagotchis? Those electronic needy pet things from the 90s? That’s what this is like. They dumb down Mark a bit and give you canned answers to tell him. It’s fun, for all that, but know what you’re getting. <follow up> I stopped playing. Apparently, in this game’s world, NASA is incapable of calculating thrust/weight, and most of the plan they send to Mark is wrong. He dies a lot. It gets tiresome. I have to wonder if the game designers even read the book."
"9544",1019856486,"I've played this game on my Kendal and it was wonderful so purchasing it for my iPad was a no brainer but from the start it's been horrible from taking me 2 days to get it downloaded to repeatedly having issues with freezing and glitches in individual  puzzles."
"9545",1019856486,"Challenges are excellent. Everything worked wonderfully. Well worth the price."
"9546",1019856486,"Good graphics, long game play, hint recharges quickly, interactive map. Hated having to trace the star charts every time you run into an energy force."
"9547",1020119327,"So I REALLY like this game, it’s super addicting and a really fun, challenging game. However, there’s this major glitch in it where my car as well as all the police cars freeze up, so that I can’t move and neither can they. For some reason, the airplanes still move while this is happening, but in like slow motion. Please fix this glitch, as I truly do love this game! Edit— It would also be sooo cool if there was a game mode in which you could just explore the map freely without worrying about the cops chasing you!"
"9548",1020119327,"The game’s not bad I just wish i could get any car other than just common and rare because that’s all I’ve gotten"
"9549",1020119327,"Do I really have to sit through all these STUPID ADS??!!   Can't you just let players have the option to purchase something and then the ads go away??"
"9550",1020187921,"I mean I really like this app but I hate that you have to have subscription to unlock some of the pictures and go actually make your own and stuff and the fact that you have to have Facebook is really annoying cause some people are probably young on this app and don’t have Facebook but overall this is a good app but if you could try and fix that then that would be really appreciated."
"9551",1020187921,"Best coloring app I have ever played! Love the new update!!!!!! Gives colorfly a whole new name. This game is legit the best and only coloring app I will ever have. I just would like to see more free items. If someone (like myself) doesn’t want to pay for the unlimited version, they hardly have much to do or use. If more pallets and pictures could be available, that would make this app even more useful and fun for me and many other users.                    Thanks,                           Pickles3?"
"9552",1020187921,"It is the best all the color,s are so pretty And joy but the only thing is I want music so i wont Be so bored"
"9553",1020273791,"Can’t get in through FB.  Can’t get in if I create an account. Any why do they need my date of birth???."
"9554",1020273791,"How can this be all for team USA without our Paralympic team?! Shame on you."
"9555",1020273791,"They wanted my name, zip, birthdate and year. Then I had to use Facebook login. Too hard. Too much info. I deleted it."
"9556",1020304479,"I have an iPhone and I can’t even register using the app. Waste of digits"
"9557",1020304479,"I love MyDx machine and I own it. However the app accompanying the device is one of the worst mobile app I have ever seen.  App is useless on iPhone SE. Crashes whenever I want to perform test, crashes when I want to email report.  iPad version can only perform test, but often does not detect device and I have to reboot device and restart MyDx app.   App lowers the THC level when searching for similar strains. App list your data in a nonlogic way.  As a user I have no choice than to pray that at least I can perform test.   And company support? Don't even try. They reply on avg. in three weeks and more. And they want me to contact someone else inside company,like they can't talk to each other.   I hope app get better and as a former mobile app UX designer I am more than happy to help."
"9558",1020304479,"I have had my Dx tester for some time. I have had numerous problems with it. I have had a malfunction with the first on I bought and I got the growers package with all the extra stuff. And when I got my replacement Dx tester it was used!! I called the company up and they said it’s his personal machine that he sent me? Why the hell would I want a used machine when I’m buying a new one? Then to top it off the guy don’t want to send me a new one like witch I should have gotten when the first machine stoped working. Now to this date there still not calling me back. MyDx tester don’t even connect any more now I have an extremely expensive plastic paper wait that the company don’t want to come good on. I’ll never recommend this place to anyone. This company is a joke!!!!! From Christopher Sockbeson an unsatisfied customer."
"9559",1020473684,"This was just too weird for me. But I guess if you like absolutely no character development, a sidekick who’s in a coma for basically the entire book, and frequent random teleportations that make you wonder if the protag is just hopped up on drugs the whole time, then read on. But be warned- the basic plot is you getting dropped off on some random bloody planet and being confused the whole. freaking. time.  No actual progress further than that, and the parts with some action have no real risks. There’s just more backstory than I would care to swallow, and I felt myself skipping paragraphs upon paragraphs of some random planet’s history or whatever. Probably not going to buy the next book."
"9560",1020473684,"I'm a big fan of the Heroes saga but I hesitated on Versus based off of reviews saying the story and wording was too confusing. In my opinion, if you're open minded or have read any Sci-Fi novels, you'll be fine. I highly recommend this!"
"9561",1020473684,"I have never reviewed a game before but this one is just to cool not to and I just hop there are many more to come"
"9562",1020481008,"I’ve bought this game in a pick with the other three Go games and I’ve got to say this is probably my favorite one of the three, it’s a good story fun mechanics and puzzles that aren’t that tough and definitely worth the time"
"9563",1020481008,"This was a very enjoyable puzzler that was just challenging enough not to be frustrating to play through. Square provided enough hints to help me through any really challenging levels. It only received four stars because Square charges money for any additional hint units."
"9564",1020481008,"Excelente juego, muy entretenido, te pone a trabajar la cabeza, buenos gráficos y sonido. 👍"
"9565",1020583460,"This is one of the best survival story games that I have ever played. I really hope that a large company with this company can manage to get an expanded version onto a consul or the PC this game is well worth any money you spend on it."
"9566",1020583460,"Finally made it to the 4th city.  Left towards 5, and my character froze. Everything else was working, but he wouldn't move no matter what I did. Not ill, nothing broken...just stopped.  This wouldn't be such a big deal if there was some sort of save progress mechanism...but now I've lost a solid 80 minutes of work. I understand that the Devs don't want a complete save, but something where you get dropped back at the last town without items might be a good trade off..."
"9567",1020583460,"Please add Russian Language! Please Please Please"
"9568",1020818294,"Fun but don’t like the fact that you are required to share in order to unlock colors."
"9569",1020818294,"Am hoping to see more Harvest and Halloween pictures coming. Love the App, though!"
"9570",1020818294,"Love this app!!!"
"9571",1020876671,"I enjoyed the incredibly witty writing. I just wish the game had not ended so quickly. Great way to spend a couple of hours."
"9572",1020876671,"I actually became quite fond of K.O.M.R.A.D., and in the results it mentioned to look out for sequels, which I would LOVE."
"9573",1020876671,"So I bring no hate to the game but one time while I was playing it I got curios what would happen if I failed so I did fail on purpose, after that I failed and it said game I couldn’t even get back into it"
"9574",1020962158,"Simply a masterpiece. The art, story, action, and music combine to make a near perfect game. The world and voice acting is so immersive I can’t believe something like this exists on the app store. 11/10 would buy again and again."
"9575",1020962158,"As I said before perfection!"
"9576",1020962158,"Great voice acting, beautiful music, nicely drawn and animated characters. Overall story is a little bit childish and silly, plus some of the characters are a little too Disney-ish. Plus you get powerful very quick in the game, and the difficulty never really catches quite up to how it is in the first 1-2 hours because you’re so powerful. Still, you manage to die here and there, and it’s a good time beating up all the villains. Plus the voice of your sidekick is adorable. Overall, a nice fun innocent polished game. Keep in mind that those combos rely heavily on timing, and are quite fun once you get good at them! 5 stars."

"9586",1021462578,"I don't write reviews much but this developer has earned it.  I have played DungeonRaid for probably hundreds of hours definitely more than any other mobile game so when I saw Alex had a new game out I jumped on it.  I have played IKHTD for a few months here and there. It's definitely addicting but it's not quite as satisfying. It does not feel like you have nearly enough agency over your fate due to there being such a wide variety of abilities but only being offered a few. This wasn't a problem with DR since leveling up was much faster and more frequent. I keep wanting to try a *build* only to be given what feels useless abilities over and over. When I do finally get the abilities I want normal the difficulty ramps up so quickly I don't get to enjoy it.  I think the game could of been improved by having equal loss of attack and defense. Losing half of your defense every time causes me to treat defense very oddly and not invest in it much. I also think that picking up hearts should count towards events even if your health is full.  IKHTD is worth picking up but if you are here because of DR don't expect quite as satisfying experience. Great job Alex I'll be watching what you do next."
"9587",1021462578,"Please, please, please update Dungeon Raid to 64-bit for iOS 11+!  It was my favorite game, but now I can't play it anymore!  I am playing this game now, and it's very good too. But I miss the seemless flow of playing Dungeon Raid!!"
"9588",1021462578,"So, what would it take to get Dungeon Raid updated or released to public?  Best game ever."
"9589",1021496959,"Loving it"
"9590",1021496959,"Got to play a unique game :)"
"9591",1021496959,"Loved the game :) this circuits took me back to the school days :)"
"9592",1021566244,"Final Fantasy IX mobile port has it ;) 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"9593",1021566244,"..."
"9594",1021566244,"Its just as i remembered, fantastic game true classic. Don’t have issues on ipad without auto save, even when I don’t save as long as i go back on within a reasonable amount of time it is still open.your gonna want to be higher than level 65 to beat sepiroth."
"9595",1021586545,"Just finished the first section. Lots of fun so far!"
"9596",1021586545,"Anyone that’s done any Offroad jumping, knows when you give it gas the rotation of the back tires makes the front come up and when you hit the brakes the drag of the back tires make the frat go down. Whoever designed this game had no clue."
"9597",1021586545,"Gooood"
"9598",1021721629,"Need I say more????"
"9599",1021721629,"I hate this app already and I haven’t even downloaded it yet. What a ploy. Thanks Alaska Airlines for making me put more useless, dysfunctional fecal matter on my phone! 👌🏻"
"9600",1021721629,"It’s good tbh"
"9601",1021845881,"Fun with great graphics"
"9602",1021845881,"Top notch RPG hours of fun with a little grinding."
"9603",1021845881,"But  fun? So far so good"
"9604",1021933645,"This game is kind of weird but so funnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"9605",1021933645,"This game is so cute I couldn't believe it BEST GAME EVER!! My sister wil want it as soon as she sees it I DONT CARE IF THERE Is ADS!!!!!!! It works just fine I laugh at it a lot but the good thing about it is that it's free add more Ratings to help the game please!!! Also the graphics are cute and amazing 😱The cats are so cute I can't stand it when I play It it is so cute and funny"
"9606",1021933645,"This game is very cute, very fun, and very addicting. The ads aren't too bad, and you only have to pay 99 cents to get them removed. I would definitely recommend it!!"
"9607",1021971213,"Simple rules as design disguise incredible depth and complexity.  Bravo."
"9608",1021971213,"This game is perfect. I didn’t get how the game was great at first, but now, after some days, I’m just addict. I understand.  I should have give 5 stars.. but I really want something:  A LeAdErBoArD  I don’t know if I’m the only one who want this, but it’s very easy to add, it doesn’t take place, and the game will not be less good with it.  I love this game but the score is only a personal thing here.  I really want to see and compare my scores with others great players in order to give my best to be ranked as high as possible !  Because actually, I don’t really know what is my level. Am I good ? Could I do more, way much more ? Could I do 1 hundred or 1 billion more ??  Whatever, a simple masterpiece. For me, Simogo is as great as 1button."
"9609",1021971213,"Docking 3 stars because the developer can’t figure out how to add a restart button. You literally have to quit the app to restart the game..why is beyond my understanding."
"9610",1022023000,"Like the game, there are cool puzzles and like this series. However there is something wrong with the HOPs. There are always a few items that need other items to be changed/worked with using an item in the HOP list. For example a necklace may need to be created using beads that are randomly placed around the HOP screen. U have to move each bead to a certain area of the necklace in order for it to be accepted.  It never failed that I would have to try several times to get the bead to be registered. I would have to reselect the bead a bunch of times and move it to different  parts of the necklace before it would accept that bead and add it to the necklace.  This is very frustrating since u don't know exactly where on the necklace should be dropping it so u just have to try a bunch of times in different sections.  If the item you are trying to drop or the item that it is being dragged to are different sizes, then you have to try a bunch of times to get it in the correct place. This also happened if using items that you already found. You select them from the row of items and drag it up to the HOP screen several times in different places before it would register. The game would be awesome if this bug was fixed."
"9611",1022023000,"It’s a fun game but the touch accuracy can be very frustrating."
"9612",1022023000,"I had the exact same problem in this game that I had in the other witches legacy released a week ago called slumbering darkness.  Both games delete your profile and make you start the game over.  I have tried to get through both games a dozen times and get close to the end but the game closes out and I log back in to a message asking me to create a new profile and start all over again.  Extremely frustrating!!  Big fish you really need to put an update out for both witches legacy games just released (dark throne & slumbering darkness) to fix this issue!  I have been a huge fan of your games for many years waiting every Monday and Thursday for new releases.  I never used to have problems with your games before but lately it seems like half the new games get released with glitches, bugs and corruption issues.  Please make sure you guys are releasing quality working games before you release them because you will lose your loyal customers if they keep wasting money on games they can't play.  I'd love to give this game a 5 star rating once I see an update is released to fix the problem, if I never see one I guess I'm gonna have to contact apple for a few refunds."
"9613",1022056495,"Has beautiful scenes and lots of work put into it.  The colors are great. The things we didn't like was load times between scenes, no right or left arrow to look thru the items you found (swiping takes several tries to get it to work), selecting objects or combining them took us several tries most of the time.  After playing  Cursery, the Crooked Man and the Crooked cat (with the black cat on the icon) and thoroughly enjoying it and ease of use, this was frustrating to play a game that wasnt easy to use."
"9614",1022056495,"When you get more than one page of inventory, there are no left or right button to navigate. Swiping left or right is hit or miss and very irritating."
"9615",1022056495,"Great gameplay. Keeps you wanting to play more. HO games are fun, but challenging. Best game I've played in a while!"
"9616",1022196879,"This game and every other game made by Ketchapp is some of the most fun games ever!! Thank you for programming these highly addicting and fun games!!"
"9617",1022196879,"Interesting little fame, but they are trying to do too much. Playing on my iPhone 6+ the game skips and stutters very often. Haven't been able to make it past 12 or so."
"9618",1022196879,"This game has potential, nice looks, good concept, but the tolerance for whether you hit the dot or not is too tight. The idea is you have to hit it when the window of your rocket is over the dot, simple, but if you hit it and it's only half on it doesn't count and you die. A change as far as what counts would go a long way.  EDIT: in the new version they've upped the ability to be able to hit the targets a lot and it's a lot better now."
"9619",1022239163,"👍"
"9620",1022239163,"Easy to play. Addictive and challenging."
"9621",1022239163,"hi tony"
"9622",1022256487,"As soon as you open the app, it asks you to commit for a trial, after which if you forget to cancel, it will charge you. Doesn’t even let you try the app at least a day without committing to a trial. So it’s not a totally free app as advertised. There are many better alternatives which are actually free."
"9623",1022256487,"the button looks really weired on xr pls fix it"
"9624",1022256487,"I’ve been using Sorted (I guess 2) for a while now pretty much everyday, and it is the closest thing to the perfect to-do/scheduling app for me! It’s like Clear, but with better integration of a calendar! I LOVE seeing the color blocks of each task (which sadly they didn’t keep in Sorted3). Honestly, the simplicity of this (like the swipe functions!) is just right! I’m hoping they keep this (even though it’s not in active develoment 😱) because honestly Sorted3 is almost a step towards being too complicated. Truly, thanks for making such a great app in Sorted2! And hopefully it sticks around! (Change is hard, and I know change can be good, but I’m trying Sorted3, and it just doesn’t have the same simplicity that I love from Sorted2)"
"9625",1022267439,"This app is great. Looks natural and has so many choices. I use is for all my pictures."
"9626",1022267439,"Everything about this app is just amazing and the best BUT I do not like how there are only certain filters when you’re editing your pictures/videos form your camera roll. I love the old version where you can actually use all the filters instead of just certain ones. I don’t know if this makes sense but other than that, everything else is amazing."
"9627",1022267439,"I really like the filters on this app, the only thing off about it is that after a few minutes on it it crashes 🙄😬 that might just be my phone though."
"9628",1022301472,"Upgrade home base loot, daily rewards, challenges to win new items and characters."
"9629",1022301472,"Horrible experience. Tried to download, it took 10 min and then when I tried to start the app, it locked up and never did start.  Don’t waste your time on this one."
"9630",1022301472,"I was looking for a good base building game and thought I’d found one. However, the constant ads drove me away specifically the one on the bottom of the screen."
"9631",1022647461,"I like the game, it is very addicting to play. However the amount of ads that keep showing up is ridiculous. I have been playing the game like crazy the last couple of days but I just played my last one. I was looking for a button to pay a dollar to eliminate the ads. I can’t believe I have to watch this stuff in order to play the game. I’ll pay for it. Just stop with the ads for crappy games that I will never play."
"9632",1022647461,"Game is great, but it’s broken on AppleTV. Character doesn’t render, so you only see the skateboard. Some obstacles don’t render, so you only see the obstacles shadow."
"9633",1022647461,"I know everything good but the ads just turn of the WiFi on your phone and boom no ads"
"9634",1022732646,"However, I do not like games in which you have a limited number of lives and have to pay gems, money or wait to get another turn, so I’ve uninstalled."
"9635",1022732646,"This game was fun and challenging and then when I got to level 153 it simply stopped loading. Contacted the game maker twice and it seems they have stopped fixing bugs for this game."
"9636",1022732646,"I basically love games that are a great blend if colorful graphics and intuitive gameplay. This is a game that displays both of these in the best way possible. The devs are seriously on top of their game. Good work."
"9637",1023002643,"I have always like the games in this series and this one is no exception. It is challenging but reasonable, all the clues make sense. I felt it got a little slow in the middle but the story was interesting and the transporting map helps move things along.  Worth the money!"
"9638",1023002643,"Unlike most point and click games, this one is more challenging than most others I have played.  Job well done!!!!!!!!"
"9639",1023002643,NA
"9640",1023026782,"Loved this game :)"
"9641",1023026782,"At first I wasn't sure, but after a few moves...it's pretty good.  Puzzles are fun.  Some easy some not so much."
"9642",1023026782,"Waste of money."
"9643",1023028213,"1. Game doesn't recognize custom settings. 2. Hint button rarely works. 3. Windmill will not accept blades."

"9646",1023146677,"Every time I hear Bonnie’s breathing I close the door but he never leaves is this a glitch or is it supposed to happen."
"9647",1023146677,"I’ve always wanted to play a fnaf game and this is as terrifying as five nights at candy’s 3!  That is a great praise. I haven’t noticed any of the auditory glitches stated in one review. But great atmospheric game. If I could make a suggestion make a vr phone version please if you read this Scott C."
"9648",1023146677,"Updated the game add radar map and new droos and a flaccid lit"
"9649",1023218196,"I love this game so much!! it is one of the most satisfying games i have one my phone. 10/10 recommended"
"9650",1023218196,"I noticed that if you hold your finger on the screen for long enough the food actually cooks."
"9651",1023218196,"It is an awesome game"
"9652",1023681159,"When we first got this game it worked great but now it will crash every time we try to play it"
"9653",1023681159,"This app has nothing for a toddler to activate. Certainly not worth $2.99."
"9654",1023681159,"Frequently crashes on second generation iPad mini iOS 9, even after closing all other apps and restarting the device."
"9655",1023681711,"Like it said up there a nightmare about this app SO disappointing I mean I don't like to write bad reviews but I had to! In my dream my sister almost died! She was stuck in a fire and got hurt!😡😡😡😡😡I mean come on! This is a four year old app! Ugh! Ok if your kid has a fear of GETTING BURNED TO DEATH then DO NOT get this app please...sorry doctor panda This app is horrible anyway"
"9656",1023681711,"It is a fun game but you should have to drive the fire truck. I also think they are not teaching kids manners by saying ""Hey Hey!!"" That really gets annoying."
"9657",1023681711,"It gets kind of boring😶"
"9658",1023683909,"It could be very good with some adjustments"
"9659",1023683909,"The game is ok. Would be a lot more fun if the gameplay was similar to Empires and Allies."
"9660",1023683909,"Good game lots of potential. Still it's a nickel and dime sort of game. Some things cost way to much fission."
"9661",1023741615,"If you like the video you'll hate app.  It's nothing like it."
"9662",1023741615,"I love this game but when the mission says kill an allosaurus it doesn't do anything please fix it please 😞😞😞"
"9663",1023741615,"I love this game~ I've been playing for a bit now and have a little t rex family, the babies are adorable!"
"9664",1023751978,"It’s a great game but needs to get bigger with newer discs and more courses and tournament mode"
"9665",1023751978,"The physics in this game are really great!! Can’t imagine there is a better disc golf game out there. Also nice that the courses are based on famous courses. The discs are nice too. Only downside is there are only five 9-hole courses. Really could use some more as well as 18-hole courses."
"9666",1023751978,"Love it though."
"9667",1024000488,"已经玩了好几个月了，挺好玩的"
"9668",1024000488,"为什么码头飞船任务不搭配玩家等级 出一些根本完成不了的任务 太讨厌了 不能任务跟等级一样的吗？"
"9669",1024000488,"Needs to be fixed."
"9670",1024004804,"こういうゲームをするのは初めてですが、面白いと思います"
"9671",1024004804,"簡単、可愛い… そう、これがヒモ男っ！！"
"9672",1024004804,"Love how you randomly pick a hobo off the street. This game is hilarious. The japanese is simple enough for me to understand which is great."
"9673",1024306067,"Slash mobs is an awesome game with all kinds of mobs to fight, a ton of new hero’s, and it keeps you occupied all the time."
"9674",1024306067,"This game is a fun game to kill time at an airport and other places but I had a chest and I started to unlock it 3 days ago when it took 12 hours to unlock and it is at 10 hours and I do not make offline gold and chest do not unlock when you are not playing I would play a lot more if this was fixed"
"9675",1024306067,"It is a great game but... you don’t get anything while away. Other than that it is a fun game"
"9676",1024374740,"I’ve been trying to play this game for months now and it has a glitch and won’t even load in"
"9677",1024374740,"Great game but I upgraded my phone and it doesn’t work. Can we get this fixed cause I love this game"
"9678",1024374740,"Doesn’t work on iPhone 8"
"9679",1024395159,"Ioving this app and found myself using it on a daily basis, weather I’m sketching a quick idea or up selling my concept to a client. Even on the phone I’m able to give a quick visual of design with signage or vehicle graphics to potential clients before they commit. Game changer!"
"9680",1024395159,"I had done a lot of tries and followed youtube but it doesn't even help enough ... wasted my money, but unfortunally the apple store willing to refund back."
"9681",1024395159,"Well, I had (have) high hopes for this app. It looks like, if they make some needed improvements, it will be a worthy app for tattoo artists. My first big issue keeping me from using it is no Apple Pencil support. My second big issue  is no support. As in, there's no way to email the app developer and get support for questions like ""Does this app support Apple Pencil?"" My third issue is, why the tattoo schtick? Yes, I get that its target audience is tattooers. But can we please remember that as professionals, we are artists first? This app has the feel of ""Real tattoo artist tools for the guy who wants to be a real tattooer when he grows up."""
"9682",1024488164,"It’s funny and has a gripping story"
"9683",1024488164,"The game wasn’t bad per se but I just expected a little more after all the hype."
"9684",1024488164,"I don’t know how this has so many good reviews about its story, because it is so short it doesn’t really say anything. Would not mind that there is in story if there was a fun game to play but searching for the planets isn’t really a game either. Finished in less than two hours."
"9685",1024505111,"The free version is fun but this version HAS SO MANY MORE LEVELS it’s so worth 1.99"
"9686",1024505111,"I beat the free version of cut the rope, I loved it so much I thought I would buy the gold version. But nothing is different! That was a definite waste of $1.99."
"9687",1024505111,"Definitely a good buy"
"9688",1024522751,"I like it and maybe on another update for the app, it should include more minor bug fixes.  Includes the iOS 12 bug fixes"
"9689",1024522751,"They won’t close even after 15 seconds of frantically tapping “CLOSE”."
"9690",1024522751,"Nitrome is flawless. Wish they had more games like this."
"9691",1024818709,"I know what you might be thinking when you see this “just another annoying review on our wait times” well this might actually be better for business. You see you guys already want money when we’re only four seconds into the app. If you let people get to have fun with it and start using a lot then they might wanna make a purchase . Just remember that we need to know if this app is even good quality which it is but you guys ask for too much and try to force us to get to buy the trial but all that does is drive us away from the app .i thought this would be a good app so I got it and right there I’m not even a minute in the story and they want me to wait  4 minutes.thats uncalled for .im not saying that you should delete all purchase options . I know your doing this for some kind of profit ."
"9692",1024818709,"$4.99 a week are you out of your mind?  Listen to all the reviews unlike I did unfortunately. They want basically $20 a month. Netflix, Hulu, prime, etc are all cheaper than this with way more to offer. Seriously don’t download this app or you will be writing the same review as I am."
"9693",1024818709,"So I used to love this app. I am/was one of the few people who paid yearly for it. A couple months ago the developers changed it so now there is only one story on the screen per genre and when you scroll there seem to only be about 5 to choose from. Ever since I have finished those five stories I keep being told “An error occurred and we couldn’t find a new story”  I miss when each genera show a bunch of stories to choose from on its home screen. Furthermore I used to enjoy the pictures but having video stories that automatically play is super annoying and one reason I miss the old version of the app. The developers should go back to that"
"9694",1024951639,"I love this game. I’ve had it for years but could you please update it so that it can be compatible with the newer iPhones? Expand it so that it uses the whole screen or something because it only uses a small portion of my iPhone X and I keep missing shots because my finger goes in the black spaces on the sides. Besides that the game is great!"
"9695",1024951639,"This Game Is Awesome But A Need Support afortunada The New IPhone XS Max. Thanks Anticipate."
"9696",1024951639,"Graphics, music, design, characters, EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL!!! :D"
"9697",1024953824,"While it may be fun to just jump in you need to save your in game money than keep buying into the retirement fund! After that it seems you can keep up the fun from there I can’t wait to see if my strategy works!"

"9699",1024953824,"This is the most fun I have had playing a game in a while. The “rule the world” aesthetic is very engaging and keeps you playing until you have final conquered all 13 of the republics in the campaign mode. The card game combat is very engaging and something I admire. The game is very easy to get addicted to, so if you start playing you might find yourself spend a good amount of time playing this game. All thought I love the game for all it has to offer I wish it had some prestige mode in the campaign. Like if you take over all 13 you can give up your control of the other 12 to  get a prestige which offers you with rewards for prestige. Cause there isn’t much to do after you conquered everything. Great game."

"9705",1025000402,"App freezes and keeps giving. TIME OUT error message. Can’t load or move images!"
"9706",1025120568,"App often won’t play video and audio gets off sync. Sometimes video won’t load. Crashes after commercials so you have to watch them multiple times. I’ve used the app for a while now and always hope the issues will be fixed, but they never are they just change."
"9707",1025120568,"Don’t know what revisions the app has gone through but I would have to agree with every 1 star person as all of their comments were correct. Signing into your provider does not work at this time so this app is basically a waste of memory on my device."
"9708",1025120568,"Tv Providers I DO NOT TRUST because They take away the tv channels that I love to watch. So I use APPLE Tv to watch my tv shows And download apps like this one to watch My tv shows. Location Services you DO NOT NEED Unless you are a SPY. Because I have free tv apps that DO NOT ask for either services. From Jack"

"9712",1025297873,"This game is bad.  It crashes for me, and it's ridiculous how the cup blocks every shot.  Please fix that.  It's also ridiculous how the cpu on your team just stands around and misses pretty much every block."

"9726",1025707485,"Your app is awesome."
"9727",1026311548,"Okay so I live this game, well except the $ it cost but I played it for like an hour, and then my prego women gave birth and came out with her maternity dress just no bump, so I am like how do you get it back! And when I try to move the closet in that room it won’t go! Why! Plz respond or I will report game!"
"9728",1026311548,"Could you put a mall and a house and A make up room"
"9729",1026311548,"So I love the my town games they are really fun I just wish they were cheaper! I think 2.99 would be a good price if the apps had more stuff to do and more rooms. But since they don’t please lower the price to maybe $1  Thx! Your biggest fan, Makenzie"

"9736",1026832671,"Would be fun but constantly messes up and steals levels."
"9737",1026832671,"When will this game be updated?"
"9738",1026832671,"Too hard! Makes it no fun! Needs free boosts more often!"

"9741",1026909621,"Hi dade Thank you for making this game for me it was the best idea I ever had don’t forget to pay me back"
"9742",1027230451,"I have beat all the levels 3 star in a area and it says I’m still missing stars help please."
"9743",1027230451,"Very lag  I quit for a long time and return to play It very lag"
"9744",1027230451,"I agree with lots of the reviews given.  It is an amazing game but even if you spend a lot, there are people who will spend more to be on top.  Plan on either a game you will leave quickly as you become vastly overpowered or commit to spending thousands constantly.  I’m not joking!  Our newest merger has a game developer in it and she even took one of the strongest accounts just because she could.  You can bet she pays a very small percentage of what everyone else does to be on top and bully people.  I still play for now, but will never start a new server since I know how they will all end up."
"9745",1027352017,"This is the best coloring game I have ever played it has all the colors and pictures I love this game thank you for it 🙏🏽🤗"
"9746",1027352017,"I have had this for a long time. When I get free pictures I keep it in the all picture section. The next day all the picture are gone. All my hard work to color those pictures. :( please fix this. All my pictures that I colored or wanted to color are gone. I’m fixing to delete this if it keeps happening. It’s a great app though."
"9747",1027352017,"Please do more free pictures or just make all the pictures free for a day.   I've been doing the $7.99 a week and I is not letting me do the pictures you need to pay for.   Can you please fix that problem."
"9748",1027419374,"I want Daniel tiger’s house and that you can bring groceries outside without it being out of the store and I would really like you to add more to this game I wish I could do you five stars but I can’t because you didn’t add new stuff:("
"9749",1027419374,"I’m 8 and apparently still play this game but  Idk 😐 I feel grown out of it I might play it again"
"9750",1027419374,"Make this available In portrait.  But if you must have the app only available in landscape at least have it face the same way for every Daniel tiger game. I got extremely frustrated with having to flip flop the phone every which way. Requesting a refund."
"9751",1027688889,"I took a small break, and when I re-install it, there are ads every five seconds!! I might as well just go play the actual piano I have, at least I’m not stuck watching millions of ads, and I’m learning something!!"
"9752",1027688889,"I love the game but why v.i.p I mean some of my FAV song are vip ihate it like can you NOT ok I think I am done   Jayden.D"
"9753",1027688889,"I’m deleting this game there are way too many ads. I press a button. Ad. Look to my left, ad. It’s stupid. This used to be fun and now it’s just an ad for Chapters. Took all the fun out of it. I can’t even submit feedback on their game because when you select email it tells you to pick a type contact information.  0/10."
"9754",1028179601,"Never passes loading screen. iPhone X iOS 11.4"
"9755",1028179601,"Seems this app is updated 2 years ago for last time and after purchasing it today I found that it’s not working!!  I need to ask apple to refund the money"
"9756",1028179601,"Bought it & doesn't work at all. The game won't load, just a blank screen. I want a refund please."
"9757",1028362533,"Love Huge Casino. Great games."
"9758",1028362533,"Let me sum up huge casino for you. I’ve got 80,000 spins and only 8000 of them are wins.... if that tells you anything .... RUN. You spend the majority of this game losing and NEVER WINNING. I’ve spent maybe 200$ on this app and was probably better off burning it in my back yard with those win percentages. Avoid this app"
"9759",1028362533,"Ironically, before the update I had over $100M.  After the update, that dropped to zero.  I play mostly conservative.  I think you are punishing me because I don’t get suckered into paying real money for fake chips.  Good luck surviving when you run that hustle on your customers.  This casino game has to be controlling odds. I can’t do anything but break even after losing it all.  Not fun anymore.  Don’t waste your breath (or typing) to say it’s random. No one is that unlucky."
"9760",1028400679,"I’ve been using this app consistently for over two years and I love it! A few things I would love to see in future updates that would put it above and beyond for me: a place for the author, the ability to select a book you’ve finished and see details (author, page count, and ESPECIALLY date finished), books to read tab (maybe the ability to transfer it to your current reads also), and an ability to see how far you’ve surpassed your yearly goal (for example, my goal was 25 for this year and I’m well into my 30s, but I’m not sure exactly what number I’m on). Again, I love this app and its simple design and I don’t plan on quitting it anytime soon!"
"9761",1028400679,"Why would you want to track which page you're on if not for determining reading speed? An app as a bookmark? I can't believe I paid a dollar for that."
"9762",1028400679,"One of my goals this year was to spend more time reading, and this app really helps! The achievements are encouraging and you can easily keep track of/update your goals. It would be very cool if it had a ""Books I Want to Read"" tab—there are so many books I want to read and it would be nice to have a list of them in the app where I am keeping track of the books I am reading. Still highly recommend it if you're trying to read more and/or stay organized along the way!"
"9763",1028464453,"It gets so boring after awhile"
"9764",1028464453,"I can’t get everything on the app"
"9765",1028464453,"Can you please add huckleberry pie and for a candy can you make it pie one because I love PIE two because well duh huckleberry pie please Please please can you do that"
"9766",1028556453,"This is the worst game I ever bought as far as glitches go.  The first time I got stuck in chapter one when I clicked on the car, the screen went beige and I couldn't do anything.  Tried a hrs reboot, nothing.  Uninstalled and reinstalled, got to chapter three.  Instruction pieces would not rotate to fit and I couldn't move forward.  Uninstalled and reinstalled again.  Climbed the bookcase and screen went bright blue.  Hard reboot and it was back.  Got stuck again at the instruction pieces and couldn't move forward.  Deleted the game for good, so mad I paid for it!"
"9767",1028556453,"I got to the parlor area, and the game completely froze. I uninstalled, and the reinstalled, only to encounter the same issue. Furthermore, the parts of the game where speech is involved will cut out, midway through the speech. Don't waste your money on this dud."
"9768",1028556453,"Barely got started in the bonus game and the game crashed. Couldn't get back to where I needed to be to get the 4th piece of stained glass without starting from the beginning! BF has REALLY gone to crap lately. I'm going to go back to reading books. They don't crash. If we all stop buying the garbage they're putting out, maybe they will get the message. We deserve better than this."
"9769",1028558002,"The story is great but the game is very glitchy throughout. Had to delete app and download game again after game wouldn't let me exit the mansion. But after download game seemed to work but game did kick me out a few times. Overall game would be great if there wasn't many glitches."
"9770",1028558002,"I love these hidden object games and play 6-10/month. This is the the second that has been so glitchy I can't play it. I was able to get half way through and now I can't pick up an item in Rocky's cage that I need to advance the game. Seriously disappointed and I feel like I wasted my money. Won't be buying a Big Fish game for a long time."
"9771",1028558002,"Sound synchronization was horrible, voices didn't match up to written dialogue. HOS scenes weren't too bad but not worth purchasing game! Glitchy, over sensitive hint & back button! They're too close together and will bump you out of the game. Best part of the game was the husky dog - Rocky! Whoa this developer needs some serious help! This game blows!! Honestly, I can't believe I wasted so much time on it. Wait, do yourselves a favor...get it when it's on super sale, like .99 cents!!! 🙄👎🏼😒😑😝"
"9772",1028610115,"I used to be a huge fan of ninja turtles I don’t really like them anymore but I used to have this game and I loved it so TURTLE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"9773",1028610115,"It’s a pretty fun game but it’s in need of iPhone X support. This is definitely the kind of game that needs all the screen real estate it can get."
"9774",1028610115,"i thank the game is awesome"
"9775",1028623510,"Best game!"
"9776",1028623510,"Sub to PewDiePie"
"9777",1028623510,"Amazing game, no ads, no glitches or problems. Lot of fun"
"9778",1029033692,"Not too noisy, like some of the other games.  The characters are cute and it’s challenging just enough that you don’t get frustrated."
"9779",1029033692,"I gave this game 5 stars because I just started playing this game this evening and I am already addicted to it. I am also really enjoying this game too. I definitely recommend downloading this game to who ever doesn’t have it."
"9780",1029033692,"The commercials in this game are intolerable. I know that to play a game for free one must watch ads, but there are so many it’s beyond annoying. Deleted this after just playing three levels."
"9781",1029273159,"after a while it gets boring because there is not a lot of modes to play in to improve the game you could add mote game modes"
"9782",1029273159,"This is such a great game to play when bored"
"9783",1029273159,"I like the Game and i have some car s but the Game is  going out of business that is said"
"9784",1029499643,"Really good game and I really enjoy it and recommend it"
"9785",1029499643,"We want more french clubs for RN 17 !!!"
"9786",1029499643,"It is the best rugby came and this is coming from and American but this game is exactly like American football"
"9787",1029588869,"It’s a good game but when I try to get off at the windmill it won’t let me so now I can’t complete the game wow"
"9788",1029588869,"Por mas juegos como esteee!!! La dinamica entre los hemanos los paisajes de verdad que es precioso el juego!!"
"9789",1029588869,"Ok.. so I just finished it, and was very grateful I could find online “walkthrough “ videos to help out because it’s not always easy to figure out what to do/ where to go. It took me more time than I would like to admit, to figure out the two controls at the same time. Having said that, the game is beautiful!! ***SPOILERS **I would recommend that young children be cautioned about this game due to the multiple hangings and suicides seen in the game. It is so heartbreaking that the brother dies. I think it was an amazing adventure! I wish there was a part 2! You definitely get your money’s worth with this game...I’m giving it 4 stars only due to the graphic depictions of the suicides, and need for some more instructions within the game. It was a great adventure!!!"
"9790",1029932207,"I like the game but can you guys upgrade the game so that the quality will be better. For example the pancakeria or  the Donuteria is better quality than the cupcakerita."
"9791",1029932207,"The graphics are extremely fuzzy compared to Papa’s Donuteria. Every time I get to the decorating portion, everything will say either “great” or “perfect” and once I drag the ticket and the customer gets there food, the percentage is around the 50% and 60% when I haven’t forgotten an item nor has it said I did a bad job, making the game less enjoyable. Meanwhile on the computer, the graphics are clearer and easier to play in my opinion. And make Papa’s Sushiria to go! That one was my ultimate favorite along with Papa’s Donuteria."
"9792",1029932207,"The papa’s games are great, I love them, but the older ones desperately need an update. They’re blurry (on the iPhone XS Max)  and don’t have all of the features the newer ones have. Overall, they’re really fun but really need an update"
"9793",1030395486,"I think this really is a good app, but it has two major fail points. The first is that it will not let you change settings, and if you set the difficulty to hard on the configuration it sets it to normal, second it’s still on 1.13 1.15 is coming soon so I hope that is fixedI have a third thing when you leave it spawns you back at spawn. Fix these things and I think this will be amazing"
"9794",1030395486,"App is Trashhhhh"
"9795",1030395486,"Many problems and bugs everywhere need to be fixed. Also the lag for the servers I bad even with only one person playing on the server."
"9796",1030447361,"This is a really great game but after a few day I ran into a glitch where I can’t collect my energy and the time clock is permanently at the max time. Although this game really addicting and is definitely a 5 star."
"9797",1030447361,"Good for CA,CO, and all states where legal but if anyone is growing for real do not download this App!"
"9798",1030447361,"I like this game I could spend hours growing my own pot out of a pot. Haha love it"
"9799",1030487391,"I’m a big fan.   Love commenting and reacting to videos.    Video inside video just got super easy."
"9800",1030487391,"Pretty cool app, I will use for work to narrate some of our product videos. So far pretty easy to use and only took a second to set up"
"9801",1030487391,"It's a great app"
"9802",1030548464,"It is very frustrating... I know it’s a bug, and the developers have worked hard to create this app, but this annoying bug is preventing me from enjoying it."
"9803",1030548464,"I can’t pick up from the last level completed I’m Iphone from iPad. Failed. Don’t feel like replaying from the beginning."
"9804",1030548464,"Any new levels coming?"
"9805",1030634472,"Just a nice game no ads"
"9806",1030634472,"This game is both relaxing and challenging at the same time! There is no pressure of accomplishing the goals of each level yet keeps your mind engaged. Thanks and please keep it updated!!!👍🏻👍🏻"
"9807",1030634472,"I don’t usually do reviews on apps or anything, BUT this game is incredibly relaxing. I have anxiety and this just seems to control it! GREAT GAME!!"
"9808",1030762703,"Great software! The world is finally quiet!"
"9809",1030762703,"It always works!"
"9810",1030762703,"The app is great and helps boosting the browser.   iOS 10.3 has been released, then any update for 10.3 ?"
"9811",1030792602,"This game is addictive. Might there be other ways to earn hints and clues. It costs a lot to play."
"9812",1030792602,"I'm extremely picky with puzzle games and usually drop them after a minute even if I paid for it. But this one is very clever and addicting. At first it's tough to figure out how to play but once you get it, you can't stop!"
"9813",1030792602,"I purchased this game and initially did not like it. I played around with it for a few minutes and once I got the concept, I absolutely loved it. Will definitely keep."
"9814",1030804846,"After a number of ace placements the game will no longer accept ace placements for points. I have downloaded the game a number of times and the problem has repeated itself after a few games. I have also been a paying customer as I greatly enjoy the game."
"9815",1030804846,"Game 52, looked at game # right before making my last move. After the game completed game 52 for me, the game had changed to “Random”.  Game shows as not won.   Is anyone listening?  On occasion, while playing one of the campaign games, the game number changes to “Random.”  This has happened a number of times and appears to be increasing in frequency.  Of course if I win, the campaign game doesn’t show as a winner.  This problem has surfaced several times today. (8/10/19). Most recently game 270.  I “won” the game but the game indicator turned from “270” to “Random” within probably the last 3 to 5 moves.  8/13/2019 happened again. Didn’t note the game number"
"9816",1030804846,"Last time I bought the UNDOs, paid for them...and when it started to update to add them  purchase to my game, it locks up...saying LOADING. It just sits there spinning...and never completes the loading.  Help!"
"9817",1030815031,"It’s so bad doesn’t even open DO NOT GET THIS APP totally crap 💩🙄😑😑😑"
"9818",1030815031,"Pretty lousy app if you can’t even do enough regression testing to ensure it actually opens on most devices. I have an iPhone 7 Plus. Sure, a couple years old now, but there’s no excuse for this app not to work with it. 99% of the other apps i use or have tried work fine with my phone. Don’t bother with this one."
"9819",1030815031,"App won’t load at all. Disappointed"
"9820",1030902626,"This game is missing a thing from the pc version, object editor."
"9821",1030902626,"Do this and I will give you 5 star"
"9822",1030902626,"Why no object editor?"
"9823",1031002863,"When I use this app  it takes my mind out of all the drama in my life and lets me think about something else ❤️ I love this app!!!! Though I wish I could be a VIP some other way than pay 💰"
"9824",1031002863,"I love that we have the choice of coloring one of each image the way another person has colored it, PLUS for a short time of coloring that image “from scratch” using our own choice of colors. I also love that this app is very unobtrusive - meaning there are not too many icons moving around on the screen telling/showing the user what to do. It truly is a relaxing app!"
"9825",1031002863,"IT’S SOO COOOOOL everyone’s art is so beautiful!"
"9826",1031021466,"Absolute perfect tool for me as an (legal) immigrant from Europe! New interface such an improvement.  Keep up the good work guys..."
"9827",1031021466,"If only all apps were visually this appealing."
"9828",1031021466,"Apple Watch app does not work without setting up Shortcuts on iPhone..this is ridiculous."
"9829",1031088612,"希望能在iPad版本中可以支援橫屏顯示，非常感謝"
"9830",1031088612,"新的通知中心部件很不错，就是希望能对 up next 的时间突出显示（比如就没有位置信息），过去事件可以隐藏。"
"9831",1031088612,"The description is Chinese.It should be English!"
"9832",1031152574,"I love this game. It’s pretty accurate with the blood and gore so watch your kids."
"9833",1031152574,"I can’t even get past the door man in chapter 5 and the skybar is            Stupid this game so stupid 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😱🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡"
"9834",1031152574,"The game is great overall but the level skybar ruined it for me. I while back when I had the game before I uninstalled it and downloaded it again I was able to get past it somehow, but I was just really lucky. When you get to the skybar your only given like 1.5 seconds to kill all 5 people. A problem I have with this is that you start off in the elevator before the door opens. During that time you can’t even pull your gun out so you have to wait til the doors open which uses precious time."
"9835",1031155880,"Wonderful"
"9836",1031155880,"You're missing the Aurora on Jupiter and some of her electrical static lightning within or storms   The coloration and detail on Pluto is not completely accurate  Being able to float alongside the satellites going around the planets would be nice too"
"9837",1031155880,"Why pay for an app that gets outmoded? So you can pay again, silly!"
"9838",1031228862,"Dahl best game ever"
"9839",1031228862,"Im on level 10 but i cant finish because i cant see the bottom tile? PLEASE FIX THE GRAPGHICS SO ALL OF THE TILES CAN BE SEEN!!!"
"9840",1031228862,"Been playing 2 years except some hard levels its great game."
"9841",1031388734,"Does not work at all. After paying and discovering this I read the same thing in other reviews over a year ago? Does the developer even respond? No."
"9842",1031388734,"This game does not work and I want my money back"
"9843",1031388734,"Beware:::::  this game does not work, wish I would have listened to the other people who said it did not work. They were right......... so unless you want to be ripped off don’t spend your money. There’s a reason they want u to pay before u can try it out....... so they can steal your money.  Thief’s..............I can’t stand one, especially since I have spent hundreds if not thousands of money with big fish....they should be ashamed and banned from store."
"9844",1031390478,"Enjoyed it"
"9845",1031390478,"Great detective story, really keep you going."
"9846",1031390478,"This game is great ,I just wish I could hear it😥"
"9847",1031391869,"Love this app for keeping track of shows I want to watch. Would love to be able to sort the ""continue watching"" section shows in a custom order, as I'll often throw new shows on the list to watch down the road and they'll get added to the top of the list."
"9848",1031391869,"As a kid this this very simple and easy for me to use 10\10"
"9849",1031391869,"Please, please, please. Just make the Apple TV the same functionality. I hate the use of “bookmarking” my shows from my iPhone. Have the app be similar if possible"
"9850",1031406492,"Great app. Love trains and this is very realistic."
"9851",1031406492,"I think this game is awesome, except for a few things: when you start a session, and u have to leave the app or turn off device it does not save your progress, you have to start over, please fix. Second, I like steam engines, there are 5 different steam engines, not five different steam trains, but engines, 3 are blue comet, I only wish there were more steam engines to use. Last, but not least, I think there should be updates, and not every update has to have something added, just updates to let everybody know you are still working on the game. Other than those 3 things, the game is awesome."
"9852",1031406492,"Free ride is little and on the first train driver journey add steam trains and put a free ride It’s still a good game in this game which is is train driver journey 4 add Thomas the tank engine and his friends"
"9853",1031530508,"Perfect game, but the bug that was stated to be fixed in 1.6 is still present.   Reproducing the issue (if it was different before): Teleport the player to the left side, flipping the gravity and then teleport key balloon above the smoocher. Flip the gravity again and then teleport the player on top of the smoocher. This should crush the player against the balloon, but it crashes the game.  I’m on an iPhone 8, if that makes any difference."
"9854",1031530508,"One of a few number of games that I have enjoyed at all. 100% recommended"
"9855",1031530508,"Whenever I play it just flashes the rainbow it says the play button I click it nothing happens then a bunch of ads go on my screen.Then my Device Turns black and a my battery dies because of your stupid game!"
"9856",1031569021,"Everytime u keep addin new dumb monsters. Like seriously the things u give the new monsters is just way too overpowered like why"
"9857",1031569021,"Me encanta este juego. Lo tengo en mi teléfono por mas de 2 años. Pero siempre escribo la misma reseña...  las actualizaciones tardan demasiado. Creo q ya va un año sin actualizar el juego."

"9859",1031706898,"Apparently it doesn’t want to load. I am being kicked out each time. With the hopes of getting to the game. I have a 8+ , fix the bug please."
"9860",1031706898,"The game used to be FUN! But for some reason the game itself automatically closes or should I say crashes as soon as I try to open and play it. How can I possibly enjoy a game that I can’t even PLAY OR OPEN!!!"
"9861",1031706898,"I can’t even play the game. It keeps crashing😭"
"9862",1031781908,"First off, this app is beautiful hands down. There is no question about that.   However, when it comes to actual FUNCTIONALITY. This is where the app fails. All I want to do is check what the weather is and what the weather will be later in the day. One of the feature lists out that it shows hourly weather but I don’t think this is the case??? I’ve literally spent forever to find it and alas - nothing.   The developer responded to one review saying that there was a tutorial uploaded but where is it? This seems to be all lies and kind of sketch to charge a customer to invest in app that literally doesn’t do what it says it does.   I’m very confused as to why there 100+ reviews and 4.5 star rating. Please help me out."
"9863",1031781908,"I had difficulty with turning the 24 hour clock to a 12 hour readout, and got an immediate email telling me how (tap it). I love the simplicity and elegance of the screen. Totally worth 99 pennies."

"9871",1032040117,"This site will never give or receive items someone pays for. In fact the first response is always to contact app provider to get a refund.  All those who allow this app to sell knowing that what service they provide is fraud are just as reliable if not more responsible since its their name first that everyone sees. My advice is stay far away to avoid this scandalous site.  If you have been ripped off like so many others you can thank the providers for allowing this. After all with out them they wouldn’t exist. Keep that in mind and start putting the liability where it belongs. After all if you can take money without providing the service you claim to sell. Why would you when you have a platform that doesn’t care."
"9872",1032040117,"For the 1st year I’d say playing LGOH was freaking Awesome! But then I started getting these new pre-patches boasting new legends “tier 3 characters new game format etc.” then the game just starts dropping, I’m thinking to myself, ok just some growing-pains right?  But most unfortunately so begins my terrible experience with this game. “I’ve been playing over a year now I’m lvl 233” & yes I have reported my concerns/game issues many times but it has not been resolved. LGOH used to be real fun & for the first 175 lvls or so I had only minor connection hick-ups but game was pretty consistent. However it seemed the further I progressed in the game the more prevalent the dropping connection problem became. There is a problem with this Application or my Apple i6 so which is it?  I don’t think it’s my cell. The game drops & drops & drops. There is something wrong with this game.   Save your game time for something that is consistent. Save your money too because this game may say free but if you want to progress & be viable your going to pay. And then when game drops you are going to be pretty darn frustrated. Mind you customer support will write you back & they are polite & all but they have yet to resolve this problem."

"9878",1032308323,"I LOVE HOW CUTE AND FUN THIS IS!!❤️❤️❤️❤️ It’s so fun and amazing and cute! Keep on with the good work and always make this game your PRIZED!! Though I will look at your other games but...This is my fav"
"9879",1032308323,"This game is very cute and i like it alot but i can’t seem to expand my land to be able to build more stuff. Seems like they are forcing you to buy with real money. I’m starting to loose interest."

"9882",1032381310,"I love this game but it suddenly froze up on me and wouldn’t allow me to do anything! I had to uninstall the app and when I reinstalled it and attempted to open it, it completely froze up my phone to the point that I had force restart it!!! Fix this issue!!!"
"9883",1032443533,"I really really like this game but... I know the developers need to make money but game seems rigged.  I can get just so close and fail over and over. Almost like they feed your frustration and you pay. As I did. But, I paid and didn’t get lives, gots coins!!! Grrrr.  I just wanted to play. There is nowhere you can find out how many hearts or coins you need to play each game. Why can’t you trade coins for hearts?!?!"
"9884",1032443533,"Quit over a year ago.  Tiresome with issues.  Missed this game. Got it back up about a month ago.  With this new autumn leaves thing. Not properly credit me with wins.  So tiresome.  Yeah, message is QUIT this game and walk away.  Meaning uninstall."
"9885",1032443533,"Great and very addicting 👍"
"9886",1032708262,"I have never had anything bad to say about this game. It keeps me coming back with the unlocks and characters, and gets my blood pumping with gems as I fly through the increasingly difficult levels. You really care about how much health you have and upgrades will truly help you stay alive in this action packed adventure. Starting above the well on the surface really tops things off.   The one thing I would like to see change is iPhone X full screen support. It would let the player see much more of the screen with less finger in the way. To be honest if you never changed it I would still play everyday. It would be nice though!  Fantastic game 5/5  *UPDATED REVIEW BELOW*  Wow, this game hasn’t left my phone since I downloaded it. And that’s saying a lot because I get bored of games really quickly. You would think there’s not much to do, but that’s the beauty of it; you are perfecting the art of falling in a way that hasn’t been done before!  Reaction time, patience, and a few minutes are the ingredients for a good time in Downwell. But there’s nothing stopping you from playing it like a slow paced Mario level!  With the characters, upgrades, shop items, and pallete options, this game can be played in countless ways! Amazing!!!!!!  Oh and the only thing I would have added has been added just recently! iPhone X support!"
"9887",1032708262,"I’ve had this game for longer than I’ve ever kept any game downloaded for, probably all games on my iPhone combined for that matter. After years of playing I finally made it to the last boss. Not because it’s too hard, it’s not, it’s fair with its snappy and crisp, ultra responsive controls that make every mistake your fault and your fault alone. I’ve never play an iOS game that performed better and had 0 input lag like Downwell does. It’s genuinely designed to keep you playing and coming back to enjoy another round and attempt to find out what is at the bottom of the well, if anything at all. The upgrades don’t carry with you at death, you amass them every time you reach a new level/depth each run through. The color palette swap was a HUGE part in keeping me playing and engaged as the more colors you unlock, the more complex and varied the next one becomes. besides the incredible gameplay of course lol It rewards you for playing and doesn’t lock anything away behind progression that could hinder you in jumping down the well for the first time and beating the game. But I promise, you won’t. Seriously, you won’t lol it’s hard. But hard in an incredible way, not artificial to pad length. Only thing locked is visual perks that change the aesthetic and also different play styles. which can change gameplay dramatically if you want a new way to play or challenge to unravel. And the gunboots. I could talk about them forever. So many different kinds. Although my only advice or WANT would be for the devs to include a DLC pack of MORE gun variations in the future. The game is perfect the way it is but as an option to enhance and switch up a game I’ve played and sunk prolly 500-700 hours into over the years, I’d love MORE GUN MODS. I’d pay double maybe triple what i payed for the game originally for the option to load the game with even more crazy guns to find when descending down the well. It would give a boost of content and happiness to an already incredible game, and base of players that have been itching for an update to a game that they love so much. I even love the game so deeply it has become the only game I’ve ever bought cross-platform other than Stardew Valley and even ended up enjoying the game even more on my Switch. This is a mobile game at heart and it’s a mobile game that is worth $15-$20, hands down, it’s that good. I’ve never seen it priced above $3 dollars ever. I really think it’s one of the most underrated and under appreciated games of all time. And just one of the best games of all time for that matter. Stylized with incredible use of retro graphics with modern effects that give it a gorgeous look and feel, and controls so responsive I couldn’t believe that I had never noticed another game that matched its precision. I love this game, truly I do. I hope someone that’s on the fence on wether they wanna spend a couple bucks on a game on their iPhone reads this and is persuaded because it’s MORE than worth it for the price they’re asking. They’re Essentially giving it away for free if you ask me. I want Downwell to get more praise and more attention and more downloads for the fun it’s extended to me. It and it’s developers deserve so much more praise; it’s a simple concept flipped on its boots and man does it really pull off what a game is supposed to be at its core, fun. Extremely fun."
"9888",1032708262,"I game has amazing graphics, great gameplay and just amazing! But if they would add a “well editor” to make and share your “Wells” would be a great feature"
"9889",1032743715,"More updates please I completed the game and I have to wait months for one update"
"9890",1032743715,"First, I wanted to say that I know that I just wrote a review a few minutes ago, but I forgot a few things...  Second, I think the game should have an update soon so that you could fix everything...  Third, there should DEFINITELY be more figures!!!   Thank you,  ZvsJ"
"9891",1032743715,"Thank you sooooooooo. Much for making this game. It’s the best teen titans game I ever played even better than Roblox my favorite character is all the ravens I love raven she is sooooooo super cool that’s why I gave it 5 stars"
"9892",1032845453,"My friend and I made up games and played it with him but some of the elements are little Bad but you know also I feel bad for anyone who downloaded this app and didn’t have the robot."
"9893",1032845453,"I love this little guy but the antenna came off and it is not working i am a little sad because it was a lot of fun!"
"9894",1032845453,"Love this app so darn much. Love my bb8 too! Amazing Ness! Now I will go play the app all day 😂"
"9895",1032934485,"This games is amazing I love it so much. But you should lose some points for not turning on you signal button on"
"9896",1032934485,"I think that this gas me is great but I think it needs more stuff like highways, more levels on career, more cars, and people.I also  think cars should stop if they see you coming it is annoying.On career mode there are these hills and 3 roads that no cars are allowed to go on why?I also think that there should be rain and snow.So if you could do that in the next update or 2 the game would be so awesome"
"9897",1032934485,"I love this games so much there are a few things I want added. On free mode can y’all add traffic lights to make it more fun instead of just riding around,also can y’all bring back the parking lot, one last thing on career can we go over the bridge thing maybe y’all should add that to y’all new levels and free mode!"
"9898",1032997004,"You spelled penguin wrong! I will delete the app until the error is fixed! Otherwise the app is great! Thank you for your cooperation. I look forward to meeting you in the future!"
"9899",1032997004,"It’s a fun game but there are many glitches and after a while it starts to get boring bc it’s so repetitive."
"9900",1032997004,"I love playing this game, especially when I’m bored, but there haven’t been big fixes in 2 years. If you’re gonna have ads always covering the screen to keep your app up and running, at least use that money to keep your app from crashing every other game and losing coins all the time. It’s a waste of time if I can’t play the game like I used to without all the bugs and problems anymore."
"9901",1033014013,"Every Time I open the app an add pops up when I start playing and ruins my score. Not good. Other than that, I love the game. Very addicting."
"9902",1033014013,"WHY THE HECK WOULD YOU THINK POPPING ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME IS A GREAT IDEA?!"
"9903",1033014013,"Don't waste your time on this one. It's barely worth my time to write this, but I'm on the toilet and I'm about to flush this crappy game."
"9904",1033049991,"Very fun."
"9905",1033049991,"I needed to use quite a few hints towards the end. Maybe more matching tiles/completing pictures would be a good addition to future games."
"9906",1033049991,"Nothing groundbreaking but always a good time from Syntaxity."
"9907",1033229197,"Love all things Ys, except this (chronicles) port—which I now despise. On a platform with d-pads and buttons chronicles is epic, the mobile ports however (what with having to drag your finger around and/or mash spots in the corners) is unplayable garbage for anyone with hands larger than an eight year old thanks to how easy it is for said actions to obscure ones field of view—which typically results in repeated death during boss fights (to the point of rage).  My review: this/these port(s) should be buried in the desert next to NES ET."
"9908",1033229197,"There is sound problem on iPad Pro 2, iOS 11.2.6 I can’t hear anything on Game."
"9909",1033229197,"It was 20 years ago when I played Ys game for the first time. Thanks for bringing that beautiful memory back to me."
"9910",1033282601,"My question is.. Will there be any new added characters? Like classic rat king, panda kahn, classic Casey jones, classic slash, triceraton, groundchuck, dirtbag, classic April O'neil, Tatsu (first movie), wingnut, Ace duck, and classic movie Shredder just to name a few.."
"9911",1033282601,"Awesome game worth the effort, it only gets better😃 The longer you play the more fun you will have!"
"9912",1033282601,"Love this game very addicting I started not too long ago when I was young in 2016 I downloaded it and hated it but I change and I am 13 I love idc if they say tmnt is for babies it is fun probably better than the Jurassic world the game not judging it but just saying I have Leo Donnie space Ralph and larp Mikey that is my turtle so far I like it though it evolves and I have 0 vs tournament points though I grind the tournaments to get the points to get the turtles daily and level 33 and keep using my pizza to ge try dna cards for my best team though I don’t like it cause I like the challenges where you get 1 Ralph dna because I so far have 53 out of 70 and I like it how so my goal is to get the turtles and splinter and get all the cards to level them up to max 100 and a very good journey so far."
"9913",1033342465,"It was working great. Now record from my swatch is not syncing to phone."
"9914",1033342465,"Doesn’t work.  Don’t waste your money.  It won’t transcribe."
"9915",1033342465,"The design and ease of use towers over all the other clumsy recording apps on the App Store, tho this one is hard to find just through a search. I’ve been using it for years and best feature to me is the ability to record wav in different but rates. My only wish feature wise is that gave some more gain control on levels and the like. That would take it from “voice recorder” to serious audio enthusiasts."
"9916",1033387365,"有趣"
"9917",1033387365,"既然让海外玩家一个活动做不了，海外上线做什么？为什么不能出几个服务器专门海外玩家时间呢"
"9918",1033387365,"首先，游戏挺不错，画质精致，声优都很棒，剧情也凑合，是个挺好的手游。 比较大的问题第一就是圈钱吧，这都好说，毕竟人家也要挣钱。但是不能忍受的就是这个实名制之后的防未成年系统？每天只能两小时加上21:30-8:30不能玩？两小时也就算了，我人在美国，这13小时的时差你是要我半夜玩？？能不能稍微调整一下，考虑下时差的问题让我每天两小时也凑合。"
"9919",1033521131,"Just want to give a shout out to probably the best free game (besides swordigo) on the App Store.   Ty devs.  (Pls come back and update/make a part 2)."
"9920",1033521131,"I completed every level, gotten every star, every class all 5 stars trained. I’m stumped on want to do now that I’m finished. I have thousands of gems and coins, nothing to spend on. BUT the game is really fun and I insist on other players to continue on. Also, please nerf Bigfoot boss. Took me 4 tries to complete and complete the objective."
"9921",1033521131,"It is a great game, but can you please add more content."
"9922",1033617377,"when i downloaded the app and tried to play it, it wouldn’t get past the loading screen with all the sponsors."
"9923",1033617377,"Glitch on level 3 challenge 3 only grabs does not score correctly"
"9924",1033617377,"Great graphics calm music while your riding and great updates"
"9925",1033645055,"Don’t work"
"9926",1033645055,"Give me my money back it doesn’t work"
"9927",1033645055,"This app don’t work I would like a refund please"
"9928",1033679736,"It’s a great game, but some missions can be really annoying. If you could skip a mission and get a new one maybe once per day or something then it would be a lot easier to progress"
"9929",1033679736,"Ok, I saw this game being demoed on Markiplier’s YouTube channel a while back (as of this review) and gave it a try. So far, I’ve been enjoying this game as a quick time waster. It’s challenging enough to not being a waste two dollars but not to the point of being aggravating. Yeah there are runs that get you right off the bat or runs that you did really well and end on some stupid mishap, but keep at it. For me I’m stuck at trying to get the “get to the deepest part of the planet” achievement while still trying to get to the second military base on most of my regular runs.   Overall it mostly bug free with the exception of a minor animation bug of the death animation doesn’t go off, to put it of the lack of a better way. When the character that I’m playing as dies by an alien or a mine they will often freeze up or get into the loop of hitting ground if it happens when they’re falling (I still see the ghost appear and still able to go to the menu). There is another bug that I haven’t had in a while is the “go back” in the menu won’t work. It might still be there or I may have been missing the actual button, but I do think it worth mentioning."
"9930",1033679736,"I would give 5 stars but some of the missions are  ridiculous. Chaining gold streaks are the worst. You have to tell people how to chain a gold streak. I hardly ever make reviews, but sometimes it can get really frustrating when you can’t complete a mission because of dynamic maps. There are cases when there is no way out of digging. And it takes a super long time to get past areas. There should be a rewind or power up that at least revives your life. Just my thoughts."
"9931",1033682827,"Gameplay lags, storyline is boring, graphics are dark. Just doesn't hold my interest."
"9932",1033682827,"I've played this three times now and enjoy it more each time.  Great story and flow of action. I especially liked the indicator for collectableson each scene so you can keep searching till you find it (really extends game play). Excellent graphics, sound and story. Great job. Worth every penny"
"9933",1033682827,"I usually don't rate the games, but I have to say I really like this one!"
"9934",1033685038,"Really enjoyed this one. Love this series. Some of the HOS where dimly light which is hard on my old eyes but all in all very enjoyable. Almost the perfect game for my taste."
"9935",1033685038,"Pros: Really nice graphics, creative varied game play with multi-layered HOGS, good transporting maps, decent voice-overs and no glitches.   Cons: No real story, no emotional involvement whatsoever, no diary that can add some depth to the story, and on a technical side, have to get to the map through the menu with way too many steps and no back button and it's too easy to accidentally hit the guide button because of where it as located. Also, 90% of the mini games were WAY too easy, often completable in about 10 seconds. Towards the end there were a few that took a bit more thought and time to complete, and there was one I had to skip because I knew the solution, but couldn't get the controls to move correctly...   If this had a story, more dialogue, character development, a diary and a bit more challenging puzzles, I would have bumped it up to 5 stars. There was an opportunity to make this into a good story, not sure why it was completely neglected..."
"9936",1033685038,"Really wanted to play this, graphics are Beautiful!... just way too intently depressingly angry feeling for me. Am interested in more of adventure-type stories (tho nt necessarily cloying ones; could b w/animal friends). Thank you    OK, now am playing it. It's OK, puzzles are good."
"9937",1033781064,"I love this game but when I got out of the game to charge my phone I thought nothing was wrong but when I got back in the game it hasn’t loaded yet it’s just stuck on 50 percent"
"9938",1033781064,"spent $2 on the starter pack and got a crab and seahorse but had to delete app and it’s data because it wouldn’t open up even though I tried with both wifi and with my own Verizon wireless data. Restarted my phone as well but nothing opened the app"
"9939",1033781064,"I like the game it’s always fun and I have great luck in it. But at one point I couldn’t log in. It said please check your network connection. I did and it was just fine. So I decided to delete the game then download it again. It did the same thing. I couldn’t log in. I was wondering why because as soon as I saved my progress on Game Center, it stopped. Please fix this."
"9940",1033873301,"I NEVER play games on my phone, but this one has me. I feel like it engages my brain and exercises my mental capacity while I feel ridiculously compelled to solve each puzzle. I love it. I’m positive it will be the only game I ever play."
"9941",1033873301,"Enjoy a challenge?"
"9942",1033873301,"I love puzzles and I love the pace of this game! You will too."
"9943",1034018838,"I get it that there are ads to keep the game going, however. After every 2 knockouts/kills there's an add? As for Iphone X, the game doesn't fully fit the screen, so if i go to settings or something, the game won't let me close out of the settings app from in the game, so i'm forced to close app and restart it. Among that, since the game doesn't fully fit the screen, there are black bars on the edges, and coins, items, and gems fall off the tile set, and they don't get collected. Please fix somehow, someway?  Are we due for an update anytime soon?"
"9944",1034018838,"I loved this game and I used to play it a lot so I downloaded again just now and it was just how I remembered but since I got a new phone (iPhone x) the sides of the screen are black which was not a problem but then I realized that my coins and diamonds would fall through the map so I hope they fix that problem cause I really like this game and I guess it’s just a glitch they haven’t fixed yet."
"9945",1034018838,"Sometimes the boss disappears but if I change the map he is back😧!"
"9946",1034019709,"This game has stolen my money and double charged me for items, like the vape, and the shotgun. But y’all seen the zombie ?????😳"
"9947",1034019709,"I haven’t played this game in forever and I even deleted the app but now you guys have charged $50 to my account for whatever reason I DO NOT KNOW! Please refund my money ASAP and cancel any subscription you all think I may have‼️"
"9948",1034019709,"this game is the best and i love it but please fix the freezing that occurs constantly! it’s so annoying trying to restart it and it only works for a little bit"
"9949",1034091427,"The game is fantastic it's just way too scary I can barely even play it"
"9950",1034091427,"I'll give it five stars but, it is really hard because in chapter three, in the kitchen the zombie lady is there most of the time and I can't get around her without having to hide. Two, the werewolf of fever swamp, won't let you get around him without having to hide either. Otherwise I give it five stars and it is super fun. All you need to do is add a few of new chapters that lets you go outside and have a couple of new characters from the new characters. Please get me back with the answer. Talk to you soon. Thank you"
"9951",1034091427,"Ok so I love goosebumps night of scares when it came out I screamed to my mom ""MOM CAN I GET GOOSEBUMPS NIGHT OF SCARES?!? IT ONLY COST 5 DOLLARS"" and my sweet loving caring mom was like"".....alright fine"" so she bought it I got on level 3 and I couldn't get off the ad please fix this and the girlwhowaited   ty for agreeing with me"

"9954",1034201612,"Great game!"
"9955",1034310786,"Well I’m not saying it’s Horrible but it just needs Some work with some things but it’s ok apart from that...."
"9956",1034310786,"Can you add a feature where we can change clothes? And a jet pack? Can you also make it so we can by the police station? and some super speed and super strength?"

"9962",1034523226,"I Saw this app on A Add 2 times and got it And I love it I Can learn Spanish And lots of other stuff! Keep up the good work guys!"
"9963",1034523226,"I purchased the lifetime pass on my iPad as I always do. I purchase all apps on my own phone or iPad to review before allowing my children to play them. After spending over $90 on this app it will not allow me to put the app on my twins iPads without repurchasing. I use my iTunes account for all three iPads, so I’m unsure why it’s not working. I have no use for the app on my iPad and I will not allow my 3 year olds to play with mine. Complete waste of money!"
"9964",1034533362,"I think I broke the game, high score is 1210/44 Good game btw"
"9965",1034533362,"How can a challenging Game not have the option for a beginner level ?!  I noticed you were able to put a settings button on the screen in order to bring in more money by getting rid of your ads. So I know you have the potential to put a set his button that changes the skill level.   Oh...wait... Let me guess we have to pay for it before we have the option to change levels??  I can't even make it through three screens before I fail because of the speed.  My brain needs a little practice at a slower pace to understand what I'm asking it to do.  Just sayin"

"9967",1034630958,"Lags wayyy too much and advertises inappropriate content. 😡🤕🙅🏻‍♀️"
"9968",1034630958,"In my review I’m gonna say why I gave this game a 3 star rating. The first thing I don’t like about this game is that you can not pause the game.another reason why I gave this a 3 star rating is because of bugs when you tap it does not always work, but this game is addictive and a lot of people have down loaded it the reason why I did not give this game a 1/2 is because I enjoy it and the only things it needs to fix/upgrade for this to be a 5 Just add a pause button and fix the bugs.hopefully you can fix those two things thanks for reading this!(BTW cute/funny animals(:!"
"9969",1034630958,"I am the best"
"9970",1034658841,"I enjoyed the web version so was pleased to hear about the mobile. The game is fun, can be chunked into reasonable play sessions, and if you aren’t a power gamer, will last a while.  My only critique is wishing they had an easy to find monster encyclopedia."
"9971",1034658841,"Lots to earn, fun system, all characters are different mechanically - just play it, it’s really good."
"9972",1034658841,"The game is so skewed against the player, you will loose all the time. Game is just not fun."

"9976",1034933180,"My daughter (4) loves this game, and as a parent it's okay.  However, the most frustrating thing is that her established games are easily deleted making her have to start all over again.    I also wish that as the game progressed so did the challenges."
"9977",1034933180,"Useless Shimmer and Shine Game #3.  Directs to an ad longer than the game every other sequence.  Don't waste your time."
"9978",1034933180,"I love this app! I've got all the genie prizes and I also wish for a place where you can play with the prizes! (Just an idea)"
"9979",1034934076,"this is a great game and My dad bought this for me because he thought I would really like this and I did and I think this is a great game for age 3-12 but if people not in 3-12 who like it is still good and I love this game"
"9980",1034934076,"This game is very well made. The graphics and music are great. BUT there are only 4 levels that are very similar. Please add more levels. We need more Shimmer and Shine :)"
"9981",1034934076,"It's fun to pass time and my 4 year old daughter loves it (and can play by herself) however, there needs to be different levels of hardness. It's too easy and there isn't room to grow! You get 4 levels, that's it. Also, the delete button needs to have a lock option! My daughter keeps hitting it and erasing the entire game along with all the progress/prizes won. I hope to see slight changes soon 😊"
"9982",1034995058,"This is such a good way to keep up with all of the current events. It breaks everything down and explains it really well. 10/10 recommend it for both those newly trying to keep up to date and also those who are looking for more easy ways to get the news. This is by far the most approachable way I’ve found so far. It even breaks down terms commonly used in articles that people new to these discussions may not know."
"9983",1034995058,"I am a more informed person because of Skimm and well rounded information makes me more interesting. Thank you Skimm."
"9984",1034995058,"I really dislike the navigation the app"
"9985",1035142291,"Thank you for fixing this app! I’ve been hoping it would work again one day, and you’ve done an amazing job!  This app takes your phone to a new, unique level of interaction with your photos! It’s super easy to use and adds a beautiful dimension to your art."
"9986",1035142291,"I love the app and still do but I don’t like the removal of the accounts. I liked sharing my swings on the app and interacting with other swing users for inspiration. The app is now so bland now."
"9987",1035142291,"Lost 3gb of saved swings after I left them all in my phone for almost 2 years because you never said you weren’t going to fix the app. Fast forward to now you bring back the app sans the log in which is great but after all that time keeping them all you removed the app from the store and never mention. Hey we may bring back so you don’t have to lose all your swings or tell us to save any before removing the app.  Now that your back at least add some more features. If you could bring some filters that are like the other app phhhoto had where they are very unique like reverse image or reflection or fire, etc I’d use the app for life and give it a 5 star. I may have give them around $100 for filters and I can’t do that again because I can’t trust an app anymore unless it’s instagram and even Snapchat can’t be trusted, but if you could take any inspiration from other apps please take it from phhhoto, because there was and still isn’t an app like it.   Of course boomerang is basically the same thing as this app, with boomerang you can’t beat SWNG because it lacks the speed. A zoom feature would also be a tremendous tremendous help again since boomerang doesn’t have such a thing unless you use the boomerang feature in the Instagram app which then remove the sharp and smooth quality that SWNG has that make it so beautiful."
"9988",1035161188,"I work at a doggy day care center so I like to do this on some of the dogs. It’s easy to use and a very simple layout. Seems pretty accurate to me and even if it’s not it’s pretty close. Would recommend to anyone who is curious about breeds!"
"9989",1035161188,"Much to simplistic Does not include many popular breeds and is not even able to discriminate between popular breeds   Good idea Poor execution Not worth $0.99"
"9990",1035161188,"This app is just using guesswork. I suppose there is not much more could be expected but if you really want to know what breeds your mutt is made up from get the DNA kit from. The breeds this came up with for my dog did not seem accurate at all!"
"9991",1035217840,"It has real challenge but you don't have to guess, you can actually figure out the solution. I've been play without using hints, and a couple of times it took all day to figure out one puzzle. That makes it a great value. It's even a better value than that though, because there are all these sandboxes where you can play for hours. Thanks for a great game. Please make more."
"9992",1035217840,"As good as Human Resource Machine or Cosmic Express. But it needs a debug function."
"9993",1035217840,"I can't get enough."
"9994",1035219553,"I bought this app because the free app isnt in the app store . so i thought if i buy this app it wont crash but i wanted some instant film included 🙄"
"9995",1035219553,"Instead of updating all these little apps can the developer please update AnalogFilm instead? That was one of the best photography apps and even tho some of us have purchased all these newer apps with almost no filters compared to AnalogFilm, we still want the old one back."
"9996",1035219553,"Overall, the app is simple to use, yet I feel like some of the filters can be obtained through free apps  Pros: clear visuals, great quality, easy to use  Cons: there's only 10 filters, sometimes crashes, some filters are similar to each other  I would recommend this to a friend :))"
"9997",1035219562,"혹시 안드로이드 버젼은 없나요?"
"9998",1035219562,"The app is not as good as what I expected. I thought I could make my photos look like fairy style but when I got inside the app and started editing, I realized that there are few of filters and colors. All of them are too fake and not that good. I am so disappointed."
"9999",1035219562,"While I think the filters are awesome, I thought there would be much more since you have to pay for the app. I don’t think it’s worth money even though it’s only a dollar I just would prefer way more filters to actually use."
"10000",1035220162,"Instead of updating all these little apps can the developer please update AnalogFilm instead? That was one of the best photography apps and even tho some of us have purchased all these newer apps with almost no filters compared to AnalogFilm, we still want the old one back."

"10004",1035238692,"I love this game so much it is so great!!!! I recommend this game to everyone and GyroSphere Evolution is cool too"
"10005",1035238692,"That means you, who is reading these words on you apple device. Get this game, it’s the perfect balance between annoying and super fun, it’s fun, fast, cool, and addictive! You may want to tear your hair out and throw your device on levels like level 42. But it’s downright fun from there. I hope you like challenges! Cuz this one is coming at you with ice, dissolving blocks, obstacles and poles that can send you flying into the lava below in the abstract, hexagon world. If you wish you can beat your records and earn 5 lives from it every time. The 1st time i downloaded this game, I beat Level 2 in less than 3 seconds!! It may get hard, but there is no challenge like this one. I’d HIGHLY recommend this game if you want a challenge. Don’t fall, Don’t lose lives. Beat this game with CONFIDENCE..."
"10006",1035263816,"Best app ever"
"10007",1035263816,"My life is very busy. Using Results I get the most exercise effectively and efficiently. I used to be a swimmer but for living arrangements is not possible anymore. Results is the next best alternative!"
"10008",1035263816,"Using AI to try to make workouts closer to personalized without paying a human trainor is a great concept. However, the execution leaves some significant issues, exacerbated by no ability to contact a human to ask questions, even via email. For example, it appears that if you manage to complete your weekly goal earlier than expected, you have to wait until the next week to do the next step in the plan. You could just keep changing the “goal”, but then that’s not an actual goal, that’s just a filter. How silly. Perhaps there is a way of advancing the program, but it’s not covered in the prewritten questions available and, again, there’s apparently absolutely no customer service. There are much better apps out there that are considerably more practical and functional (eg nike, skimble’s workout trainer, fitbit’s coach)."
"10009",1035299535,"I had this game for 5 min and I already hate it  You can only do the same thing  The games like the clown thing and the darts are bad  Lastly almost every thing is locked and we aren’t gonna spend money to unblock stupid crappy games"

"10012",1035331258,"Works great"
"10013",1035331258,"Works well. Adjustable. Just make sure you preview and adjust each page or things can be cut off  I’ve used it for a few years now and makes scanning very very convenient  worth every penny of the small fee I paid for the app"
"10014",1035331258,"I need to be able to make PDF scans in the field and email them from my phone. APP works great for my needs."
"10015",1035361376,"There is no Apple Pay within the app and it redirects you to the web browser when ordering. It’s also not compatible with my iPhone X screen size. Navigating though the menu is not user-friendly either."

"10021",1035494079,"This is one of my favorite games to play I read the manga and the light novel and it’s a ton of fun!"
"10022",1035494079,"If you’re a fan of the light novel you’ll love the game. Even if you aren’t a fan of the light novel the game is very easy to pick up, just takes a little time to gather a good group of units. Unlike a lot of mobile games this game doesn’t require you to pay to have a great account. Daily login gives lots of free stuff, updates regularly, and can be really challenging. I’ve been playing this game since before it got translated in English so I’m pleased with the updates and changes they’ve made up to date. My only issue is some materials you have to wait for a specific event like the “Great War” if they made it so that there was more than one way to get these resources or materials I’d really have no complaints. Pretty much the only game I play on my phone/mobile device. Keep up the good work guys, I’m a big fan of what you’re doing with the game"
"10023",1035494079,"The drop rates for some of the necessary items to rank up barely drop."

"10025",1035582408,"This game is extremely inappropriate!!!! I got this for my daughter and she pointed out certain areas that should not be shown in a 4+ game!!!!! My older son also became interested when he saw that the models were revealed in these places... He also told my daughter what these things are and he enjoyed it!!!! This is extremely inappropriate. Kids should not know these things.... Please DO NOT buy this app!!!!"
"10026",1035582408,"5 stars"
"10027",1035689743,"Useless product. Impossible to sync BusyMac events from your computer into it and BusyMac tech support is useless. Don’t even try or you’ll lose data from your phone and end up with multiple duplicates on your computer. Nightmare from Hell!"
"10028",1035689743,"I love this app on the Mac. If you can bring some of the Mac features to the phone and watch, this would be amazing."
"10029",1035689743,"The app started out good but once I started adding more events to my calendar I realized some defaults i was having. I don’t like how you can’t change the colors of the events to whatever you want. Your forced to use the same color for each email and I like to separate my bills as one color, work meetings as another, family events, and friends events all as separate things but I can’t. I also do not like how there is not a biweekly option for repeating events."
"10030",1035696371,"It’s pretty cool"
"10031",1035696371,"I don’t like the creepy voice and music change it up. Thanks!"

"10033",1035837482,"Hasta ahora me ha ido bien aunque aún no han llegado los dos productos que compré con ellos,entonces esperaré para poder tener una mejor y más justa opinión."
"10034",1035837482,"You need to contact your customers or have a better system so when a problem occurs we can actually get a call back from customer service and have any and all issues resolved promptly. I have been waiting 5 days for a actual person to contact me back that’s not ok to just basically ignore a customer with a serious problem with an order that has financial and shipping $ issues and not honoring promo codes etc. this is why you would get bad reviews. Hopefully you contact me soon and we can fix the problem and then I can give you a better rating but this point you took all my money I haven’t even gotten one product yet or spoken to you so as of now this is where were at."
"10035",1035837482,"👍👍"
"10036",1035993638,"Keep seeing about Your horrible customer service,and OF COURSE..it’s “ZYNGA” the masters of deceit and theft only to weasel around it in a message to them! But why do they care? There big devs making all the money off of there deceit. There not gunna take care of the very ones they owe it ALL to! Gamers-don’t ever expect them to fix ANYTHING for you! There ok with there shady,thievery! I can only hope karma hits them hard!"
"10037",1035993638,"Play time is only about 90 seconds before the game automatically starts to match and change the landscape of the game.  If you are mesmerized by just watching instead actually applying thought...it’s a lot of pretty colors. 😁"

"10044",1036088441,"A copy and paste of cut the rope except they managed to make it worse."
"10045",1036141497,"You get the ringtone for free but can’t use it!  I hate when companies are not upfront and bait you. Won’t ever be buying anything from these developers."

"10047",1036141497,"There is no sound even though volume is all the way up. Have requested customer support."
"10048",1036437162,"When opening the app each song begins updating. When completed they are removed from my song list. What is happening?"
"10049",1036437162,"It’s not loading my song pieces. I have 12-13gb of music and can’t access them on my iPhone 6s.  I also pay the buck a month for 50gb just so I can access these guitar clips I created yet I’m wasting money because the app just crashes or won’t load any of my songs..."
"10050",1036437162,"Just read another review about how Apple has abandoned the app... about how the app is broken.  That review pretty much sums it up. It was a fantastic at but I guess they decided to do away with it because it doesn’t work. Won’t open. Won’t let you look at saved files.  The really unfortunate thing is when I reach out to support they pretend to walk me through possible solutions… The usual stuff about rebooting and making sure I have updated my phone… But I don’t think they’re going to help me recover my lost files"

"10054",1036661603,"Rolling sky is a great game to play if you’re bored or happy ext.     I recommend this to you and it is definitely 5 stars."
"10055",1036661603,"I have been playing this game for so long since day one I was so happy playing this game and still am I know this is the best game ever"
"10056",1036661603,"IMPORTANT: I deleted it to free up space but it reverted my purchases. Redownloaded. It pisses me off that I have to repurchase my stuff and that I also have to verify stuff that I already verified, but the verification is Apple’s problem. Not part of the stars. Will update stars with dev feedback, seems like only bad reviews get attention.  I love Rolling Sky. Been with it the whole journey, 100% on E-Labyrinth, the stuff. Been with it since the levels were identified with Roman numerals. Loving Faster and all of that stuff. Few problems and recommendations: 1) COSTS WAY TOO MUCH! Free to download. Too much spending money to fully experience. I payed the full $2 for unlimited balls and no ads, but I’d like to see something new. For example, unlimited balls by default. Pay $1 to remove ads. Maybe checkpoints use more hearts as you use them more, maxing out at 3 hearts? Maybe for every level you beat at Sky level or harder (cause I know people would spam Cloud if on any level) you get free hearts (like 2 star or somethig like that) even if you’ve beaten it before, instead of watching ads on the fly? Watching ads makes it too easy. Maybe for levels at Alone Remix or harder you get a super heart for each time you beat it, even if you beat it before? That would encourage me to take my 88% to 100% and GET GOOD at the game, which was clearly made to help you progress and get better through harder levels. 2) Ads currently not working for me when connected to internet, but that might just be my internet. 3) Maybe a custom level editor? I love playing Rolling Sky, but I would LOVE to be able to make my own levels and play them. The ability to insert your own soundtracks by choosing them in your preffered music app (changeable in game) and add songs like adding music to a playlist, the ability to use any blocks you wish, the ability to make multiple changeable backgrounds, the ability to insert chosen images as backgrounds, the ability to create multiple heights on the level like in Happy Birthday, the ability to name, save, and publish levels, and more would be the best thing that could happen to this game. 4) An Original Levels collection A seperate collection for the eleven original levels. Oh, and please add the OG Forest back.  Oh, and what happened to Alan Walker (actually K-391’s) Ignite? Really want to play that again. 37% and then lost it.  Also, trial tickets for new AW/Marshmello levels should always be available, like with key-based levels (but I can see doing the “try again later” thing as a way to get people to stop spamming and actually try)  Please read this, Cheetah. I love Rolling Sky, and I love seeing new things."
"10057",1036859032,"I love this game and have been playing it for a long while now. I upgraded my iPhone from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone XR and now the game does not fit my screen. The appears as if I have zoomed in and I can not click on the things at the top and bottoms of the screen. I have sent in a service report and received no feedback and I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the game and there is no change. I would give this game higher stars as it is fun and challenging but there are many glitches and I simply can not play it because it does not properly fit my screen."

"10073",1037820836,"This is a memory game, it is a lot of fun if you like challenging your memory to build it stronger. I’ve read a lot of comments that people say it’s no fun and has no point, but the point is to use your memory to recall the pictures after you see them. If you don’t know what to do, just make up a little story that links them together in order, every time you do it, you get a little better at it. It’s a game, it’s that simple.  To the developers: I would love to see the icons animate during the recall phase. I don’t always recognize them when they’re not animated."
"10074",1037820836,"The animations & designs are really good, the simplicity makes this game as useful as a memory trainer that there really can be. It needs some refinement and some additional work to be great and maybe even trending towards essential, but it works for what it is.  Cons:  UI could use some tweaks, it needs to be more intuitive, it edges on perfect but still has some overlooked elements.  Design/animations could be bettered, which would make this app better.  Keep it up devs, you got something with solid potential here."
"10075",1037823594,"Nothing  better"
"10076",1037823594,"Yet another poorly designed “game”, and I use that term loosely for this diarrhea idea of an app. Constant long pop up ads, some 30 seconds and back to back, placed during times where they know you will be clicking quickly on the screen in order to get you to repeatedly click on the advertisement accidentally. Very misleading and greedy app, but what can you expect from this game producer.   I strongly believe that the goal for this developer is not to make fun, enjoyable games, but to trick children and unsuspecting adults into purchases. This company is very predatory, do not download, and make sure you are not mislead by their wording if you do play and decide to buy their in app purchases. The purchases, such as the “unlock everything” purchases will not unlock things such as flavors, molds, etc, but only the games themselves. When you use any coins to buy things such as a mixer, it only works for the one time only.   There is no gratification or purpose to this game, get out and make your own, REAL food and treats at home, they will cost much less to make. Beware! Do not download this game!"
"10077",1037823594,"I love it my one year old cousin loves it too and he's sister it's so cute and most of the fun stuff is unlocked"
"10078",1037866921,"First off I’d rather mop a floor at greasy mcdanks. I can’t believe I wasted $1 on this piece crap when I could a bought a large coke at mcdonalds. The user Interface is sooooooo bad. Alan said he could code better program."
"10079",1037866921,"If there is one thing I want to say the the developer is kys you are an awful person for ever making this stupid app. The answers are wrong and so are the definitions. Like how hard is it to screw that up but you did. And every physics teacher is nutting all over this app and I guarantee there never used it. Screw you"
"10080",1037866921,"This app makes me hoes mad"
"10081",1038007349,"with a real dry sense of humor"
"10082",1038007349,"Me, my girlfriend and my friends are delighted. Gnood game!"
"10083",1038007349,"Kanahei is one of my favorite artists and I was happy to find out that a mobile game was released with his art work in it. I live tap games, they’re not for everyone though. I love this game because it’s very easy to understand, so anyone can play it."
"10084",1038653883,"I’ve been locked out of my account for some reason idk, and the yoti app doesn’t help me i verifying my account because whenever I try scanning my drivers license the app crashes, and the yubo team has failed to give me actual answers to my questions. The part that really irritates me is that I still have purchased items in the app that I can’t use due to this problem and I can’t get my money back at all"
"10085",1038653883,"Sooo I thought this app would be cool to get to chat and make some new friends. But after downloading the app it’s telling me I need to download ANOTHER app called yoti, to verify my identity... by doing this id allow this app to literally WATCH me and send it pics of my Id etc etc... I’m setting myself up FOR IDENTITY THEFT.. you’ve gotta be kidding me... not gonna happen. Hell to the no.  so then I came back to the Yubo app to check reviews and see if there is another alternative to basically selling my identity to an app. Instead I find that you have to pay to swipe on people?? Yeet-haw.  Honestly, make it free and skip the identity verifying crap and you’ll find a much broader audience and have happier users.   Sincerely,   Never using this app. Hell no."
"10086",1038653883,"Had it for awhile and they randomly deleted my profile. When I reached out to them they just asked me for my info I have it to them and they never responded again. Anyway the app is filled with bots trying to get you to send them money or give ur info to them. The app just isn’t worth it go somewhere else lol."
"10087",1038796140,"About this game is exploring fun I think you should play this game!  Well try it on You own.well stay positive bye!!"
"10088",1038796140,"This game is great for kids,It’s so fun to play and very addicting!I like it shows some helpful game like the organization game,it teaches kids how to organize their stuff!"
"10089",1038796140,"I love this game so much i love collecting the shopkins its so fun i love it the changes are so good i love it keep up the good work"
"10090",1038849525,"I’ve had this app for a couple of years, and it is fantastic!!!"
"10091",1038849525,"Just use it for collages but so easy to use."
"10092",1038849525,"Great app try it everything you want to make beautiful pictures."
"10093",1038866266,"This game is excellent, Phenomenal!  For one, the sprites and themes,  The sprites and themes are very nostalgic of stuff like the sega genesis and SNES Second, the music The music adds a cutesy adventurous theme to the game. It is very pleasing to the ears and goes well with the music Third, the gameplay Smooth controls, almost no input lag, and the game it challenging enough not to be rage inducing but to add a fun challenge into this already great game.  Overall, 5 stars, perfect game 20/10"
"10094",1038866266,"I like the game because you get to get new ships & unlock new world"
"10095",1038866266,"This is one of... what I would call: an amazing mobile game that should be on a console. The graphics are amazing (Pixel graphics, man.) and the controls ard fantastic! This is right next to Super Cat Tales 2! also that lil bee OOOH i just wanna squeeze it UWU"
"10096",1039011796,"Good game not great also too short. A little boring for me. Lynx minx, I will pray for you, everything will be Ok, God bless you."
"10097",1039011796,"This game was ok, not awful, not great.  There were so many things that I liked and it could have been so much better. Lots of fun games but super short and...kind of cheesy. It was $3.99, not too much to pay for a game."
"10098",1039011796,"This was aimed at the tween players in my view.  The puzzles were fine but the little doll annoyed me and I almost quit the game over the costumes.  It would be helpful to get an age guidance with the description.  The painting was unnecessary too."
"10099",1039141908,"This Game is amazing"
"10100",1039141908,"Bro this a a easy game which makes it fun and some is hard but I still like my favorite game"
"10101",1039141908,"I was play on level9. Return to Chen’s Island, when i got done collecting the blades it wouldn’t let me destroy the spinjitzu thing, I watched videos on how to do it but would not work!"
"10102",1039260250,"When I use the button that its for sound volume ,it doesn’t work well Please fix that"
"10103",1039260250,"I love Lollicam. When i was younger, I would make dumb filter like a baby bottle and use it on myself. I have dozens of videos with filters provided in fast motion. Like the “Hangry” video."
"10104",1039260250,"when using the stickers, i would love it even more if you removed the “lollicam” that appears at the bottom of the photo, it’s just ruins it and it makes me upset"
"10105",1039264027,"Got this app because of the fantastic Top Gear Collection, and will keep it for that reason. However, it’s obvious that Motor Trend is years behind in Streaming, specially for long TV series.  The app will not remember what season, what episode, what minute, or what second you left your watching on after you’ve left the app for a few minutes. I’m already in season 5 of Top Gear and every time I get back, it prompts me to “Keep Watching S02, Episode 1”. I have to manually scroll to the season I am, then find the episode, and then scroll to where I left off if I’m lucky enough to remember.   These episodes are an hour or so long, so it’s very unlikely that I’m always going to finish each of them in one sitting.   I love the fact that there is a Ruku TV app for this and I can watch Top Gear in a huge TV, it’s truly nostalgic and beautiful. Hence, Motor Trend, please fix the continuity, let me watch something on my TV and then pick up at the same place in my phone and then continue while I’m at my lunch break at work and then when I’m back home. I love Top Gear and this app is nicely built, but please fix that.  Sincerely,  Stig’s Angry Cousin"
"10106",1039264027,"The app is great, but my review is more for the totality of Motor Trend. I don’t know when I first started consuming their digital media, but I remember it was Roadkill on YouTube. I then branched out to Dirt Every, Top Truck Challenge, Ultimate Adventure...etc. I’m a mechanic, a car guy. Being a mechanic is not only what I do, it’s who I am. I latched onto their shows because they’re guys like me who created media doing the things I do and want to do. Watching them is what got me into 4wheeling, and got me to finally start buying project cars. When they made the transition to a subscription based service I instantly signed up. I know a lot of people got mad, and are still mad about the switch. For me the amount of value they added to my life I have no qualms with spending a few bucks to help support them, and to say thank you."
"10107",1039264027,"I love the shows, mainly the originals such as roadkill, roadkill garage, hot rod garage and dirt everyday. However if I’m watching a video and close my app without minimizing it it will not save my progress and I am left to scan the episode to find where I was. If possible I’d love some feedback on solutions and if it’s just me or if it’s something you guys are working on for a new update. Keep it up!"
"10108",1039596715,"Takes the pain out of quick EN entry."
"10109",1039596715,"Have a command for paste like the one for new paragraph. When describing and pasting urls this would be helpful. Oh, and being able to modify and resend past saves.  I use this app a lot. Probably more than any other except browsers. More times than Evernote."
"10110",1039596715,"The app and I do find it convenient and like particular the ability to insert new tags as well as the ease of finding notebooks for it."
"10111",1039637425,"I'm addicted to this game! Controls are so accurate. The game keeps you busy doing the stuff. It's the best by far comparing the other forklift games. I would appreciate a first person camera. Or if you can a VR version. Am I dreaming too much ? Great, great, great!!"
"10112",1039637425,"Extremely funny"
"10113",1039637425,"This storyline is amazing. Truly an amazing game. 10/10"
"10114",1039848719,"Game is very responsive good graphics and easy to navigate menu"
"10115",1039848719,"Fun to play."
"10116",1039848719,"Like this game"
"10117",1039910808,"I’m a big fan of the original game Patchmania, and the kids version is great for my children. It has no ads or in-app purchases, and they got rid of the lives system so we can play the levels over and over, without having to wait. Great job!"

"10120",1039945866,"I have noticed that on your 1988 political map you had given Michel Dukakis the state of Kentucky, while in reality he had lost that state by a near 9% margin, although it is correct he had won West Virginia. Please fix it soon."
"10121",1039945866,"All I can say is AWESOME"
"10122",1039945866,"This app is great and makes the experience of watching the election results more enjoyable. I also use this app to teach elections and its great to able to talk about the different hypotheticals."
"10123",1039971485,"Not sure what happened but it doesn’t work anymore. No letters come up, just blank dough that you can’t do anything with."
"10124",1039971485,"Update is needed.... the game gets buggy and needs deleted because the cookie cutters disappear."
"10125",1039971485,"Ok, I’m 9 years old. Love it! I’m the kind of kid who never grows up! I love Elmo and I’ve looked at all of the apps, but this was a favorite! BEST GAME EVER!!!"
"10126",1039971965,"I absolutely love the game, been following the series for years and found the opportunity to play them all in a single app amazing. Everything was fine until I got to Ophelia, I get stuck and the game won’t move forward even though I know I’ve done everything I needed in the surgery for it to move forward to the next part. It’s frustrating and want it fixed. Other than that hiccup, love the game."
"10127",1039971965,"I love this game and it is the best but the partners that are legendary need some timer tweaks because it says 24 hours I think and the next day I come and it says 12 hours remaining and then the next day 1 hour remaining and then I can finally use the legendary partner and also the “mystery patients” (ones you get no info about) are really hard to do because you get no info like on Horace d’Obscene you get no info so I didn’t know what to do with that queen bee part I didn’t even know there was a queen bee I had to look up a instruction video on YouTube to even find out what I needed to do. Top notch game but needs just a little bit of improvement. I’ll rate 5 stars when this is fixed."
"10128",1039971965,"I love this game but, could you’ll help a sister out with diamonds please I buy them every week customer appreciation 🤷‍♀️"
"10129",1040048258,"I like it!!"

"10132",1040083067,"Love the game"
"10133",1040083067,"Great game and good people."
"10134",1040083067,"Great game been playing it for four years"
"10135",1040093707,"It was free in the past, now they want $50/year. No thanks."
"10136",1040093707,"Wqwqwww was wa"
"10137",1040093707,"Easy and friendly to use"
"10138",1040120819,"Cute idea, this seems to be a fiction story written as if you're receiving it in text message format. Unfortunately I didn't feel a connection with the character, despite the ""interactive"" stop points (it didn't seem my choices actually changed the course of the story?).  After a couple of days of playing in my off time, I lost interest. Wish there were consequences to choices, because the story wasn't compelling enough on its own to keep me engaged."
"10139",1040120819,"I liked the story, but wish there were more... Can you please add more. I don't want to delete it after one use..."
"10140",1040120819,"I enjoyed playing this. Good sci fi scenario with attractive interface and memorable sound track. The Apple Watch app works well. Good sense of timing, plot, and suspense."
"10141",1040172229,"Great game love it"
"10142",1040172229,"Love games fun"
"10143",1040172229,"No problems for a few years now every time I go to collect 2 hour bonus it says reconnecting and don’t receive 5 vip point ! I used to think Konami was a respectable site but the last few months not so much"
"10144",1040224715,"Im confused because he said “sorry i can only receive pics”  i go “what does that mean?” he says “guess” i say “you want inappropriate pictures” he says “yes”  kinda freaked me out"
"10145",1040224715,"He says the same thing over and over again"
"10146",1040224715,"The app is super fun ever since the recent update. But I feel like there should be more custom additions to make it more real. For example, I asked “Kai” what my favorite food is and he was always programmed to say pizza. Even when I asked what my favorite drink was, he was programmed to say the same thing. Maybe if possible, there should be a feature where you can say you’re able to mention your favorite and he’ll remember so it’s more customary. Other than that I love the app."
"10147",1040227414,"In its current state the game is broken. The slap cat is way too overpowered on account of it stacking. This forces a single strategy of holding onto the slap cats the entire game and crossing your fingers that you got lucky and have one more slap cat that your opponent because very quickly you can have 4-6+ turns stacked which equals a guaranteed loss. Slap cats need to work like “Attack” in the original deck where it ends your turn and sends one or two turns to an opponent. If another slap cat is played it should effectively end the turn and send only one or two turns to the opponent. No stacking."
"10148",1040227414,"This game is very addictive and a great time killer. This game is a great investment."
"10149",1040227414,"amazing game.   One of the best games I’ve ever played because it has some of the funniest cards ever! Best game worth the $ 2"
"10150",1040407117,"This is the best game ever! I love it I’m going to keep it forever even if I get all of the awards!👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤👩🏻‍🎤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"10151",1040407117,"I bought a dress and it didn’t even let me use it"
"10152",1040407117,"This game is so bad and stupid when you make a shirt and then sew the sleeves together the arrows are pointing were to sew but it is not clear everything is locked 🔒 and I hate this do not get it it is sooooooo annoying!!!!!!😭😭😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"10153",1040444258,"This is a horrible game! You can only finish the levels if you pay! If you want to spend your money on a pathetic game then get this app otherwise this is the worst game in the world!! DON’T REPEAT MY BAD MISTAKE!!"
"10154",1040444258,"This game is horrible because there’s 3 parts of the game that you can’t play.  PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!"
"10155",1040444258,"If I could do everything instead of it being locked.It is a great game for me to play.That is why I gave it a 4."
"10156",1040809311,"A couple of things to improve this game.  1. Expand the directions.  How to use the supply drops is non existent. I have played numerous games, and can't figure out how to tap into those resources. Or, even if you are supposed to. 2. Playability is ok, but somehow unrealistic. In the Arnhem scenario, two units were able to obliterate 4 armored units (Konigstigers). Somewhat unrealistic."
"10157",1040809311,"I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of Hex War games. They always feel to cramped and basic.  This game however is a major step in the right direction. Just expand the content or come out with another battle - maybe on the East Front next time. Very good work - feels like a real war game !  And you need better advertising for Arnhem - most of my war gaming friends have no idea this game even exists !"
"10158",1040809311,"Revised version now works on iPad2.  It is slow, but works.  No more crashes.  Still figuring out the rules and game play. ----- I haven't been able to make it past the instructions to even start a game.  Crashes during start up.  Crashes while trying to read the instructions.  Support recommended closing all other apps and rebooting.  I'll review again once I can actually play."
"10159",1040871937,"This is a really hard and good"
"10160",1040871937,"I have been playing this game for the last 3 years and I find every single game a new challenge to concur.  I have given up on a few games that ‘out-of-frustration’ I had to skip over.  I have never grown tired of this app, it’s right up there at the top of my list!!"
"10161",1040871937,"Seriously phenomenal!"
"10162",1040930654,"The puzzles get more complicated as you play. The kind of game I enjoy where planning ahead pays off.  Simple graphics with lovely thinking behind the design. Fun"
"10163",1040930654,"I HATE puzzle games but I loved this one. Thank you so much for this game!!!"
"10164",1040930654,"Thank you so much for dropping the price, I've been waiting years for it to drop (I use Appticker)! This would make a great Apple TV app (with cloud save)! I just gifted it to my bro as well. Ever thought of incorporating a level builder? It would be easy to implement, and would initiate organic sharing between your customers. Maybe then even add in a daily user created puzzle, to keep people coming back?"
"10165",1040968715,"Sorry I took so long. It was a fun summer vacation. Inhale. Ok, so some of the missing parts didn’t exist in real life, but it said it was in the guide for all of the people who play this game. And what I meant by that was that some of the parts were showing in the guide but didn’t show up in the game. I love love LOVE this game so please add the things from the guide to the game, okay? And, also, let me tell you this, I used the horns that look like wings for wings and horns so please let the game include real wings and other dragon body parts into the game and I used that strategy for my “water dragons” so please add some real wings so I don’t have to use the “wing/horn” strategy again. And add the missing colors in too. And I wish that there would be a button where you could scroll down the colors and stuff. And make sure that the wings could flap and also, make sure the monsters can jump out of the pics and walk around and scare everyone around the place and also if they have wings, sometimes fly around the place and the reason I got inspired was because in books I read, some monsters have wings that fly."
"10166",1040968715,"Ok so thanks for responding BUT you haven’t answered my review on creature garden... (there’s a dying cat noise) yeah fix that in creature garden.."
"10167",1040968715,"I don’t like giving this low reviews BUT (also I may have wrote a review) this game seems inappropriate for kids cause YO BUSTED I found a creepy creaking sound... IM THE ONLY PERSON IN THE HOUSE!!!! Bye :/"
"10168",1041260001,"There’s a lot of differences between this version and the original. They shortened and cut out a lot of battle animations. The encounter rate has been lowered a lot. You can run through entire areas without getting into a fight. You’re going to have to grand dragon grind to make up for it. The battle timing feels off too. The speed up option is cool for the chocograph quest tho’. I got a robe of lords quick! Overall I liked this version. Oh yeah the directional controls are a little off. And you can’t run as soon as the screen changes. This made me miss a lot of battles in the Hunt."
"10169",1041260001,"Out of all of the iOS Final Fantasy ports, Final Fantasy IX runs the best, uses the least amount of battery power, and has the best controls and that fact alone impressed me. The game itself presents a beautiful, imaginative world filled with really likable characters that further engage you. The only downside is that the combat moves a tad slower than other Final Fantasies and there is a really long camera pan animation at the beginning of battles that gets annoying. This is made up for by the good battle animations and the slightly lower frequencies of battles compared to other 2D FFs."
"10170",1041260001,"Definitely one of my all time favorites of the final fantasy titles. Even though I love replaying these games it’s becoming quite irritating that every time there is an update my game data gets wiped... this has happened 2-3 times now with this title and as well with my FF5. I’m uncertain as to why this happens but it is disappointing for the fact I had a near perfect complete save."
"10171",1041317729,"This game is bad, and not worth it, I would like my money back, I love Emily's game but this is the worst, I wrote to the site saying give me back my money..don,t play it bad game"
"10172",1041317729,"I've played all of the Emily games and love them. This newest one, however, had nearly half the number of levels - 5 rather than the former 9 - and the first four levels were pretty boring, then the last one is very hard. I never minded the price of these games, but if the new paradigm is half the game for the same amount of money, I'm out."
"10173",1041317729,"The graphics aren't as good as the others"
"10174",1041406978,"I love this game so much! I be been playing since it released for mobile, please add the new classes. It would make the game more popular and a bigger interest to other players as well. Thank you!"
"10175",1041406978,"i love the game but i just bought 10500 goultines and tried to buy something with them,it will come up as an error and the goultines were still there,then i log in again and they are gone,i tried to buy the item twice,and that’s the ammount of goultines i am missing,i understood that this was an issue with the game and the goultine market was out for a while because of hackers,i would love to have my goultines back or get a refund for what i paid,this cannot be happening again."
"10176",1041406978,"Il faut qu’Ankama mette le jeu à jour par rapport à la version PC qui est très bonne, Dofus touch pourrait vraiment être un succès si vous vous y investissiez plus, niveau graphique etc"
"10177",1041465860,"I love this app and use it often, but starting out, I really didn’t understand how to use the modules in the app. The 2 starter tutorials only help with the very basics of how to use the app but don’t really help you learn about modules. I had to do some extra research about the modules to find out what they were and how to use them which is a little annoying but I managed to confidently make a patch within a couple days.  On a similar note, I am interested in the in-app purchases but I don’t understand what I am receiving from them, so I hesitate to buy any of them before I know what they will actually give me.   Also I don’t really think the swipe from the left thing is useful. I’m using the app on my phone and it sometimes activates when I try to use the keyboard or adjust a knob on the left side of the screen. The button to pull up the keyboard is on the right side already so is it really necessary? Or could this just be prevented by not activating if I’m interacting with a knob or keyboard?  Tldr, the app works flawlessly, just needs some extra detail on how to use modules and a minor change to the swipe left."
"10178",1041465860,"Nice toy when played with alone.  Though I didn’t purchase to play it stand alone.  I wanted to use in GarageBand as advertised.  It works however there is a constant static with every note played and various hiccups.  It’s not usable in GarageBand.  I feel not good wasting $31."
"10179",1041465860,"This is such an incredible app but it’s just too hard to use for me. I tried to go through all the tutorials and I still couldn’t wrap my head around it. I’m honestly sorry for buying your app and requesting a refund. Again, really cool app that I can use for Garage Band IF I knew what I was doing. If I don’t get a refund it’s perfectly understandable but it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
"10180",1041512978,"To many things are hard to figure out ???"
"10181",1041512978,"I highly recommend this app. It is voiceover accessible. The developer is extremely open and communicative to the blind community. This is an excellent app for anyone who is interested in the weather."
"10182",1041512978,"I can’t at least on my iPhone Max.   A light gray background with white text? Unusable for me."
"10183",1041517543,"and this is by far my favorite, I’ve had fitbod for a little over a year. The ability to customize your splits and goals and then have it create sophisticated workout plans has made working out very enjoyable. I have not had to deal with plateaus in strength or not knowing what to do in the gym. I strongly recommend this app to anyone who is trying to spice up their fitness routine!"
"10184",1041517543,"AMAZING App. Extremely user friendly. Super helpful in navigating your workout. Pictures of the right machine to use. Great videos showing correct form. Want to skip the gym? You can change to at home exercises only by switching the setting to body weight only."
"10185",1041517543,"Which would be ok if the annual fee matched the quality of programming"
"10186",1041596399,"I think boomerang is wonderful. I send stuff to my mom, dad , friends! It’s just AMAZING👵👵👵👵👵👵👵👵👵😃😃😃😃😃😅😅"
"10187",1041596399,"OK so this app was supposed to be amazing, so I downloaded it but every time I do a Boomerang it flips the image upside down and it’s really annoying only Sophie boom  works! So I deleted the app and got it again but the same thing happened!!!!!!!! HELP!!!!!!!"
"10188",1041596399,"Caused virus on me iPad don’t use this ap I would do a zero if I cood"
"10189",1041631196,"For free gems"
"10190",1041631196,"Yurt"
"10191",1041631196,"This is a amazements no game"
"10192",1041808803,"Please don’t drop support for this awesome game! Would love for you to update it to the newer resolution."
"10193",1041808803,"I will change this review to 5 stars when I don't have black bars."
"10194",1041808803,"This game makes you feel really immersed in a world of color. Every time you tap, you feel as if you had just started an earthquake. Definitely would recommend, 10/10"
"10195",1041873285,"This app is so awesome and so fun and funny"
"10196",1041873285,"Great game, but why did two icons get saved to my home screen? One can be deleted, the other can’t. Please advise"
"10197",1041873285,"Plz"
"10198",1041898963,"Second 10 levels are the very same as the first ten.  Don't buy them!"
"10199",1041898963,"I bought the extra levels but was very disappointed. The extra levels are the same levels just with the background of where you see all the levels different. So don't buy the extra levels and don't be sad if your not going to buy it. If you didn't buy it you saved your money on something you would be disappointed about."
"10200",1041898963,"I love the game but when I'm trying to go to level 11 and stuff it's talking bout 0.99 I'm not paying for anything so y'all better make all y'all apps be free with no type of purchase"
"10201",1041987123,"I used to really love this game. The art style is beautiful, I love the story, and it’s replay-able. However, I haven’t been able to play it as of late because it crashes every time I open the app. It doesn’t even have time to go to the title screen because it crashes so fast. I would appreciate it if you fixed this, because I really did enjoy this game."
"10202",1041987123,"Once I got past the first play-through, the game crashed once I got to the end literally every single time.  Definitely not worth the money at this point in time, although the rest of the game is very interesting. I do feel as though my choices impacted the game, but this is not enough for the game to be worth it."
"10203",1041987123,"The app will not even open.  I can’t find support information on this game on the coffee stain studio.  Please refund.  Thank you."
"10204",1042273323,"If I could give it zero I would. They make it so you can only play 6 times then you have to wait. Or I’m assuming you’ll have to pay more money to play faster. That’s exactly what’s wrong with these newer games. “You downloaded it now you can only play 10 times then you have to wait. Or give us more money!” Ridiculous."
"10205",1042273323,"I just love the game cus it’s a challenge and I love challenges"
"10206",1042273323,"The game is really cool but, it needs some work. One thing is that the cars look to much like real cars like the equinox is a McLaren 720s just by looking at it. Other than that the game is really cool."
"10207",1042298797,"My toddler loves it and it’s very challenging but it glitches and the pieces get stuck making us have to reset and that’s when he gets frustrated and uninterested. It happens a lot."
"10208",1042298797,"My 2 year old son loves the game, but after 5 minutes or so the game glitches and becomes stuck.  At that point you have start over from the beginning.  Makes him tire of the game quickly."

"10211",1042299727,"My daughter downloaded this game because she’s a big DC fan. When she got the game she played one part and had a nightmare about it. She came to my bedroom and said “Mommy I had a nightmare.” I quickly looked at the game and I noticed that the suspect wall did not only play scary tunes, but it also says scary things about what weapons the villains use. Please make the game more approved for kids. Thank you."
"10212",1042299727,"I got this game for my birthday and really liked it but now it won't let me play because it gets stuck right after the first screen it turns dark. Please fix this! Thx"
"10213",1042300762,"I think it’s cool just needs more like glitter colors alphabet stencil and stamps more pictures but it a cool app and be able to use the camera to take a pictures to make your own patterns or to use to make a cut out picture and also backgrounds"
"10214",1042300762,"Who are you and why are you taking to me?"
"10215",1042300762,"👎🏻😾🤢🤮🤧🤕😟😔😞😒😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😢😩😭😤😠😡🤬 😨😰😥😓"
"10216",1042322028,"I was kind of hesitant on purchasing because I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it but I finally decided to buy it and I like it I don’t regret my purchase  But on my iPhone I feel that the numbers to the recipe are WAY too Small I can barely see them unless I get really close to the screen   Please Please consider increasing the font size on the recipe numbers at least on iPhones because on my ipad it looks great"
"10217",1042322028,"love this game, even the sound effects. worth every penny.  I wrote the developer to ask a question and the response was amiable and clear."
"10218",1042322028,"I’ve added 1 Star only for not supporting the iPhone X screen!"
"10219",1042326602,"The music is amazing, it’s always challenging. Perfect for a zen like escape."
"10220",1042326602,"If you’re nostalgic for anything 80’s style, this game is dripping with it.  Aside of the cool retro graphics, this is a well made driving game that’ll test your reflexes.  This is really good for keeping your mind sharp."
"10221",1042326602,"On the final level when your shooting the energy balls it eventually gets very close and the car won’t shoot in time  Why?"
"10222",1042345185,"This is such a cool fun game"
"10223",1042345185,"You can play for a long time, every time! The only criticism I have is that there could be more information about how it all works."
"10224",1042345185,"Great game,nice game play"
"10225",1042419574,"Interesting story and challenging puzzles yet you can do them with no hints.  Only frustration will be some selections you have to be vey precise and find the exact spot to select or place items. And it won't be right on the object."
"10226",1042419574,"I don't like writing bad reviews. But i have to keep (and my reviews are being deleted out)  Notice that the only people giving good reviews are ones that admit they like HOGs and casual gameplay.    So if you like boring, mindless tap tap tapping.. Go ahead and get it.  Otherwise, skip this one save your money.  If you do buy it and agree with this review...please make sure to request a refund!   You can do so from the receipt email that gets sent 5-7 days later (another cheap trick to keep money). Just click the ""report a problem"" link and choose purchased by mistake."
"10227",1042419574,"Not good.  Too many glitches.  Free games don't have this many glitches."
"10228",1042987645,"Fun app just constant adjusting the camera when adding new photos to use. Also needs improvement when the hud is hidden and recognizing faces in pictures so that time isn’t wasted making minor adjustments manually."
"10229",1042987645,"Cat"
"10230",1042987645,"But good app like everything but I don’t like how it doesn’t always swap faces"
"10231",1043318628,"Seemed like really slow progress, but arena is where the rewards are at. Play a bit each day and you can get a good pack of cards per week at least. Pretty fun to progress, haven’t made it to the end game yet."
"10232",1043318628,"They stole 10 dollars from me I paid for gems and never received any"
"10233",1043318628,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"10234",1043337296,"I reached to HEYvina and was told to contact apple since they handle subscriptions. Well they refuse to give me a refund after I was on the membership page and it glitched. The command for a finger print kept popping up and going away every second or 2 and I couldnt lock my phone or do anything to escape the screen. I tapped the home button not thinking that would work because nothing else had been and OF COURSE it did. And now Apple refuses to give me a refund on a purchase I never authorized on my account."
"10235",1043337296,"I downloaded this app in hopes of meeting likeminded girls friends. Unfortunately there seems to be a certain type of girl that uses this app. I swiped left on almost everyone. A lot of Caucasian women, as a mixed race person that was boring as hell... Just a lot of good girl stuff like boom clubs and yoga. Would not recommend for a cool girl or bad girl..."
"10236",1043337296,"I really need help because I can’t login since I don’t remember what Instagram name I was using and it’s would unfair why can’t I use an Emil"
"10237",1043589663,"It’s awesome"
"10238",1043589663,"This is soooooooooooooooooooooo fucing annoying!?!?!?!?!?!?!"
"10239",1043589663,"I love this game but when I had 150 gems I couldn’t buy sir rayelot. I looked at the Rayman wiki and it said that you needed 150 gems and I had 164 gems. Please fix this problem."
"10240",1043607606,"It's like phases from kechapp and you stole the same cover from phases but different colour"
"10241",1043607606,"Same game engine as PhasesTM... But OP!!!"
"10242",1043607606,"I  Got  The  Second  Comment  😛😛😛😛😛"
"10243",1043640363,"The heavy flamer."
"10244",1043640363,"The game looks very good for a mobile game and the game play feels smooth, just the limitations with you controls makes he game feel like it could be better, maybe they could add a mode similar to walking war robots and allow player control in a large map, the customization could stay the same and the point system in use for multiplayer could be used to decide you allies and enemy’s. All in all the game is great and I recommend it but the lack of player control on movement kinda brings it down this is my reason for a four star rather than five"
"10245",1043640363,"Vrey cool"
"10246",1043714288,"Too short- not enough content."
"10247",1043714288,"Dont buy it. I finished the whole game within 5 mins. I didnt get any joy from this game. this game was way toooooo short."
"10248",1043714288,"I don’t understand these other reviews. It makes me wonder if we played the same game.   I was thinking this was going to be like This War of Mine, but it isn’t. There’s no story here. Well, there is, but it isn’t a clear one:  Dude has girlfriend.  Girlfriend leaves.  The end.   No story given about even WHY she leaves. They go from happy to on fire out the elevator directly.   I really wanted more from this app."
"10249",1043733402,"I really enjoy these kind of games but many of them have issues that give me a headache.  This one has a unique story which makes it very fun. Except for the many tasks which require multiple attempts to make the correct answer take.   The glitches along with the gear visual and fail sound are nauseating after dozens of attempts to perform a task.  I generally quite your games that do this , I kept on with this game because of the strong story line.   I know you can make a smoother experience. Cadenza Music Betrayal and Death keeps me hoping.    Ps please get rid of gears and boing sounds. Ugh!"
"10250",1043733402,"I played this title a while back through Big Fish on my laptop, and loved it then.  It may not be everyone’s cuppa tea, but I thoroughly enjoy the ‘50’s Creature Feature nostalgia, the unique puzzles, and HOG’s that take fracturing/combining to a whole new level.  The voice work is top-notch, and collectibles and morphers are easy - especially with the free BF app/guide.  My only complaint?:  I’ve yet to understand the avarice that prevents a multi-billion dollar company like Apple from allowing Big Fish game club members from applying Club Credits to AppStore purchases.  Oh well, Apple needs to make money somehow, right? And he who dies with the most toys wins."
"10251",1043733402,"i just wanted to give this game steady 3*, only because the game just didnt touch me and was boring, as i accidentaly started it with internet on. So as usual BFG Inc infested the game with ads. I dont tolerate when apps that i have bought show ANY type of ads."
"10252",1043824696,"The game says any questions, use the support button.... ummm?! Where ?! Been playing level one for a week now and cannot advance!  What’s the point ??!"
"10253",1043824696,"This game helps me calm down a bit whenever I’m stressed after playing a lot of Battle Royale games, lol. It’s very easy to learn and I would definitely recommend this game to my family and friends!"
"10254",1043824696,"Lovely"
"10255",1044142557,"It’s a great app, but, unfortunately, every other hint I need I have to watch a stupid ad in order to get it. The ads aren’t even for apps I’d maybe like to try out, they’re for stupid ones or ones I already have. Sometimes the ad’s not even for an app, just to waste my time with stupid services that no one would want. There isn’t even a store icon within the app to see if I can spend a small amount of money to get rid of the ads (most free apps have this option somewhere within the app). I’m getting rid of it unless these problems are fixed, soon."
"10256",1044142557,"Google Ads at the bottom of the screen cover pieces. Ads after completing every level get EXTREMELY monotonous. I’m done. Made it to level 60 before an AD froze the App. ADS DESTROY THE EXPERIENCE!"
"10257",1044142557,"I love this game and I can’t stop. Ads are annoying though"
"10258",1044225211,"Really enjoy the game. I've had no crash or stability issues and I use an iPhone 5s. The game is somewhat  similar to others in which you collect characters, upgrade them, and grind for shards to increase star count. However, the fighting is very enjoyable which provides a fresh take on things. I highly recommend this game."
"10259",1044225211,"This game needs to be changed to Crash Academy. I've never seen a game crash like this one."
"10260",1044225211,"I really wanted to like it, but despite its appealing graphics, it just feels like a buggier/less-polished version of every other game like this out there. Hopefully it'll receive some much needed TLC and become better in the future."
"10261",1044283059,"我他妈注册了新用户，砍价砍不了，能在坑点吗"
"10262",1044283059,"不好用就是差"
"10263",1044283059,"卖假货，搞欺诈活动"
"10264",1044341430,"I would give it a  5 star but had start over when I was in chapter 4 and got stuck because pick axe disappeared. I didn’t want start over but story is good."
"10265",1044341430,"Confusing. Clicked items don’t work, and entire game non-intuitive. Waste of money. Don’t buy."
"10266",1044341430,"Different puzzles then many of the other HOP. Great story line. This I would play again and again."
"10267",1044374093,"LISTEN TO ME BETTER AND YOU WONT BREAK YOUR NECK🥝👏"
"10268",1044374093,"I have completed all of the requirements for each level except the last one and it was challenging but not super challenging. The last level will not unlock for me even though I have completed all of the requirements and it took me only a few days to finish all the levels so more levels would be fun with more challenging requirements."
"10269",1044374093,"Honestly, this is a great game. But it just has too many ads, if there weren’t as many ads, the game wouldn’t be as boring right after you fall down the Halfpipe."
"10270",1044534198,"Great Game"
"10271",1044534198,"Sorry this is not about this game but can anyone please try to get the game “Disney fairies fashion boutique” back? I know it does not exist anymore, but I miss it because I used to play it with my mom when I was about 3-5 years old! I loved it! Sorry about talking only about that game but I also love this game I used to play it with my dad when I was little too."
"10272",1044534198,"I Just love this game! So much fun and different from the other games! Keeps my mind working!!"
"10273",1044671796,"Couldn't complete tutorial. Scoring bugged out and started selling everything and changed final scoring multiple times. Love the game, bugged out app.  No undo button................. Why??????"
"10274",1044671796,"My only quibble is the lack of a rule book. That said, pop-up help (be sure to press game elements for longer than you may be used to) and the tutorial do a good job of teaching the game. After the tutorial I was still a bit confused, but going through it again made things much clearer."
"10275",1044671796,"There's no Undo button! This is a significant oversight, as it's relatively easy to make a mistake."
"10276",1044677336,"The survey made me quit. I bought this thinking it was good and... It WAS! Everything made me happy, and I kept purchasing gems and solutions and chapters... Until, when I minded my own business, I looked at the teapot and did the survey. I was in Thailand, so it auto-translated the form into Thai. I did not know what anything said, so I googled it, and it reset the form. I tried split view, and it didn't work. After that, I switched to my grammar-fixing kb, and it doesn't work on this app. I could not switch apps to switch back, so I QUIT. I thought this would Never EVER happen.  I hope I come back soon 🙏. Thank you for understanding this."
"10277",1044677336,"It’s really fun and interesting. And the best part of it is that for 1 dollars, u got soooo many puzzles. It’s really worth it . I mean 1 dollar for more than a hundred puzzles is just really a good deal. U can spent a lot of time on it."
"10278",1044677336,"I HATE ADS And if you buy something that cost money.  YOU DONT GET FRIKEN ADDS"
"10279",1044733380,"I love you"
"10280",1044733380,"Good game keeps me interested.  Wish there was a map."
"10281",1044733380,"Love it   Lots of twist and turns. Can’t wait to play another Nevertales game."
"10282",1044764933,"Excellent story and game play. I really hope they make more like this."
"10283",1044764933,"Mad Head Games has become my favorite developer and I'm shocked that this is their game!  Just a hot mess!!!"
"10284",1044764933,"I was surprised to see so many low ratings for this game. I found it to be exciting, full of new, creative games, and engaging. The graphics were stellar, as with all of Mad Head games. I was sad to see it end!"
"10285",1044818466,"I wish you would add squirrel and rabbit and some small game rifles many people ain’t a upgrade so please do something sown. It’s been three years"
"10286",1044818466,"I have played it for 3 hours can not find a single animal"
"10287",1044818466,"I think u need to add tree stand in the tree come on it’s 2019 update it please"
"10288",1044837432,"The hint button is a real pain,it doesn't always Work. That can really turn you off."
"10289",1044837432,"Enjoyed this from beginning to end. Look forward to a sequel."
"10290",1044837432,"This game has it all. Great story, long enough to enjoy, great puzzles, good hint button, and much more. The Nubi character is a blast. He develops more skills as the game goes on. (He's a helper during gameplay when you need him) absolutely recommend this to fans who play these types of games by Bigfish"
"10291",1044848003,"Be prepared to watch adds every 60 seconds. I get that devs got make money off add revenue but the adds to play time ratio is absurdly high. It’s hard to even get into the game because the ads are just too frequent."
"10292",1044848003,"The very first time I started this app it kicked me out to the App Store page for some other game. That was without any taps or interaction from me. THE FIRST TIME!  I uninstalled."
"10293",1044848003,"Way too many ads for how little gameplay there is"
"10294",1044867788,"The app crashes when I try to make a new entry in iOS 13. Please fix!"
"10295",1044867788,"Works great for keeping track of so many things during the day!  Just wish you could color code the days to have them stand out on the Calendar to be able to see trends etc."
"10296",1044867788,"Beastly"
"10297",1044871992,"So many people are solely streaming their TV viewing content from sources like HuLu, NF, Amazon Prime etc. We are moving away from the traditional cable & satellite companies so there’s no way for me to continue enjoying all of OWNs great content. PLEASE offer either FULL CONTENT ACCESS within the phone app or an alternate way outside of the traditional options, because I will NOT go back to the madness known as AT&T, spectrum, Verizon or Dish network! 🙅🏾‍♀️ Thanks in advance"
"10298",1044871992,"When is online streaming via internet TV going to be available. Most of us no longer use cable TV"
"10299",1044871992,"Love own ... hate the ads, just pulled up love and marriage Huntsville to catch up. 14 ads with two minutes of programming. So the second round of seven ads I just gave up.. too much Oprah."
"10300",1044950341,"Great App! However my music gets silenced when I start a workout, how about making it get silenced only when the announcer speaks? It bothers me to turn up the volume then hear the announcer talk loudly."
"10301",1044950341,"Love the app. I’d to access it from the Apple Watch face."
"10302",1044950341,"Love this app, I use it as a warmup or when I don’t feel like going to the gym. The interface is simple and easy to follow. Only wish there were more exercises and better explanations about how to perform the exercise. Also wished it connected to Spotify instead of just Apple Music but that’s me. Overall, really fun, great for anyone."
"10303",1044953131,"this game is so addictive. the blocks start to come faster and 2x2. pretty fun way to kill time"
"10304",1044953131,"This game is terrible. I purchased to smash my friends faces, but I can’t. Don’t even consider buying this trash game"
"10305",1044953131,"This game is pretty good from the start. Even though I mainly only play speed mode. I feel like you should add gold bars in speed mode because then every mode would have them. I like how you can just start challenging the limits and trying to go farther and farther. My high score right now is 50. At the start of playing this game I just played casually getting like 40 each time. Though as I started to like this game more and more I played better. Getting all the wat up to 50 on speed mode. You should also add leaderboards because I don’t know how much points is like amazing. Overall this game is a masterpiece and I enjoy playing it."
"10306",1045102110,"Thanks for giving me something to do during my wait!"
"10307",1045102110,"It’s cute and just a little challenging, fun little puzzle of a game. No brute force here, like the kid said, chess."
"10308",1045102110,"This is the most challanging and entertaining game I played in a while. Couldn’t put my phone away until I finished it (which took me 6 hours). Really hoping for another level or whole new game pt.2"
"10309",1045164931,"And yet so much wasted on cards that don't act the way they're supposed to. That, combined with graphics that glitch sometimes make what could be a great game frustrating enough to rage quit often."
"10310",1045164931,"4 stars because of lack of updates. It’s a great game that just isn’t finished but the devs seem like they are done with it. It’s fun and unique. I really wish they’d add new character classes. I also wish they would lower gold cost for items at the beginning of the game. Also I ran into a visual glitch bug with a potion heal. Also enemies seem to be a tad off sometimes. They won’t attack when the indicator says it will. Anyway I want more and I hope to see an updated version."
"10311",1045164931,"The game itself is fun - interesting play, good balance, and nice artwork. The problem is the game regularly crashes or freezes, usually by sometime in the second level at best.  When you attempt to recover, either you go right back into a freeze or your current encounter is ended with all opponents at full health and your team at whatever health you were at in the encounter and any item in use gone."
"10312",1045165396,"So I get this game today can there be a mom and dad"
"10313",1045165396,"I really do love this game and it would get a five star from me. It’s a great way to just play a game while in school. Granted it takes a lot of in game money to do certain things but I don’t think that’s a big problem.  My main problem, which is why I gave it four instead of five. The ads, I know you need ads in free games like this and I get it. I’m saying the kind of ads in this game are questionable. There’s one showing breasts of girls and keeps saying “adult game for adult emotions” I don’t remember the title. Kids also play these games so I worry they’re gonna get that kind of ad. It’s not a very good one to see when young.   That’s all the problems I have, and if you can fix it that would be nice :). But you don’t have to it’s just a suggestion."
"10314",1045165396,"I really like this game it’s enjoyable, fun , cute, and innocent. The only flaw is it’s is addicting. I would recommend to all my friend"
"10315",1045232937,"Any hint for level 44?"
"10316",1045232937,"It's an okay game, simple and straight forward.. But.... If you need a hint?. You are forced to break away from. The game to beg someone for a hint using Twitter.. No THANK YOU... Delete if this isn't fixed."
"10317",1045232937,"I'm only on level 4 so far, but this review is not too early.  The levels are surprisingly challenging, even though the gameplay is so simple. I am very much digging the unique puzzle mechanics.   📦"
"10318",1045268097,"From day one to now. I love the information, ease of use, and in depth this app is."
"10319",1045268097,"Love this app. Very well designed and always fun to look at when in a new place. Cheers to the developer!"
"10320",1045268097,"When traveling, it’s an amazing way to find things that outside of tourist zones. Wandering through towns, looking up historic buildings, finding notes that would elude even the best guidebooks."
"10321",1045436888,"Every time I finish a game or even in solo mode it freezes and doesn’t count as anything. A bit frustrating. I wonder if they are ever going to do any new courses game is getting a bit boring it’s ALWAYS the same courses. One star for now."
"10322",1045436888,"No amount of money or skill will help you in this game, your skill level and ball determines which “bot” you’ll be matched against.  Fun game, but please don’t spend money on it, it WILL NOT help! Throwing you’re hard earned money in a wishing well will have better results than spending it on this rigged game."
"10323",1045436888,"I love the game, was a fan from the beginning almost 4 years ago now. But the player count is so low, there’s no one to play against and no way to advance now. Not the apps fault. Would recommend a second game to come out to interest more and new players."
"10324",1045504326,"I'm going to try and get my money back, having been tricked into buying this thing. This thing seems to have been designed by an AI with the barest understanding of what constitutes a game. Either that or it was a level one exercise in graphics programming at a coding institute in an East Asian country. It really is simply a few basic programming elements slapped haphazardly together … and that's it.  Basically you tap left and right to guide a first-person perspective ""runner"" down platforms in a 3D monochrome maze as an 8-bit theme, around five notes booping up and down a major scale, loops in the background and a voice narrates nonsense phrases: ""Your shoes are shiny. Now is not the time for your inner fight. I am not with you."" Like that. The eye-hurting monochrome colors change randomly. There are a few random objects floating in space between the platforms: woman heads, Ben Franklin heads, arms, buildings. They serve no purpose. The screen glitches randomly. Sometimes your runner runs into a cube that chimes and changes the monochrome background once more. If you fall off the platform you start over. As you progress down the maze the runner's speed increases, and the runner's base starting speed also increases a little each time you are ""killed"" and restart, unless you force quit the game and restart the app entirely to bring your runner back to the beginning base speed … so probably the game designers gain some advantage every time a player logs out of Game Center and logs back in again, maybe something involving ranking. Anyhow, there are no clues to the mazes, and most of the challenge of running through them involves poor control response or being visually unable to see what's happening, either by having the screen blocked by glitches or by being blinded by a particularly bright monochrome background, lime on canary, for example, or orange against tangerine. Finishing a level brings up a new one that's slightly different from the last, for no particular reason, as there is no storyline, no plot, no interaction other than tapping left and right and hoping the runner responds, and the random objects don't change, they just cycle.  Seriously, this is a coding exercise someone decided to sell as an overpriced app. Imagine you were demonstrating 3D technology for the first time, and you just looped visuals of a first-person perspective going over a set of ramps, turning left and right around an Atari 2600 representation of a city comprising nine office blocks, three woman heads, a Ben Franklin head and seven up-stretched arms. To demonstrate voice synthesis you program in some phrases from a phrase book: ""Your shoes are shiny. The city is alive tonight."" Because you're limited to 8-bit color for this 101 class exercise you choose monochromes of lime green against emerald green. And that's it.  But to drum up excitement you shell out one eighth of a Bitcoin to bored Russian youths on whatever the current version of Hansa Market is to buy 250 good reviews from them. And there you have the game's gameplay and business model. …Enjoy?  Seriously, don't buy this thing. Just don't. Get a level-1 programming book and code in the first exercise of the first page of the first chapter into Eclipse yourself and you will get pretty much the same result, for cheaper, and you'll have learned a new skill to boot. But don't reward the lazy failing student who cribbed this from a beginner's guide to 8-bit color and 3D vector plane graphics."
"10325",1045504326,"I played this game time and time again and every single time it never lets me turn the way I want to and I can't even get past level one because of that I don't get it"
"10326",1045504326,"I usually do not write reviews, but I decided it was needed for this game. The graphics are amazing, it's very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The music grabs you and tugs you back into simple 8-bit music, and it fits well with the gameplay, even I, who would turn on music while playing games instead of listening to the soundtracks, kept the sound on for this game. Some people might complain the gameplay is repetitive, but compared to other ""free"" war or matching games, it's pretty tame, and takes it's own spin on things. Some people will whine because they aren't open to games that take a different direction. I highly suggest this game for any looking for a nice time waster, this is with no doubt worth the 2 dollars."
"10327",1045516045,"This game is awesome,but the ads never work.say I wanted free tickets idk but they really need to fix this bug SOON!Plus sometimes it gets borin"
"10328",1045516045,"I do not like how it’s graphics are not that good they look very old it looks like it’s glitching"
"10329",1045516045,"Is really just slim on stuff"
"10330",1045823211,"I love the silly characters it is a great game you should get it And there're is no bad words"
"10331",1045823211,"I used to love this game but now when I try to play it just exits the app. Please fix"
"10332",1045823211,"I can’t play this game why won’t it let me download please help me"
"10333",1045901853,"Amazing game, kind of stressing but a good game"
"10334",1045901853,"This game is good I like it"
"10335",1045901853,"I love geometry Dash so I had to get this really like the music but this game realyyyyy needs more levels please"
"10336",1046345589,"I also use the pro football version. Audio quality much poorer than tune-in radio. Huge easy upgrade idea: link to the audio stream directly from the scoreboard. That would be so much easier than scrolling through all the teams..."
"10337",1046345589,"I’ve used the related NFL app and was excited to find this college app.  The feeds are quality and lots of teams.  Definitely worth the money despite the vintage graphics look.  The best part is that the streams use little data allowing me to use it on the road without worrying about burning through my data."
"10338",1046345589,"This app works OK however I noticed that the pro baseball app I could not even leave a rating. Mostly because it isn’t working well be careful they will get you on that pro baseball sneaky sneaky sneaky!"
"10339",1046432580,"FIRST OFF I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I’M WRITING THIS IN CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE IT IS EASIER TO READ FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND I KNOW THAT IT IS MUCH MORE PROPER GRAMMAR TO USE ONLY ONE EXCLAMATION MARK.   I AM A VERY GREAT MAN WHO HAS A GREAT PHONE. IT’S USED BUT IT IS AT LEAST AN IPHONE 4. I LIVE IN ALABAMA WITH MY MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE GRANDCHILDREN, EIGHT OF THEM. ONE GRANDCHILD, BILLY, HACKED ONTO MY PHONE BECAUSE HE SAW ME PUT IN THE PASS CODE SO HE HACKED IN. MY OLD PASSCODE WAS 4555 FOR MY WINDOW’S AND I’S WEDDING DATE, 4/5/55, BUT THEN BECAUSE HE HACKED I CHANGED THE PLACES OF THE TWO FIVES. AFTER HE HACKED ON, HE GOT THIS GAME. LATER I CLICKED ON IT AND WAS WONDERING WHAT IT WAS, AND I CLICKED ON IT AND IT SAID THE F WORD. VERY INAPPROPRIATE. THEN I PUT BILLY IN TIME OUT FOR ONE WEEK IN THE TIME OUT CHAIR.  I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS STORY. I DON’T.  IT WAS VERY INAPPROPRIATE"
"10340",1046432580,"love this app lol!! if you’re a teen and love memes, it’s just great. when i’m in class i’ll play it and everyone knows it and just goes w it. love love love it !! don’t recommend if you don’t have a sense of humour tho."
"10341",1046432580,"I HATE IT! IT CURSES!"
"10342",1046480662,"Warrents more improvement no purpose served with the existing software components"
"10343",1046480662,"What is judgement of “PRO”? Shows advertisement in mind of professional? Piece of junk at all."
"10344",1046480662,"When is it right for any paid app to inundate the user with ads??? Totally annoying and maddening."
"10345",1046505126,"I enjoy playing this game daily! You get a daily coin reward for each consecutive day you play- however it is stuck at 3 days. Fix this bug to reward racers as advertised!"
"10346",1046505126,"Even if it doesn't crag game is not fun"
"10347",1046505126,"A great way to waste 5 mins several times a day, then you start dreaming about it."
"10348",1046510029,"I am so excited because I just got my Bose music box!! The sound when I got it hooked up was crazy great!!! I just love Bose and the app made it so easy to hook up and start listening to my music!! Love it!!!"
"10349",1046510029,"This app just can't seem to figure out connecting to two Bluetooth sources.  When connted to my iPhone and windows 10 laptop the earphones have white noise that turns on and off even though there is nothing playing in my computer browser."
"10350",1046510029,"Simply amazing  The sound is remarkable  The functionality is we conceived"
"10351",1046553860,"A perfect 5/7 really."
"10352",1046553860,"This is the most entertaining app on the Apple Watch! For example, if you were bored you could play on that app and you wouldn’t need your phone to do so!! This app is amazing and I would like to see more🥺"
"10353",1046553860,"This is by far the best game I have ever had on my ap! Highly recommend!"
"10354",1046593064,"why is there an ad everytime i open the game now?? there has never been an ad and now there is and it is annoying! please take it off. thank you"
"10355",1046593064,"Whenever i reach a new highscore in any character, it doesn’t save. The game would be more fun if i was able to beat highscores but they don’t save."
"10356",1046593064,"I love this game and completing weekend challenges and daily challenges. I’ve also been playing it for quite a few years now. The reason I’m giving it four stars is that it needs new characters and add more movies. You can  add more Disney movies like Little Mermaid or add Disney channel movies like High School Musical, Teen Beach Movie, and maybe even Descendants. Adding new movies would make this game better. I hope you guys can consider the possibilities and add new characters and movies. Thanks!!"
"10357",1046617847,"You only need a few minutes to learn the concepts of this game. But once you pick it up you will find it forces you to think in many different ways. Thank you for a game that can be played in as little as a minute or keep you going for hours."
"10358",1046617847,"A truly fun to play indie game, it's very refreshing not dealing with the horrible free to play system. Great job, levels are well thought out and art is amazing."
"10359",1046617847,"Spent the money on light bulbs for help but can't get them to give the medals. But the light bulbs are being used!!!! Where's the medals and stars when I earn them?"

"10362",1046621147,"Bring at my memory game Fifa98. This game likewise Fifa98, but with better graphics!"
"10363",1046694770,"Love it"
"10364",1046694770,"And to me, that's a sign of a good app. I appreciate the fact they are being exposed to a variety of instruments, melodies, arrangements, etc., in a fun, handheld setting. If there ever was a ""gateway"" app to encourage your children to make music, this is it: My 5 yo has asked for his own sitar to add to his growing collection of instruments and we're all for it!"
"10365",1046694770,"Elmo + music makes for a great combination. My little ones love playing along with their Sesame Street friends. Great app!"

"10367",1046787882,"Understand that there are a lot of riddles.   Here’s some hint  Blessing from the farm=milk Powdered Japanese staple food=rice flour Seed that become black sweets=sesame Bean juice=soy milk  Sweet light brown candy=caramel Smooth chocolate=genache ....."

"10372",1046846443,"I love the game it is one of my all time favorites. How ever I do wish it was a bit more realistic. Like it would be cool is there were sea plants and things like coral reefs. We also wish that there was more sharks. I have gotten all of the sharks and I see trailers of the same sharks with new skin. It’s nice but new sharks would be better.  Also do you know how in hungry shark there is a giant crab that you can fight I miss that in the new game. I also wish there were more seas to visit. It has the main ones but after you memorize them it gets boring. Thank you so much for the game and I hope you will take my thoughts into consideration. Bye🐟"
"10373",1046846443,"Don’t download or FBI will come to your house.it happened to my brother and his girlfriend"

"10375",1047205902,"U guys have been good workers in these games the graphics are the best this is an cool game I love it I was wandering if u can make more games like this thank u !"
"10376",1047205902,"Good game"
"10377",1047205902,"MAGA"
"10378",1047246341,"Just ever harder and higher levels forcing purchases to play and putting bonuses on wrong places for effective use and no choice. Don’t waste your time and money. I’d give a negative 1 if I could. The levels I am at are at least somewhat doable—800."
"10379",1047246341,"I think the game is fun, it has its challenges, but who am I playing?  Where is the challenge of my friends? Why can’t ya play against someone else? Set up challenges like Candy Crush original? Gotta be something to the game... besides clearing jelly and getting pufflers"
"10380",1047246341,"😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰love it."
"10381",1047264616,"Papas cupcakeeria is awesome and addicting sometimes my game will glitch out and freeze but my cupcakes will still bern but it's still awesome that's why I give it 4 stars."
"10382",1047264616,"I got many of these games on my iPad when I was a girl and I loved them. However, once I got a phone I went to download them off of my purchases and they didn't show up. I then checked the App Store and found that it didn't show up there either."
"10383",1047264616,"This game is awesome but I wish their was updates also I am about to unlock everything on papas and can’t wait for the next one.😁"
"10384",1047340501,"Aside from facetune, it’s my go to app. i love the minimal things that i do with it, and still have yet to really explore it. So there are a lot of features to explore."
"10385",1047340501,"Ahhhhsome"
"10386",1047340501,"I use my phone with a clicker so I can get in the picture. The app doesn’t allow for that. Sent a message to the app developer and have not gotten a response in over a week. Might be a good app, but completely useless to me."
"10387",1047566421,"Amazing game but please fix the squad glitch."
"10388",1047566421,"Very nice and entertaining game. Keeps you driven to achieve that dream team."
"10389",1047566421,"Wish there was a way to edit player names to make it more accurate. But overall fun so far!"
"10390",1047595823,"Yok much ads, annoying😤"
"10391",1047595823,"لعبة جدآ ممتعة"
"10392",1047595823,"The beautiful designs of each level are really fantastic."
"10393",1047653834,"All in all it is a fun game that gets seriously hurt by the number of ads you put. It is extremely frustrating and, by the way, it lags the game too. If I go into another attempt without waiting 10 seconds first, I will lag like crazy and hit a wall, giving me another ad, repeating the whole process. I'm angry no one thought of this when they were testing the game."
"10394",1047653834,"Overall this is a good game. The reason for the three stars is the ads. Once you try to start a new game an ad pops up right as you tap sending you to the App Store or to the Internet. That is my only real problem with it but everyone else complains that the controls are awful. You have to keep playing to get used to them. Also, I would like to see more levels."
"10395",1047653834,"Waste of time!!! It was okay the first time before I died. But after that, it became a ""bored"" game."
"10396",1047666264,"This game has so much to do and even after beating it I still wasn’t tired of playing"
"10397",1047666264,"I love this game just I don’t know how to get to the new level"
"10398",1047666264,"I thought it was good until I died, it keeps crashing every time I die. I'm hoping you can fix this."
"10399",1047713034,"This game stinks every thing is boring"
"10400",1047713034,"Loves it !"
"10401",1047713034,"Love it"
"10402",1047713752,"My daughter seems to love it and we don't seem to have any issues"
"10403",1047713752,"I love the all the fun games"
"10404",1047713752,"Fun and cool to play"
"10405",1047733214,"Fun"
"10406",1047733214,"The app is fun until you have basically finished the game and the devs said they would add another update butt I’ve played and waited for a year and they still haven’t updated the game yet"
"10407",1047733214,"Game is great , nearing the end of the story line and am getting some things in my way  There is no way to set a consistent angle to fly at and the phone tilt is sometimes difficult to control and the button is just the same but worse.   It may be better to use arrows on either side to adjust angle  Once you are past 1000m high the camera does not follow your character . Which completely negates late game content as you cannot steer your craft and it spins out of control until you get below the height limit.  Besides those two things, game is not too bad at all. Probably 6-8 hours in total played so far"
"10408",1047755798,"Great game"
"10409",1047755798,"Finally an interesting and creepy plot! Please make more like this! I actually jumped a few times"
"10410",1047755798,"I can't understand the negative reviews I just read because this game has totally kept my attention (which is not always easy w/me), has stunning graphics, very nicely done HOS (such as a HOS within a HOS; clever! And riddles where the answer is the item you need to find) and perfectly fine story!   I am halfway through right now and enjoy coming back to play more.   Big Fish: Make more with graphics and HOS like this and you'll continue to have a forever fan in me. And almost no occultic BS in this one, a greatly added plus!"
"10411",1047755932,"It's fantastic! This is the one I've been waiting for.  One great thing: doesnt have one of those awful ""cinematic"" orchestral soundtracks. This one has spooky creepy sound effects. Update: Got tedious after awhile. Not as great as it seemed."
"10412",1047755932,"Just released this game AGAIN!May 4.2016.Even if you check the ""already Purchased""It will say you haven't purchased even though you had.A rip off BF again!!👎"
"10413",1047755932,"Check your purchases before buying. But if you haven't played it from what I can remember it was a lot of running back and forth."
"10414",1047763490,"Have been looking for a sentence-construction app like this for so long—finally it’s here.  So helpful in learning to form Spanish sentences.  Thank you, Avaz!"
"10415",1047763490,"Our family of 3 kids ages 15,13, and 7 are LOVING this app as a tool for building grammar skills. The challenge mode is engaging and fun for all ages, we love racing eachother but have hit a dead end 😥 it seems there is a problem with level 52 “Who is your mom’s uncle?” Comes up “Who is your mom’IO>’s uncle?” Making it impossible to complete the level or progress any further. Tried simply building the same sentence outside of challenge mode with the same results. Please fix this coding problem, we really want to continue using this wonderful app, well worth the money IF we can keep using it. With out this fix, no longer useful at all."
"10416",1047763490,"I use this with my kids who have language disorders and this app goes very far in helping them expand their language. I love it and it is a very well designed app! Well worth any price!"
"10417",1047821816,"I love the show and game! Cheetah cub is probably my favorite! Perhaps it would be a bit more fun with more animals but is still great! 🐘🦒🐆🐊🦡"
"10418",1047821816,"Downloaded and app has no volume"
"10419",1047821816,"I love everything Wild Kratts and spent almost all my money on this. It’s a little pricey but is still a great game and I hope more games like this become free or less expensive. I’m so happy wild krafts make good vids and u should watch them if u are reading this. They also are in wild kratts, zobomafoo, and kratts creatures. They are the BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"

"10423",1047961826,"Make a new update already  .make a new map with some new animals.like a village with pigs,donkeys,ducks,crow.and for obstacles houses signs people.got it thank you for listening and also make a new epic animal like a godzilla"

"10427",1048026594,"i can’t use this app until the bug is fixed that cause lines to appear in every photo.  It’s been a year now Will this app ever get fixed?????"
"10428",1048026594,"can you support ios 12 i love this app and can you update and also add weather filters and space"
"10429",1048130311,"I love this game but am consistently not being awarded the gems that I’ve won.  I’d give 5 stars but I’m so annoyed.  Fix the issues please!"
"10430",1048130311,"Used to be a great card game...now it’s rigged. You will either win a ton all in a row or lose double that all in row. It’s awful. This used to be my favorite game and today I am deleting it."
"10431",1048130311,"I used to love this game when I could play and win just enough hands to keep playing, but that’s no longer the case. It’s so frustrating to lose hand after hand without having any chance to win given the cards being dealt."
"10432",1048139188,"Of all the hockey games by this developer, this is the one to get. More teams. No energy bars that run out. Big Head hockey no rules first to 5 is a kick. $4 very fair price for entertainment value."
"10433",1048139188,"When I first played I was surprised about how good this game is you can pick any NHL team any international team and it has first to 5 goals in that game mode there are no rules"

You could adjust teams, add season mode, home or away team option, and player versus player mode could be included. Graphics are excellent."
"10435",1048228014,"Is it possible to get my money back?  The game won’t let us in."
"10436",1048228014,"My 3 year old was able to finish this like nothing and he still plays it. I just thought for the price there would be a lot more levels that what there were."
"10437",1048228014,"It's true that there should be more variety in the levels. That said, my 3 year old is delighted with the game, and that's why I bought it."
"10438",1048260999,"My 4-year-old really loved this game, but he had it beat in maybe 40-45 minutes. I was really surprised it was so short, especially having payed for it, but at least he loved it."
"10439",1048260999,"This game is great, my 4 year old loves it. My only complaint is that it's too short. We just downloaded it last night and he has already beat it.  If you pay $4 for s game you'd expect it to last a bit longer...."

"10441",1048277914,"I really like this type of game, and this one is very enjoyable!  I love the artwork, puzzles and unfolding of the story. I do rely heavily on the hints, (I'm a really old player) but they are clever and well done, and I expect next time I play it, I won't rely on them so much. ..and trust me, I will play it again!  😉 The story unfolds well, with sinister surprises, the puzzles are fun, and I LOVE my little companion - He's got personality! (won't say more, as I don't want to spoil the adventure for other players)."
"10442",1048277914,"Entertaining for a few hours. What more can you ask of a game?  No crashes or glitches.  Various puzzle levels for beginner or expert."

"10445",1048505998,"The game is okay and time can pass by. The game doesn’t have many optional things except killing monsters. One very good note is that the details on the monsters and troops or different units are amazing. I’m hoping for and update where people can attack the monsters. Also new units and more details that I wish you could add."

"10450",1048542880,"Made the mistake of starting this game casually 3 years ago, then joining an Alliance and making friends. The camaraderie is the ONLY redeeming quality of this game. Every thing else is about spending money. There is no parity, only pay to play dominance. This game setup fosters cyber bullying and the latest update introduced some random anime porn characters for no reason at all (except to entice players to spend more money). You’ll see the other reviews mention “Lee.” Lee.y is the name we all receive replies from when we complain about the horrid game. He prolly has a fleet of Lambo’s by now as some players have spent tens of thousands of dollars on this vile app. Do yourself a favor and get Candy Crush instead. This game and this developer are the WORST."
"10451",1048542880,"I met some really cool people on this game through my alliance, however, this game is a money hole, a pit of despair and a waste of time. Don’t fall down this rabbit hole. Lee will get you.   Henerik  s29 (I think it’s been a while) Freak AAC"

"10457",1048629983,"This is just a port of a PSP graphic update to a beloved game boy game that has aged very very poorly. While the polygonal 3-D graphics are snazzy, and the music as awesome as ever, the gameplay and storyline of this game were really never very engaging.....or fun to begin with.  Control wise, if you have an MFI controller, then it plays perfectly but who cares when you’ll be endlessly grinding against flat uninteresting monsters in order to accomplish forgettable fetch quests thrown at you by cardboard characters in a mellow dramatic, convoluted “story” so contrived and so ham fisted that it makes daytime soap operas feel like Shakespeare by comparison?  The game is riddled with game ending, unsolvable “puzzles” that involve doing asinine, ridiculously cryptic tasks like: walking around two trees in a the shape of a figure 8 until a secret door opens.....at some random, undisclosed place in the monotonous, one dimensional woods, that look like all the other woods. Without a walkthrough the game is virtually unbeatable.  With the look and sound being as good as it is, if this game were a completely reimagined (True Remake) of Final Fantasy Adventure then I think they could justify the relatively steep price.... but as it is? This game is just not worth the money or the time. The original was considered good in its time, for a game boy game (that people couldn’t beat even back then) but by todays standards your better off playing so many other games."
"10458",1048629983,"I loved this game back in the day. I found it on the App Store awhile back and have replayed it every few months or so. It is still continuously supported which is awesome. I really wish they would do a completely original sequel to this with these graphical updates."

"10468",1048881232,"This game is a tricky clone of another app by a reputable developer. This one regularly displays ads for other games, ads that are almost impossible to escape without flipping you over to the app store. Toddlers shouldn't be targeted for ads in the first place--much less frustrating ads that take over the screen and end up switching them out of the game they wanted to play. This is dirty, dirty behavior. I hope Apple cracks down on garbage like this SOON."
"10469",1048881232,"You need to add a way to remove ads.  Most ads are not age appropriate.  It’s a shame that you’ve ruined what would be a great app with constant full screen add interruptions."
"10470",1048881232,"I downloaded this for my toddler granddaughter.  We used to have it for the older grands and they loved it.  This time the ads were horrible.  Every thing she touched brought up an ad!  Totally frustrating to her and me.  I deleted it."
"10471",1048896882,"I love the game is super fun but the only problem I have is that when you make a level and you finish it to post it you have to constantly redo it until you get the thumbnail that you want. Otherwise great game"

I have over 3 million in coins and nothing to spend it on except nitro. Big bang racing you forgot about some of us people that made you who you are. I wish I was born with the creativity that some have in this game for building tracks. All I have is a thumb for racing!!  Marty G"

Nice interface, easy to use, an incredibly well designed set of keyboard additions, and works well alongside Working Copy for all my version control needs. I’m less able to be at a desktop than I used to, and this makes coding more accessible for me again 😊"
"10481",1049254261,"Wow, I gotta hand it to the creators of this app, it is simply amazing. I’m a web developer and when I’m away from my computer it is a struggle to write code on my phone. The normal texting keyboard just won’t cut it, that’s where Textastic comes in. With almost everything being customizable, code completion and intuitive shortcuts for all the normal dev symbols ex. (){}[]=$”; etc. this app is well worth the $9.99. Also, this app is very well maintained and is consistently being updated with fixes and requests from users on how to make the app better. Anyone writing code on the go should definitely pick this up. Great job!"

"10502",1050339928,"I bought this on a whim as I was looking for an app to create my own music visualizations.  Not exactly what I wanted, but I absolutely love it nonetheless and find the various tools to be quite adequate for creating a stellar array of beautiful imagery.   Highly addicting, and I cannot give the developer enough props for the SILKY smooth user interface and just the overall aesthetic.  Very tasteful.  A true masterpiece.    My only wish is that there would be two additional draw tools: 1. One that draws perfect circles that can be resized and spiraled with dragging motions, for easier “flower of life” type shapes  2.  A straight line tool, where you place point A, drag to point B, and when releasing the touch a perfectly straight line is drawn.  Currently, you have to swipe pretty fast to get anything close to a straight line and the swipe speed leads to lots of inaccuracies.  Also I would love to see this somehow someway morphed into a custom music visual creator. It would be divine.  That is what I was looking for to begin with, but I’m very happy to have found this."
"10503",1050339928,"It would be nice to have many undos. also it would be nice to have an option to hide the X and those on the bottom screen. i made some beautiful art only to be two stepped to blackness. if you could add a feature to hide the three like The X, share and the one that would be great."

"10510",1050452180,"This app is so helpful and is really keeping me on task. I feel like I’m accomplishing my goals so much more easily. I have more mental space without decision fatigue or overwhelm throughout the day since everything I need and want to do has its own spot in my day now.  I do wish I not have to assign a day for special routines that aren’t regular-like a shortened routine for a special event, emergency or just needing extra sleep. Pretty much every day in my week has a slight difference and I’d love to be able to see my week at a glance with my different routines on each day.  I also wish there was some more excitement when the timer goes to the next task. It’d be nice if I could click “done” or “skip” instead of the timer just moving on to the next task. It would be awesome if it played music and went to the next song for each task. I wouldn’t mind if the voice command gave some kind of encouragement along the way too..like “you’re very focused today! Keep going!” Etc.   Even without those, it’s a great app and has made a very big positive difference for me and my family! Thank you!!"
"10511",1050452180,"I generally like the user experience. But one thing that bothers me is that if you move on to the next task before the time runs out on the current task, then the current tasks won’t be marked as “completed”.  So if you give yourself 15 minutes to eat breakfast, but finish eating in just 10 minutes, then you have to sit around and do nothing for 5 minutes if you want the “eat breakfast” task to be marked as complete.  If you skip ahead to the next task before the time is up, it doesn’t get marked as competed. So weird!  You also don’t have an option of completing tasks out of order.  So if your next task is “take a shower” but your partner is using the bathroom, you can’t just move on to another task and come back to the current one later.  The Routinist app has really figured out all these little details. But their UI isn’t very good. I think the Morning Routine app developers should try to duplicate all of Routinist’s features, but keep the good UI that Morning Routine has. That would make a truly killer app."
"10512",1050452180,"I really love this app, it has been very helpful to me in the morning and keeps me on time and helps me stay on schedule. After my positive experience with the morning routine I wanted to create an evening routine also but then to my surprise I couldn’t. I had to pay $12(!!) for anymore routines. I have now started using a second app for my evening routine due to the issue with paying for more routines. I would have payed 4 or 5 dollars but not above that. I love my morning routine though and I recommend this app if you’re just looking for 1 routine!"
"10513",1050535507,"I love everything about this game, like the story and characters, like the gameplay and difficulty, I’ve unlocked master on every single song except for the last one in stage 4. But I need you to change the daily song system. I don’t care that it’s random, that’s what I expected and there are no issues. Definitely don’t mind that you need to see an ad to play it. That makes sense. But please let me choose my difficulty. I understand if I cannot get master difficulty but if I get whisper difficulty every time then I’m not going to use it. If I want to just listen to the song I’d look it up on YouTube!"
"10514",1050535507,"I love this game, but most of the songs have become boring after playing them all the time. I don’t have the money to constantly buy the new packs, and I thought this new Daily Song system sounded awesome! I get to play new songs all the time now! I usually only play a little each day, so it’ll be great for me, right?  Oh, so wrong.  You see, you get five chances every day. Firstly, the song you get is random. You don’t have any control over what song you play. That wouldn’t be so bad, even though you have to watch an ad beforehand, if it weren’t for the second problem. You don’t even get to choose the difficulty. WHY?! What is there to gain by preventing your players from choosing the diff? It says a “random difficulty”, but I got Whisper, the easiest one, all five times. As an experienced player, it was so boring I quit every time trying to get ONE harder song, and never did. Also, if it is truly random, imagine the opposite problem. A new player keeps getting hard songs, gets intimidated and never buys any of them. Or worse, they never play again.  I’d like to say I appreciate the IDEA. I think a daily song is great, and hey, if I like a map enough I might just consider buying it. But as it stands, being unable to see what I’m buying makes me very apprehensive, and this new Daily Song system does not alleviate my worries in the slightest."

"10526",1050973882,"This game is pretty fun, but it has a few drawbacks that keep it from being perfect. First off the progression in this game is S L O W, when I upgraded my hq to level 5 it cost 250,000 supplies, that was fair enough, but then for upgrading to level 6 it suddenly jumps up to 750,000, not cool Bohemia, the ArmA pedigree deserves better. The other thing holding this game back is that the campaign stories take a massive spike up in difficulty in some of the levels, and like I said, the progression is slow so you often times hit a wall where you don’t have the troops or the resources to win a battle.   UPDATE: A new issue with this game has come to my attention, the matchmaking system blows. Not only have three of the last five players to attack my base been drastically underleveled and stood no chance of beating me, the other two players to attack me were near double my level! When I went into the matchmaking myself hoping for a player at least near my level, the game sent me (a level 27 player) to attack a level 206 player! Seriously Bohemia fix this game’s issues, your company knows better than to release an underdeveloped game like this under the ArmA pedigree."

You can play multiplayer but you have to both have to get the same version and it has to be Snowboard party world tour pro. It does cost 10.00$ It is a little over priced but otherwise it is a great game!"
"10541",1051434604,"You have to stick with it. At first, I felt that the control stick was awkward, and it felt a little weird that you have to press a button to grind (similar to the THPS/THUG games, instead of just grinding automatically like the SSX games) All that said, you just have to stick with it. I’m now used to the controls, and there’s a ton of content here (considering a price tag of $10) There’s a freestyle, half-pipe, and big air event, with several maps for each, and plenty of characters to equip with stat upgrades, and alternate boards and outfits. The graphics are pretty good, and even go as far as leaving a trail in the snow behind you (a few other snowboarding apps I’ve played actually miss this small detail, which doesn’t hurt gameplay, but the added immersion it brings in this instance is nice) This game is about as close to SSX as I can imagine playing on my phone. Really good work from the developer, would recommend."
"10542",1051434604,"I really enjoyed playing this game and I was excited to play it again after downloading it on my new phone tonight.  My excitement quickly turned to frustration after I noticed that the game didn’t transfer over anything from my old phone.  It’s seriously upsetting... I spent a lot of time and money on this game to unlock courses, boards, riders, their outfits, and max out skills.  The App Store didn’t make me purchase this game again just because I’m on a new phone!"
"10543",1051638513,"It is a horrible game but sometimes fun"
"10544",1051638513,"I love this game soooooo much I mean like it makes u feel like ur actual driving a car it is so realistic and it may help when u learn how to drive."
"10545",1051638513,"how in the world has anyone completed extreme level 14 with three stars? its the only extreme level that seems impossible to fully complete."
"10546",1051656345,"I spent the whole softball season not knowing where the heck our games would be because the app does not sync with the web. It rains a lot in Chicago so games co Stanley get cancelled.  I would contact support but there is NO support link in the app. And when you select support on the app review page, it goes to a dead page. Get your act together before telling us this is a great tool.  If you had customer support available I would have contacted them rather than slamming you here."
"10547",1051656345,"How do you update to this school year. It still shows last year. New game dates are on the school website. ????"
"10548",1051656345,"Positive: The really nice thing about the 8 to 18 app is the opportunity to select categories of interest for your family, covering multiple activities, grades, and seasons.  It’s convenient and helpful to have all the information collected in one place.   Needs improvement: 1. The display on My Calendar is arranged in a Monday through Sunday format, which is disorienting as most American calendars display Sunday through Saturday. Please add a convenient way to choose alternate formats.   2. On the landing page “today’s events” and “upcoming events” you have to swipe down to update, or it will show old dates. Why not update when the app opens instead of having to manually update?   3. There is a way to export 8 to 18 files for import into Google or Microsoft calendars, but it would be nice if it was easier or more obvious how to do that."
"10549",1051708566,"Super sélection de restos et appli plutôt bien faite. Mais un bug majeur, l’appli vide la batterie en quelques minutes. Pour vous donner un ordre de grandeur, je pense que je perds 20% en 5 minutes d’utilisation de l’application, ce qui la rend extrêmement penible a utiliser. Ce problème réglé je serai heureux de remettre 5 étoiles."
"10550",1051708566,"Bizarrement l’application mentionne l’emplacement des Mac Donald mais pas des petits et très bons bistrots parisiens. Peut-être faut-il passer un accord pour figurer dans cette application qui privilégie apparemment les restaurants à la mode plutôt que la qualité ?"
"10551",1051708566,"This has the best dining list for Paris and France. However it’s a shame the app doesn’t allow to filter down search. Like bars, brunch, vegan, etc... the UI could be improved"
"10552",1051755724,"Great to listen to Bill & Tunch rather then on TV! I pause the TV (DVR) so the radio delay is synced to the TV. Then I don’t have to listen to CBS I can just watch the game and listen to Bill and Tunch! Great App."
"10553",1051755724,"The whole point of buying the app was to listen to the Pittsburgh Steelers play… it is blocked in my area so the app is worthless to people outside of Pittsburgh."
"10554",1051755724,"I love that even in California I know what’s going on with my boys thank you 💛❤️💙"
"10555",1052035509,"This game sucked so bad my brain is about to explode because of how boring this Minecraft copy is"
"10556",1052035509,"This game is good and defiantly can be better. These are something that should be added  1. More weapons 2. More Dinos 3.More craft able items 4. Make the map show were you are 5.Add a cursor it is so hard to aim the spear 6.Make the bone not have unlimited arrows  I know this is a lot and hard to add but it will really help the game"
"10557",1052035509,"😀This game is good  😡game gets boring after awhile I mean real boring like nothing to do yeah but good potential.  Could be a 😄 but now just a 😐 make it co-op so i would be able to play online or with Game Center friends or just through wifi play co-op. Other then that good game I would recommend it to almost anyone just give it some time. Thank you bye"
"10558",1052109508,"I have a very reluctant math student in my house and he didn’t even realize that he was doing math with this game. Amazing. That said, it crashes at level 13 every time :/ hope this gets fixed soon!!!"
"10559",1052109508,"The app worked till I purchased and after that it started crashing."
"10560",1052109508,"I’m a teacher and this app is really great about embedding the concept of decomposing numbers into a fun puzzle game."
"10561",1052231801,"this is the game thats great"
"10562",1052231801,"It’s really dumb tbh"
"10563",1052231801,"This game is so addicting and I love it!"
"10564",1052556488,"This game would be so much better if it didn’t always close and reload when you leave the app or switch to a different app. As it is it annoys me so much I stopped playing"
"10565",1052556488,"First time doing a review. Love this game! Extremely high replay value! Strategist dream!  Some puzzles are hard so those 1/5 stars are people that give up easy.  Easy mode for casuals players. Great community on FB.  Crazy party settings after beating the game once!"
"10566",1052556488,"Not a review writer, but this game deserves some merit.  Detailed enough to make the characters feel unique.  Very expansive.  Reminds me of exploring the original Zelda map as a kid, but with a stacked party of hero, and way bigger world. Lots of cool gear to find.  The creator is very active with updates and making the game better.  I have had the game for a few years, and have not yet finished it, as I am busy, but have leveled several parties up to level 20 multiple times.  Currently running a party of with two barbarians, a knight, a Druid, a wizard and of corse, a Cleric.  I love trying to roll the perfect stats for each character.  Great game, and much appreciation to the developer!  Thanks!"
"10567",1052582820,"Just stupid"
"10568",1052582820,"You get five levels then you have to pay for the rest!!! 😡 But it's not that bad.😀"
"10569",1052582820,"Ok I thought it was a good game by its cover but I forgot the saying don't judge a book by its cover anyways it cost money to even go to the school that's insane so we can't even play the whole game I hate things like that!"
"10570",1052661250,"The app says Japanese and English as the two languages but it’s only Japanese. I would love to play this game it looks fun and all but I can’t really play if I don’t know what a single word means. Please make these game in English thank you very much"

"10574",1052682268,"I like how there are different areas. The art is cute but it isn't special. I tried to do the part where you pick your train color and drive around picking up people to be on your train--except the ""challenge(s)"" were just blocks that you move into place to fix the broken road every single time! It was so annoying; there should be an option where you just just drive around and enjoy the scenery. I also wanted to like how you can pretend to operate the train when I realized the background was my finger; making reality the backdrop of the train operation made it far less interesting in my opinion. It's cool how you can draw in one of the things, but this isn't a drawing app. Overall a mixed bag of cuteness, little bit of fun, trains, and lots of confusion and frustration."
"10575",1052682268,"If your little one likes trains... This one should not be missed. Grab it right away!"
"10576",1052726188,"The game stop in the loading screem"
"10577",1052726188,"do not buy this game PLEASE!!!! i was looking for a new rhythm to play and i found a perfect vocaloid one but it freezes in the loading screen... rip my dollar"
"10578",1052726188,"Unfortunately after playing the PC game Invaxion I had high standards for this game but it won’t even work past the loading screen. I wish the devs could take the time to fix it but it seems discontinued based on the dates written in game ending at 2016 which is a shame I would loved to have been able to play this."
"10579",1052729607,"I wanted you to know I’m eight and down loading this it’s good but 12$ just for all the other levels please stop this madness!"
"10580",1052729607,"It is fun but you have to buy the full version"
"10581",1052729607,"I don’t think it’s fair to be like “buy this to unlock five more levels” like most of your games are fair tab tale. I would rate it a one but I rated it a two cause my little cousins still like it. Please update game to where you can play the five more levels cause it would make it more fun and you would have better ratings. Thank you for reading this review."
"10582",1052744048,"Every time I try to play the dress up it freezes. I hate this game I’m going to delete it.its also very inappropriate for my daughter."
"10583",1052744048,"the app pee"
"10584",1052744048,"I think the game is okay 👌 but a little bit of inappropriate too"
"10585",1052744981,"Everything is locked, on all of your games... It's stupid. Like if it's a FREE game there should be everything free.. Make it free, or I will never play your games again! Not that you care, but the point of having the games is to make kids the opposite of bored!!! 😕😕😕🙏🙏🙏😑😑😑👎👎"

"10588",1052958353,"It’s trash"
"10589",1052958353,"The only thing the full version gets you is hints and no ads it doesn’t go any further than the free version and for as short as the game is it’s not worth the money plus you can’t customize anything the truck is built one way and that’s it, you can’t explore the town you save or anything you just rebuild the truck and it kicks you out and you have start all over again I’ve done it 3 times and it’s exactly the same every time"
"10590",1052958353,"Awesome game."
"10591",1052994265,"Uploaded the pic and there were no options to do anything else."
"10592",1052994265,"Downloaded this two years ago and it’s the reason my daughter believes in Santa! She keeps telling people how I caught him in the middle of the night..!  Now though the app is truly terrible! Not sure what happened but all the good pics of Santa are gone and you only have very limited bad choices. Gets worse every year too!  I hate to say it but save your time and money and move on. Maybe someone else will pick up this great idea and make kids believe again.."
"10593",1052994265,"Too mich abs and plus the picture look fake"
"10594",1053012308,"I open the game and it takes 3 minutes to load I go into battle and the game doesn’t load it just crashes and I lose trophies. Supercell you guys are terrible. Not to mention people still hack this game and drop 40-50 elixir at a time. Save your time and energy don’t play this trash game"
"10595",1053012308,"Great game. Entertaining. It’s a bummer card and tower levels play such an important role in climbing trophy ladder. The variety in good decks is also not great. You’ll play against the same 5 decks over and over, and they’re popular for a reason - they’re winnable. If you try to introduce variety, you’ll likely lose, which feels bad."
"10596",1053012308,"I had 4000 trophies and I’m level 8 and I’m going against level 13s"
"10597",1053189283,"Entertaining especially love the fact I don’t have to spend additional funds to play a game."
"10598",1053189283,"Really fun game with great graphics."
"10599",1053189283,"Graphics are delightful.  Mini games are fun, not too hard.  Romantic story line is pleasant change from the usual dark murder mystery."
"10600",1053285387,"This app is really great and all but I have my notifications on and i still dont know when im being texted on the app"
"10601",1053285387,"For some reason every time I click the app it makes me sign in every time"
"10602",1053285387,"It doesn’t give me the code to log in"
"10603",1053388964,"Have this game for both my iPhone and PC. Fantastic way to keep mind shape and to unwind after a busy day at work. Recommend it anyone who loves a great game !"
"10604",1053388964,"Cool"
"10605",1053388964,"Just deleted this game. The last two updates weren't  necessary. The game was fine before it. It freezes and crashes. It's not worth watching the ads. I'm not spending any money on this game! Thanks for making space on my phone. Deleted."
"10606",1053524307,"Love watching the sharks and fish swim around me! This app makes me feel so calm and peaceful. Although if I was really surrounded by sharks and fish I’d freak out! 😆"
"10607",1053524307,"The app was amazing but when you got far enough in to the game it shuts off."
"10608",1053524307,"Wish I didn’t have to delete it really liked this app but my phone kept locking so idk what’s up with that."
"10609",1053562258,"Fun game but it freezes at the police station after finding the feather piece. Won’t allow you to continue just goes back to home screen. Restarted it, uninstalled it, updated to latest iOS available and still the same. Want to finish game but can’t. Help."
"10610",1053562258,"Great Game!!"
"10611",1053562258,"This game played great on my iPad mini 2 which is so slow, but the game did not play slow at all.  I love spooky games and this delivered.  You can customize the time length for how long you want the hint feature to reset and I LOVE THIS! Great bonus game too.  Great game!"
"10612",1053605807,"I like the new graphics and the other stuff. I also like the default solar system that comes. However, Pluto appears to be shaking and having a broken (and jumping) trail, and the entire planet is pixelated and appears to be corrupt. Perhaps running out of floating-point precision like Minecraft? I don't what to tell you, man."
"10613",1053605807,"I got this app because I just really love the idea of space and being able to create this kind of universe. The recent changes with this app were all stellar and I love them, although it would be nice to choose between the new and old layouts. My biggest concern is the fact that I can’t play around with any ideas if I already have one I like. I decided I wanted to make a universe for a space traveler story I want to write, but unless I want to lose that whole world, I can’t just mess around and cause the collapse of a universe. So it’d be real cool if that was possible. More information on the planets and the life forms, and a way to add life forms to habitable planets would be very neat! This app has an excellent base, but I’d love to see more done with it."
"10614",1053605807,"Texture issues with the black hole. I wish I could slow down time a little bit because it’s hard to interact with your planets when they are going to fast for you to even tap. It’s pretty cool."
"10615",1053688442,"I think many people can agree that this game is CRAZY addictive. I would give it five stars, but every few levels, the game crashes. Right at the boss and it really annoys me. If you guys could fix it, then that would be amazing"
"10616",1053688442,"Ya should add a save feature so what if somebody deleted the app lost all their progress and have to start all over."

"10627",1053946396,"Tried it a few times during games and could not get the Celtics on the radio. Worthless.  Developer said not to give the app a bad rating without trying to contact him through customer service. I tried that too — a few weeks ago — and never got a response.   Basically all this app would do is listen to talk radio instead of games. I don’t want that, and even if I did, I wouldn’t need an app to listen to talk radio."
"10628",1053946396,"Nice app but think it needs an update because many stations unavailable."
"10629",1053946396,"Paid for app -intermittently re’d audio. Much missed."
"10630",1054011814,"It needs to be more clear on how to use the app"
"10631",1054011814,"Was easy to use"
"10632",1054011814,"For iPhone it works pretty well, my biggest issue is that regardless of what account you sign in it doesn’t show all your audio files that you have actually uploaded to your drive. Which limits song availability for what the app offers,otherwise it’s fine!!"
"10633",1054033219,"The app used to work perfectly but now it won't find the TVs or speakers 98% of the time. It's a miracle when it does."

"10642",1054501757,"I played the first Lifeline game and really liked the main character, Taylor. I appreciated the pop culture references and only had to look up one. The game is written in a way that feels like real banter between friends. It captivated me. I admit I had to go back for a second round to get to the “best possible” outcome. I loved the ability to fast track the game the second time I played. Great game that captures your attention and keeps it throughout."

"10644",1054501757,"Hey I’m a little late rip some money on my last iPhone but ehh, the storyline continues very interesting follow up because like the last one it could go anywhere it wants.. the story that is another thing. “I’m just gonna stay in my uncomfortable bunk... and be uncomfortable “ [Taylor is uncomfortable] man I laughed so hard"

"10650",1054948424,"awesome app! but recently it has turned buggy on both my ipad air 2 and iphone 7 plus   the search is very buggy  plz put it to consideration"
"10651",1055138354,"Pressing left on the controller brings up the pause menu. Controls pretty much don’t work at all during menus. Touch controls do not disappear when using the controller. I don’t mess with touch controls when playing platformers and other games of the like (I don’t know why anyone would), so this game is unplayable. Basically I’ve just given five dollars for nothing."
"10652",1055138354,"Not as good as the previous version."
"10653",1055138354,"The review by GoodGuyAvetis is right. It seems that the dividing line separating the left and right buttons isn't centered on my iphone 6. Therefore tapping right makes my ninja go left sometimes. Actually it does that a lot (going left instead of right). eg, instead of ⬅️  |  ➡️ it feels like  ⬅️    |➡️ As you can see there's not much tapping area for right button. If you tap a little to the left of right button, you'll go left.   I have to stretch out my thumb and position it more towards the center of the screen in order to be certain my ninja guy will go right when I tap right otherwise it's a crapshoot (he'll inexplicably go left and get killed). It's awkward and so uncomfortable, my thumb reverts back to a more natural position if I forget about it during gameplay. As a result, I keep dying over the lamest sht like going in the wrong direction.   I can't say if this is a problem on other devices with differing screen sizes because idk. I just know it's a problem when I play on my iphone 6. That's why I don't enjoy playing this game because it's so frustrating. It ruins the whole thing. Do I regret buying this game? Hell yeah I do. Therefore I cant recommend it if you have a device with a similar sized screen. (Assuming that's the problem).   Why can't you developers just shift the perimeters for both left and right buttons just a little more to the left? Then the dividing line would shift a little left and become more centered resulting in more tapping area for the right button.   To be honest, I don't have much confidence they'll even look into it seeing how they infrequently update their games and their tendency to just stop updating altogether after barely a year since release. I hope I'm wrong though."

"10656",1055204150,"A great story about how Rudolph embraces his uniqueness to save the day for Santa. Beautiful artwork, nice animation and cute voices when you tap on each character. My kids love it!"

"10660",1055281310,"My church purchased over 120 Hue Bulbs, 3 Bridges, and 6 dimmer switches (for 6 zones).    WE NEED YOUR APP TO CONTROL MORE THAN 1 BRIDGE AT A TIME.   We want to push 1 dimmer switch button and have ALL LIGHTS on 3 bridges turn off/on.  Currently we have to push 6 dimmer switch buttons and the result is SOMETIMES THEY WORK AND SOMETIMES THEY DON’T, even though we get a green light on the dimmer switch.   We have done the UPDATES.  We have tried other apps with very poor results. MOST apps do not apply to more than one bridge.  Those that do apply to more than 1 bridge are Quirky.  HELP US PLEASE...This should work.

"10661",1055281310,"I’m happy with the Hue app except one major thing I know everybody complains about...GROUPING ROOMS!!!! Why is this not included? I want to control the whole house at one time using room groups. Now, I do see the beta version of an upper level “zoning” which works somewhat but at least add a copy and paste feature from already created individual room scenes, I don’t want to create whole new scenes on upper level room groups. Also, light grouping...Tying multiple lights together. and.... being able to copy and paste color light hues from room to room."
"10662",1055281310,"The widgets feature works great. Therefore, I have 8 Widgets setup so I can recall the scenes just by a few touches on my Apple Watch or my iOS devices. The only and the major problem here is, those widgets disappear every few weeks or so. And every time it happens, I have to redo the whole thing all over again. Which is extremely annoying. Please fix it."

"10666",1055376602,"This game is fantastic, but there needs to be an update to support iPhone X, XS and XR phones. It would look great being fullscreen. Other than that, pretty good game"
"10667",1055376602,"Please buff"
"10668",1055376602,"wasted my money on this game… controls are awful. extremely frustrating, next to impossible to land on a planet. very unhappy with this purchase"
"10669",1055387127,"Played this game at the arcade so much that we would’ve been able to purchase the arcade machine! Thank goodness its not on a credits to start game like back then!"
"10670",1055387127,"The game is look great but there are something like control on the left corner take big margin from the screen and is not the original arcad game (SUPER BANG ..... no ladders.... ) and I recommend if we can play the game with other player (via Bluetooth )...."
"10671",1055387127,"Plays great, love it."
"10672",1055455919,"I do not need another game on my phone this game is the best!!!!"
"10673",1055455919,"This is personally one of the best games I’ve ever owned and I have owned a lot of games, here is why... it is a very enjoyable game and fun to get high scores with lots of hidden characters and has a great dungeon crawler feel mixed with 2015 style crossyroad controls. I love the mix of characters from knights and wizards to goblins and ninjas. It has good sounds and graphics that also make up a fun dungeon crawler game. I don’t know if a whole lot of people still play this game but taco Illuminati should make some new updates so people will. My high score is 77 doors... good luck beating it!"
"10674",1055455919,"Y eet"
"10675",1055486126,"Seriously I would love to rate higher but can not play without inventory. Please fix"
"10676",1055486126,"Mid game the inventory stopped working. Twice. I will not try a third time. Even when working the story is boring. I want a refund!"
"10677",1055486126,"I experienced the same problem that several others had. My inventory disappeared and I couldn't go on. There doesn't appear to be an update that addresses this problem, so I won't be able to play the game. Very disappointed."
"10678",1055502792,"I would ask if in the one or to events, make a Hall of Fame event that can have the best players at their prime. Ex: Kyrie Irving Cav, Kobe Bryant Lak, Michael Jordan Chi, Lebron James Mia, Allen Iverson Six, etc. This could have these players at 90 to start, and the ending overall could be 107 and up. There should also be packs for the events. I am sure this event would make people’s days if they see this. Please add this event."
"10679",1055502792,"The game glitches before I even get to main screen smh"
"10680",1055502792,"I got 12000 nba cash for 2 dollars and did not even give me the cash. The game has terrible graphics and uses so much data. Ea is just money hungry and won’t give you what you buy with real money."
"10681",1055538670,"This app is very helpful for me. When I want to change the lighting, I come straight to this app. I tried other apps that are supposed to help, but this app is the best out of all."
"10682",1055538670,"You’ll need this trust me!"
"10683",1055538670,"Can't process 4k videos 🙁"
"10684",1055570687,"The game keeps crashing and so I can't play it"
"10685",1055570687,"Love this game.   I play it everyday and I am hooked."
"10686",1055570687,"Addicting"
"10687",1055571047,"Level 21 says it’s clear but it only showing retry or home Booooooooooooooooo soooo bad   Ps are you Chinese"
"10688",1055571047,"I love the game, it’s fun, but there’s too many ads and it doesn’t really explain too well, like when it freezes it confuses me. Otherwise I think it’s a good game to play when you’re bored.."
"10689",1055571047,"It’s an ok game you just pull down I would still play if you can get rid of the adds or at least be able to skip them so because of that I give it a 2"
"10690",1055636344,"“Mainstage” for iPad. I can control all my instruments and plugins for live performance in one spot.  Also product support is fantastic!"
"10691",1055636344,"Really, really pleased w/ AUM. What a useful tool. The beautiful UI is icing on the cake."
"10692",1055636344,"Many people wonder whether they should get AudioBus or AUM.   I’ve used Audiobus since it’s first version so to me that answer was clear once I came back to iOS music production: AudioBus 3.   That being said there’s so much talk about AUM going around so I HAD to get it eventually. I must say I wouldn’t “choose” between one anymore.   Both are great and I would certainly recommend any: AUM however is far more intuitive and had a sleeker UI.   One thing I love about AUM is it’s AUv3 handling; the resizing of windows is amazing and really lets you take advantage of the small iPhone’s screen. You can have several apps at once displayed on a small tiny screen which I find amazing.   That being said, this is the only reason I wrote a review:  There’s another kid in town who does this even SLIGHTLY better than AUM, and that is ApeMatrix. I have the three and tbh I choose a different one depending on what I need. Often times I even combine them into my workflow.   However, ApeMatrix does ONE thing better than AUM in AUv3 territory and I beg AUM to take note and implement the same behavior as it really would make the app quite better:  ApeMatrix will let you resize AUv3 plugins just like AUM does, but the huge advantage to ApeMatrix is that these AUv3 modules remember their position on screen even after being closed. Unfortunately AUM does not do this; this means everytime you open multiple AUm3 instances you have to organize them on your screen whereas on ApeMatrix you do that once and it’s set for the whole project. This allows ApeMatrix to work better as a AUv3 host as I can simply use this app in conjunction with my midi keyboard and pads to trigger opening such plugins whenever I need to have them on sight.   The second detail is that double clicking on the “edge” of a plugin’s window in ApeMatrix automatically makes it full screen: AUM does the same but if you double click again it RESETS its UI, as opposed to ApeMatrix which preserves the “minimized UI” and leads you back to it once you double click on the edge again.   This is also amazing and should be implemented in AUM as it allows for one to have multiple “mini AUv3” plugins which you can maximize to have full control of through the screen only when needed.   These are two small requests that could potentially make AUM even better.  Otherwise, this is a great app and a friendlier  version of AudioBus, also sleeker (you’ll probably need both in the long run tho, and also ApeMatrix. Best 3 mixers out there)."
"10693",1055672607,"I really like this game, it’s really fun and helpful to relax. But the button for buying no ads doesn’t work, no matter how many times I press it. I’d be fine with paying for this but it doesn’t work! :( Please fix it!"
"10694",1055672607,"I would love the option to remove ads. It’s there but you can’t click it. FIX IT PLEASE. Other than that another fun game to play by Gram"
"10695",1055672607,"Fun addictive game, however it keeps freezing"
"10696",1055677337,"works fine and i like the idea but why doesn’t it block ads?"
"10697",1055677337,"This one blocks ads in Safari for free, SEAMLESSLY!"
"10698",1055677337,"Great browser! I enjoy being able to use a browser know that I’m not being tracked or worry about cookies being added to my browser."
"10699",1055684003,"I really enjoy the game. I would like to have the ability to salvage the items i dont need into scrap metal or wood. Still great game"
"10700",1055684003,"I go back to this game about one month a year, it’s a good game in spurts like that, unfortunately can’t get my fill on the newest iPhone iteration. Crazy game breaking bugs on the iPhone X character walks off the screen never to be seen again. Camera never pans down. Make it playable for me again!"
"10701",1055684003,"I bought this on steam earlier today and I’m so glad they have a version for iOS. Not sure what some of these older reviews are, but I’ve have no problems with running the game."
"10702",1055714800,"I paid a $1 for this after seeing it on Fox 19 News this morning. It's a shoddy app that just repeats the same phrase over and over again. Not to mention the abuse splash page you have to sit and click through every time you want to use it is just obnoxious."
"10703",1055714800,"The app claims it plays different messages but I've tried it on my own without the child around and it plays the same message every time. I don't think it's going to be believable after a couple of uses."
"10704",1055714800,"My kid flipped out when I told him it was bath time. I told him ""Santa's Watching"" and played the message and he got into the bath without a peep!  This is great!  I plan to use this all year, not just during the holidays."
"10705",1055825012,"I guess it's the most beautiful game, that I have ever played by Epix, so I leave 5 stars here, though after finishing it I wanted to reduce it to 4 ...too many glitches in the mini games, unfortunately. The graphics, the animation, the colors, the music, the landscapes, the costumes are just amazing! It's also a nice touch, that you can play Majong both instead of HOPs and in the Extras...The game is perfect, but the story is a little bit boring. Anyway, it's absolutely worth to buy it !"
"10706",1055825012,"Great game... Loved playing it... I've played lots and lots of big fish games and some of them are boring or too glitchy but this one was smooth and lots of fun!"
"10707",1055825012,"Please make more like this, was sooo entertaining!"
"10708",1056224570,"Keep saying bad connection no wifi or data"
"10709",1056224570,"App isn’t working what’s goin on?"
"10710",1056224570,"This is gud"
"10711",1056364454,"I paid to not have ads a yr ago now they want me to pay again.Tried to send a email but keep getting a error message....and on top of that they charging a $7.49 fee for a wk who tf pays that not even Apple Music charge that much i want my mf money back"
"10712",1056364454,"I loved musictrax and recommended the app to all my friends until after I had a good collection of my favorite songs. Then Musictrax decided to hold my music hostage! They blocked me from my downloaded music and the only way I can hear them now is to agree to pay them $7.49 per WEEK! That’s nearly $400.00 a year. I can buy what I want other places and not worry about my music taken away! So no thanks Musictrax!!"
"10713",1056364454,"I use to love this app until the 7 free trial what ever happen just normal free music please fix the app and cancel the 7 free trial"
"10714",1056489580,"always have sales on various products，save time，save money！"
"10715",1056489580,"Hope they can ship internationally."
"10716",1056489580,"Have a variety of baby clothes and brands available, very continent"
"10717",1056668779,"This game excels in every way and particularly as an education tool and introduction to the intrigue and conundrums of Tudor London. Excellent!"
"10718",1056668779,"such a good app, love playing it. well made with solid music and a strong story. Recommend to everyone!"
"10719",1056668779,"Love this game. Cool soundtrack and fluid gameplay."
"10720",1056681903,"Gracias por tan excelente app los felicito desde Puerto Rico"
"10721",1056681903,"I love using DJ Pro the experience is exciting and amazing"
"10722",1056681903,"As much as I like the new djay app, I want my custom sampler back. I’m gonna stick with djay Pro for a while until support has been dropped."
"10723",1056813463,"I am standing outside the Dunkin’ Donuts I always order from which is open 24 hours and they don’t show as an option to order from on the app. I have used app in past to order, but last couple of weeks, my store has disappeared."
"10724",1056813463,"Needs to be fixed. Malfunctions constantly. Never got my birthday drink and I try to use religiously lol waste of good efforts."
"10725",1056813463,"The app has been acting very well for a while. Suddenly it keeps shutting itself down just after the screen logo pops up. I reinstalled it the first time; it was ok. Now it’s doing it again."
"10726",1056893074,"This app seems amazing and easy I love that it has all the foods listed to make shopping easier I just wish it connected to my Apple Watch for my exercise HIIT workouts which I do at a gym so it would be nice to have my watch track it for me but other then that it’s great"
"10727",1056893074,"I have found this app very useful for knowing what to eat at which meals/snacks.  Daily meals are linked to recipes which is super convenient.  Only had this 3 days but so far I have found it helpful."
"10728",1056893074,"I read the entire Dr. Phil 20/20 book.  This app is easy, but a few things are missing in the instructions.  For instance you need to have 2 cups of green tea a day and a large glass of water with each meal ... just saying.  But this app is much easier to use then the official one."
"10729",1056954483,"I don’t know what to say about Watch Games. It’s exactly what you get. It has 3 games on it, none of which are groundbreaking, obviously, but they’re fun little time-wasters. I guess I should give my opinion on each  Breakout- Not sure what this is called and I don’t have my Apple Watch on me right now, so I can’t remember the name, but essentially it’s just breakout but with upgraded graphics. Only complaint is sometimes the ball will be stuck only going across the X-Axis, making it just go side to side and essentially soft locking the game.   Defender-  Again, forget the name. I can’t recognize this game, so I’m going to assume it’s original. Basically, dodge asteroids, collect fuel and last as long as possible. The ship automatically goes to the side, so you just move the Digital Crown to move it up and down.   Viper-  THIS game’s name I remember. Just Snake but you move in 360°.   All and all, it’s an ok app. I do wish there were score boards, they don’t even have to be online, just local. The game’s don’t count your score. But when scores is the worst thing about your game, you’re in a good position. All and all, I highly recommend downloading this app and just trying it out. It’s free, after all, not to mention there’s no ads. Mediocre, but in a good way. 9/10 (4/5 stars)."
"10730",1056954483,"Ok so I know the last time anything has been done to this game was a long time and with the new Apple Watch Series 4 44mm there is no lag but I would love to see a update to make it full screen in the Series 4 44mm.                                                          Thank you."
"10731",1056954483,"Games work but I can not move the items as I need to. I just paid $1.07 for a game to watch not play on my watch what a rip off."
"10732",1056968162,"I’m rating it 5 stars just so u can see it. Do not get."
"10733",1056968162,"I ABSOLUTELY LOOOVVE THIS GAME! just a couple requests  1: Can you please add youtubers such as SkyDoesMinecraft, LittleLizardGaming, and so on? They made toys but not the game, please add them  2: I hate this. Whenever I need to save up energy, it doesn't. I need to keep the app running and it takes up A LOT of my battery power running something I'm not using please fix these and I will rate it 5 Stars"
"10734",1056968162,"I love this game but I have a five year old brother and he loves tube heroes and he uses an iPad mini and it won't work we got the game and ever thing please make iPad minis work to?!!"
"10735",1056999701,"This game was by far one of my favorite VR games when it first came out. Unfortunately it looks like you guys stopped updating it. This really bothers me that is wont get any better and that is why I gave it 3 stars"
"10736",1056999701,"I wish more VR games supported mfi controllers. It blows me away that they don’t. It’s a shame the Google Cardboard is such a profoundly limiting platform; even the viewing angle suffers. With that said, it is an excellent game tarnished by some rather serious design flaws.   A huge part of the fun for a game like this is PILOTING a space ship and yet we can’t do this here. Instead, we hardly more than float through a dog fight while we shoot the baddies around us. I realize that this is an accommodation to the Cardboard platform but I really wish they had included a way to accelerate when using a game pad. Immersion suffers significantly because of it. Additionally, running out of ammo is just a stupid way to end a game.  Ultimately, the game offers an exciting taste of what the future of iOS gaming holds—but just a taste."
"10737",1056999701,"This is how mobile vr is done people"
"10738",1057030968,"A super weather app. The clean design is easy to us and a pleasure to even get bad weather reports on."
"10739",1057030968,"While this is a decent free weather app, it heavily relies on my iPhone to work, if I’m out of range of my iPhone which I tend to be a lot it doesn’t work on its own through my watch it seems to need to have the app reopened on the phone to load any data. If this is fixed I’ll redownload, for now I’ve switched."
"10740",1057030968,"UI terrific. Generally very accurate weather, and good arrangement of the data on app, but the app loses two stars each for (1) excruciatingly slow loading and geolocating (15-20 seconds, if at all) — very slow with WiFi download at decent 75 Mbps and Verizon the same — and glacially slow loading of the widget (geez, it’s a widget and shouldn’t take 15 seconds to load); and, (2) the watch data is likewise slow to load and, in a recurrent bug, data such as temperature NEVER changes in the watch face complication or matches the forecast; plus, no multiple locations as with native weather app on watch.  All latest hardware and software. Not jail broken.  Very disappointing by developers.  This will be my last subscription on iPhone and iMac."
"10741",1057145653,"Very fun and enjoy it.The commercials kill the Emerson though.Ill be buying the ad free for sure.I do enjoy this game."
"10742",1057145653,"This game is the most fun of all time in the world"
"10743",1057145653,"Very fun to play."
"10744",1057172667,"This game is very fun recommend"

"10747",1057340661,"Love this game! Such cute graphics and challenging too. Xmas all year long!"
"10748",1057340661,"I play this game daily. Love it"
"10749",1057340661,"I’m hooked! It hung during some ads, but after upgrading - no problems."
"10750",1057391061,"I love you it's super entertaining!!!"
"10751",1057391061,"Can be a bit hard to learn but gets better if you stick it out and some of the skins are great."
"10752",1057391061,"Hehdjdjdjdndndnd"
"10753",1057403847,"This game is awesome only that so many rocks that i can’t get all of them"
"10754",1057403847,"This game was good before the updates, if you stack up a bunch of balls then smash em all off at once the counter won't count even half of them... this game is obviously rigged to bait you into buying bombs"
"10755",1057403847,"I’m so glad I have the best game ever it is so amazing it xplods my mind always makes my world a perfect man"
"10756",1057415516,"Good"
"10757",1057415516,"It keeps kicking me off as soon as I get on the game"
"10758",1057415516,"Hehshsjshsjsjahah"
"10759",1057415521,"This is an awesome game! But, it’s basically impossible to get diamonds without watching ads! Can you please make a new way to get diamonds? Thanks- SpaceFam"
"10760",1057415521,"It's a pretty good game. Recommended."
"10761",1057415521,"It’s ok but um it’s to hard to get money and that’s it that I have trouble with but for the most time I’m fine"
"10762",1057416982,"Hi"
"10763",1057416982,"Fun addicting simple"

"10765",1057446665,"勉强合格吧！现在交行信用卡外币还款直到最后一天才知道具体数目，我常年在国外，有时差，怕晚了！"
"10766",1057446665,"过于臃肿，有很多不必要的功能，只有信用卡余额查询功能有用，其余功能都没什么用，人心不足蛇吞象，产品经理不要想着做集成，多去国外软件学习，做好一项功能就行了"

"10768",1057510303,"It is a scam and I don’t like it.it is boooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnngggggggg"
"10769",1057510303,"Loves  this  game"
"10770",1057510303,"Don’t buy this app I am warning you this app doesn’t even deserve 1 star it deserves none. Everything is locked, you have to draw it and it’s really hard. I hate this app!"
"10771",1057554325,"Why? Because I’m addicted to it and it’s great much better than other train games sooo I’m rating it 5 stars if I could rate it to 10 I would do that anyways I like this game!!!!"
"10772",1057554325,"It’s fun"
"10773",1057554325,"Cute graphics and holds my attention, awesome job!"
"10774",1057556336,"I started with the light version and then found that my 19 month old learned how to put the colored circles into the right holes.  He loves playing this game and he becomes so proud (as do I) every time he makes a match.  I wish there was a way to stay on a given level instead of forced progression though."
"10775",1057556336,"My little daughter loves the app"
"10776",1057556336,"Great app! My kids love it."
"10777",1057633985,"This game is very fun and enjoyable but it always crashes and soft locks constantly."
"10778",1057633985,"Anyone ready to pay for getting ""eraser"" and Redo button?"
"10779",1057633985,"This would be a great app if there were some way to export the models."
"10780",1057673686,"The first time I played it it wouldn't let me finish the main game.  This time I was on a plane and managed to play the main part but cannot finish the bonus game. The story was ok but not as good as the other Grim Tales games. If you buy it however, be prepared to play the whole thing in one sitting though."
"10781",1057673686,"I touch the screen and it doesn’t do anything."
"10782",1057673686,"All the important things - map, characters, graphics, etc. u expect, but I am writing this because I'm thoroughly enjoying myself!  I'll come back later,  but, for now, just have fun!"
"10783",1057844059,"Love this game, this game is perfect in between breaks at work and during lunch.   Thank you !"
"10784",1057844059,"You kill zombie  and I like it there’s some challenges and I love it"
"10785",1057844059,"Awesome game 💯"
"10786",1057870288,"Fun"
"10787",1057870288,"I got this game yesterday and it was an immediate hit for me and my friends. We all got this on our iPhones (6S) and it was a really addictive time waster. But then I tried to play it this morning and suddenly, it kept crashing. IDK why, so I texted my friends to see if they had the same problem. They checked their phone and sure enough, same thing. I really hope you guys fix this, because soon enough, the crash is going to be on all phones. This game is great overall and has potential, but I can never play it now since it always crashes."
"10788",1057870288,"I feel like they’re are tons of ads and lag.First time I got the game it crashed and redo downloaded.I have and Iphone 7 so it’s not my phone and I have good wifi and tons of space. I know the ads can be fixed by turning off the WiFi but the game can’t handle other apps running in the back."
"10789",1057889290,"The energy thing is stupid and it is just a way to make money. That is the only bad thing that they should change."
"10790",1057889290,"This is the best game I’ve ever had"
"10791",1057889290,"Good for entertainment"
"10792",1057925633,"I like the game but you start to get lonely please add online so you can play with friends add them as a friend. communicate with them to please"
"10793",1057925633,"It's a very good game! If you have a very smol phone then it may be stuffy. But you'll get used to the game. It's very fun! I think it's worth the money. If you download this game and you think it's good write a review! I hope everyone will think it's a good game even more then good FANTASTIC! Although I think they should add stuff.       1. They should add where you can name the world.  Anything but that it's 100%! 💗💗 Love you toca boca! I think this is a good game and I'm only 7! Anyway great game 👍!"
"10794",1057925633,"The app is amazing 5/5 love it. So much to do and create. I just this when you enter through teleporting doors the worlds should be different. But anyway I wanted to give a suggestion for an app. I call it Toca Worlds. Your a little character who starts out on a planet (that you would name) and you get to create it. You get in a spaceship and explore more planets, and collect stuff from those plantets like aliens and just materials and bring them back to your planet and expirement with them to make objects and cool things to decorate your planet with and use throughout the game. You should be able to meet new creatures too.I think that would be so cool! Thank you, love your games so much and I think this game would be so good. 😁😄😄"
"10795",1057961675,"I hate this game I’m sorry but I’ve deleted and downloaded this game 5 times I was hoping that you fixed the glitches but you haven’t so I just can’t play the game"
"10796",1057961675,"I think it needs more coins through out the maps so you can actually progress without wasting a whole lot of time, the graphics are better than hill climb but honestly not worth it to play."
"10797",1057961675,"Cool games"
"10798",1058023292,"I enjoyed it"
"10799",1058023292,"I liked this game.  It was certainly long enough for the cost, and the bonus game that came with it with fairly extensive as well.  Plot was good as well, which is not always true with these games.  about the only thing i didn't like was a minigame in the bonus section which is a side-scroller.  the controls were really terrible and frustrating."
"10800",1058023292,"Things one finds actually make sense, good story line, good hints. Only complaint is that the text is so small."
"10801",1058036662,"Can't get past the name screen. Which is too bad because this looks like a cool game."
"10802",1058036662,"Can’t start the game. This is a rip-off! I demand my money back, no such thing as free money!!!"
"10803",1058036662,"Paid for it because there isn’t a preview. Can’t even type in my name. Doesn’t work at all. Would like a refund."
"10804",1058355648,"I am addicted to this game and cannot stop playing! This game is the best game to learn how to drive and to stay inside the lines while driving. (To the Developer:) I wish you could add more cars and different weather driving conditions. And as well the cars are buggy and need to be fixed. There needs to be updates as well. But all looks good and the game is really fun!!!!"
"10805",1058355648,"This is a bad crsed game my chld wated this and I said sure my child the next day she that died this game cursed"
"10806",1058355648,"Honestly this game is pretty fun, the two things that I hate about it is the steering and the CONSTANT ADS literally anything I clicked on I had to watch a Ad before I could go to that menu"
"10807",1058370552,"I enjoy this game.  Gets harder as you go to higher levels.  I have found a few levels are tough without buying coins. Give it a try if you enjoy match three games. All I can say is that the game is  challenging and is lots of fun.  Good as a brain game.  Hooked on this one!"
"10808",1058370552,"Does not give my coins after quest!!"
"10809",1058370552,"This game has several bugs.  Looking at other reviews, several people have sited several.  The latest is the reward challenges for bonuses doesn’t award once challenge completed.  It says claim prize and when you hit the button.  The prize disappear and not awarded.  Yet the challenges still keep showing up."
"10810",1058526204,"I haven’t been getting any bots lately"
"10811",1058526204,"If you like transformers then you will like the game. After all that's what the game is about ""Transformers "". However since the game is about transformers why not spend a little of your hard earned $$ to get by our favourite bot? Well that spot the way this game works. From the bugs and randomness of the game you be other except it or move on. Bugs range from abilities bot working right to plain old bathing problems. Bots will wonder off or will attack walls. Better still is the commander setting a rush point and the bots totally ignore it. The bots ""appear"" when you get a crystal and pop it in tge space bridge. Well 1% of tge time you will get a bit you need. The others are duplicate or just some crap you already have. Free crystals give you more boosts than the usable stuff and the way the system works you are better off just not using them because they do not help in war. Some people will read this and say this person is way off but I played 3 years before I finally just gave it up adept this review. No more of my time or $$ on this game. So do yourself a favour and go to another game."
"10812",1058526204,"I’m a huge fan"
"10813",1058528141,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY A LOT OF HACKERS... this game steel your money and the hackers kick you out the game all the time when you destroy their tanks."
"10814",1058528141,"Unexpectedly addictive and fun."
"10815",1058528141,"My phone crashed. Got a new one.   Lost my rank. Tank. Coins. Everything. Contacted WM’s. Just got an add as a result.  Not satisfied. Also. The review posted in the app is a year old. Looks like the developers don’t care."
"10816",1058602106,"I paid to be able to save my progress because I felt like the game was worth it. honestly I love everything about this game, ESPECIALLY the storyline. Unfortunately, I can’t give this app a 5 star review because of the absolute lack of technical support. About a week ago, the audio from the game disappeared. Absolute silence. Considering the fact that the audio is arguably one of the most important  aspects of game, it was pretty upsetting to have lost it. when I searched for technical support there actually wasn’t any. I was directed to the adult swim site which directed me back to the app. Seriously guys? I just want my audio back, some instruction, guidance, ANYTHING. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and ALL MY PROGRESS WAS LOST. WHAT THE F$&@?! Can anybody help me out?!?!"
"10817",1058602106,"I would give this a zero star rating if I could. You got me interested in this game then you threw down that we have to pay to keep our progress. Now I'm just mad. I'm going to delete this game immediately. Next time make one that's completely free And I might be interested. Ugh"
"10818",1058602106,"So its kinda cool that you can literally play this game from start to finish in 1 go. Unfortunately it will take up the whole day.  The comedy is very good especially the creators and the teacher level i got a kick out of.   If i do get enough to buy it, i will because i never did any of the extras."
"10819",1058603368,"This game is fantastic.  Especially great when you just need a quick brain stimulation.  It's easy to play and definitely tests what kinda risks you're willing to take.  Try it, it's fun!"
"10820",1058603368,"This game is boring at the beginning but the end is the most fun part."
"10821",1058603368,"Really fun game, for those complaining you have to start over from the beginning, that's part of the challenge. It starts slow and as it gets faster and adds more obstacles it becomes more challenging gradually. Wish it had a paid version to get rid of the adds though."
"10822",1058709520,"The top of my screen is covered so I can’t see my progress and it’s really inconvenient so I would like if it were fixed but besides that it’s a good game."
"10823",1058709520,"This is one of the best games I have ever played"
"10824",1058709520,"Good Game GG"
"10825",1058747457,"I love big bus games they’re so cool😘😘 and I can play any game I want to I love them so much whoever made them good job🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍🍅🍅🥔🥔🥬🥬"
"10826",1058747457,"this game is so fun beacause I like dumplings and dumplings were added to the game. Thx and bye"
"10827",1058747457,"Frist I thought well I’m seeing theses dumb apps but once I opened up the app I love it😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 and asmr peoplezzzz i you can record this on your phone DO ITT"
"10828",1058801458,"Super large I like the different beats and drums that you can do for my my friend Jenna to explore because she really likes music and she’s a super DJ fan and that’s what she wants to be when she grows up and it just makes me feel really good about myself and sometimes when I’m mad or my friends are mad I just plus them if I’m at my house to play on my iPad and I say play this game and it’s called Remixlive and it’s super fun and you get to DJ and it’s really valuable to play on and asked me on a seven-year-old and I can I probably should like it because it just helps me express my feelings"

"10833",1058952530,"I kind a like this game so great I hope you make more of these games"
"10834",1058959277,"Terrible to be honest"
"10835",1058959277,"Uber is really bad. Really bad, especially now that they are wallstreet. Really bad. Sad."
"10836",1058959277,"This is the most apoplectic app I have eve encountered. Please do not ever use Uber, they are a horrible business with worse customer service"
"10837",1058965051,"I read the reviews that said this game needs a map, but I don’t usually use the map so I didn’t pay much attention. This game really does need a map. Their isn’t much (or any) guidance about what to do next, and the hint button only works if you are in the right location already. The HOPs and mini games are fun, but overall the game is frustrating. I’m finding myself just trying to get through it as quickly as possible."
"10838",1058965051,"I enjoyed playing Eclipse.  It has an excellent length, good graphics, and some interesting puzzles.  On the other hand, it can be really annoying.  My biggest annoyance is the absence of a map.   There is no way to determine what is next and no way to transport to the next place.  As a result, I have spent endless amounts of time wandering aimlessly.  The hint button might has well have been absent since the only thing it tells you is ""you can't do anything here.""  While the strategy guide is excellent, you have to restart the game every time you use it. (And Big Fish needs to stop dumping multiple ads into its web site!) Overall, I'd give it a 3-star rating."
"10839",1058965051,"Good game but it is okay. No map. I have to use hint on where to find next."
"10840",1059134258,"端的にまとめられていて、分かりやすく、作りやすい。"

"10844",1059195733,"This really works for me. I’m centered, peaceful and smiling because the soul eaters can’t p*ss all over my serenity ;-)  I like that I can choose how long a meditation session lasts. Plus, I really appreciate that he’s expanded the YouTube version"
"10845",1059195733,"I first saw this in book form while house sitting. I liked it so much I posted it on FB an a friend said she loved the app. An APP? I got this immediately. I need to figure out how to gift it!"
"10846",1059213655,"Videos cause it to crash, imported 4 photos and it gave me a circle on the screen and stayed there for 3 min and nothing happened. Worthless."
"10847",1059213655,"I purchased this app to make gifs out of photos on my phone, only to find that when you import photos it completely jumbled the order with NO way to edit it! I figured it must be a bug so I went to the “Send Feedback” option, only to find it wouldn’t let me with an error message saying I need a ‘mail account’ (whatever that means) and no options to make said account to be found. Very disappointing, these people just want your money by making you pay upfront. Get GifsArt instead— it’s free and lets you edit the timeline, and doesn’t screw up the order in the first place! Complete waste of money this app was, pretty sure the other reviews must be fake. Don’t get this app!"
"10848",1059213655,"Paid $0.99 for it and I can’t even import. I select the pics and then the OK check mark doesn’t do anything. Crap"

"10850",1059218666,"This app is my goto for flying my DJI Mavic Pro, when I need to use the mission Waypoints function. And also just every day flight. I just hope you guys open up your app for the Autel EVO?  So I will just give 4 stars."
"10851",1059218666,"Should be an option for manual exposure in the pano settings. Whatever expo settings dialed in Litchi over rides it while doing the pano. Some of us prefer manual settings for better results."
"10852",1059302662,"whats up with that help guide??"
"10853",1059302662,"Cool game"
"10854",1059302662,"Nice game, but ads in between are annoying."
"10855",1059309490,"Why did they make this"
"10856",1059309490,"This app is the best of virtual reality, because it's the only! It's great as a joke (which is its intent) so I don't understand why there's a bunch of people down voting this app. If it's bad, that's because it's meant to be! I highly recommend someone this if they're looking for a good prank to do. Nice job, and keep up the great work!"
"10857",1059309490,"Garbage"
"10858",1059325444,"It asks for your gender location of your home and name it also had an incorrect countdown don’t thing young children should down without adult permission 😡"
"10859",1059325444,"My mom got this app three years ago so I started playing around with it and got really upset, it would say something like Santa’s sleeping in the work shop in CANADA! I hate this app it’s so boring! This is a MUST NOT DOWNLOAD.it also has non stop adds horrible😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"

"10861",1059401746,"Please fix. App shuts down after a few seconds. Luv luv this game. Over played monument valley. This a breath of fresh air. Please fix bugs so I can get to level 17"
"10862",1059401746,"The game is well constructed. However, unlike other games, the robot is destroyed by fierce machines at every turn until you solve the puzzle. The reflexes required are too challenging also, at least on my iPad. If the developers just made it a puzzle instead of a life and dismemberment situation for the robot, it would be a good game.  As it stands, I’m sorry I bought it, and I’m a big fan of monument valley, Mekorama, fix the factory, and ghost of memories (?).  When did we lose our sensitivity?"
"10863",1059401746,"The good: - the graphics - the interface - the look and feel - the puzzles - the fun!  The not so good: - crickets"
"10864",1059405547,"Would definitely play again!"
"10865",1059405547,"This game is probably one of the best games out there the contents are exactly the same as the ad shows and really addicting 5 stars ⭐️"
"10866",1059405547,"I just started playing this game. I'm really confused with the purpose of Green Gables. You spend hours slapping the slugsand you barely progress. I'm contemplating deleting this game!!"
"10867",1059407278,"Ok what. Why haven’t you updated this I mean omg UPDATE it pls pls pls pls   Katie ❤️"
"10868",1059407278,"This game really needs an update.It needs to connect to the others, get new characters, get more clothes, and stay the same season it actually is. PLEASE UPDATE"
"10869",1059407278,"This game needs to be connected to the other apps. It would be really cooler if it connected."
"10870",1059442774,"It's pretty limited what you can do with this app; it w ups have saved Douglas Coupland a lot of time, but for most people this is going to be a gimmick tried a few times and then forgotten"
"10871",1059442774,"I Think that the program would be a lot more efficient with an iPad version. That being said it's a lot of fun to play with."
"10872",1059442774,"Ok app that take 3-5mins to render video uses 5%of battery on 5c &10%on 6..👎🏾"
"10873",1059443303,"I really like the graphics!!!"
"10874",1059443303,"awesome"

"10876",1059536022,"You failed to advise the Popmoney/Zelle customers that the auto conversion from Popmoney to Zelle was only on the VYSTAR side.  The Popmoney Recipient of my transfers needs to do something, but at this point I’m not sure what.  Also, you did the implementation on Tuesday morning.  I’ve been implementing banking software for years and we always do the installs on Saturday night into Sunday morning. Bill pay was do win until late morning."
"10877",1059536022,"This won't use the touch ID like the iPhone version and you can't enter cents (.00) into a transfer amount!  Come on Vystar, you're a great bank, get it together."
"10878",1059536022,"When opening app it states I need to update. Try to go there and goes to OPEN. Click that and back to need to update. Over and over. Please fix it."
"10879",1059554895,"This game is super fun and addicting but there are a lot of adds and for me it glitches a lot"
"10880",1059554895,"It is a very good game and it is challenging and fun, sometimes if the ball is close to the platform it is hard to tell where the ball is but overall it is a very good game"
"10881",1059554895,"So good I love it"
"10882",1059593339,"To be taken off of the Apple Store.  I can’t believe how much the quality control has decade with Apple.  How are none working games allowed here?  Free doesn’t make it ok."
"10883",1059593339,"Have to open goggles to activate the game!!!!"
"10884",1059593339,"I bought this because it says right in the details that a controller is not needed. I cannot start the game without opening my VR set and tapping my phone... So basically a lie, you need a controller to start it"
"10885",1059604202,"It’s not exclusively pay to play. You can grind your way up and get to the top for free. Fun game and lots of game modes. Would like to see some special ops and possibly even target practice but other than that, it’s awesome"
"10886",1059604202,"The only thing that would make me play this game was its great for me .  And I hope you like it too."
"10887",1059604202,"This game is amazing, seriously well done, have you guys considered adding attack class aircraft for close air support operations, it would be awesome to see planes like the A-10, if not it’s cool, this game is phenomenal all the same"
"10888",1059622588,"If you want to play this game be ready to sit through ads every 10 sec"
"10889",1059622588,"I don't know if I would keep it on my phone it need more thing on it ????"
"10890",1059622588,"I haven't played this yet. But I know it's childish of me. But I can't get over the name of the app😂😂😂"
"10891",1059634715,"The options to view accounts and alter settings is not on the mobile app. What kind of handicapped apes program and update this heap of garbage?   Oh, you’ve logged in from this device a thousand times, but now your account is locked. We have no reason for this; We’re just morons who can’t program.   Welcome back, signing in with thumbprint?  sorry, can we Call or Text you for the one billionth time? Just have to make sure! Couldn’t possibly STILL be you!   Who would possibly need to see their entire account numbers, and why not put the option available clearly? Doubt they’d ever need to transcribe these without digging through the cancerous e-statements.   Your app is on par with your employees.  GOOD DAY, SIR OR MADAM"
"10892",1059634715,"So when I try to use Touch ID to log on it tells me my account is locked. But then when I just enter my account name and password it works. Please explain why this keeps happening. Touch ID used to work great. Not sure what’s going on now."
"10893",1059634715,"Reason why many people don’t like this app is because its such a plain app and you can’t transfer externally, it would be awesome for it to be updated and have a better sense of wanting to actually use the app"

"10898",1059665257,"The people glitch into each other and you have to make it more realistic in every way. When you hit it, make it look like a line drive not a pop up every time. Fix the characters and when you get a power hit, when it pops up like an orange blast, it should be a hit every time."

"10912",1059911569,"I’ve played all the free games so finally tried this paid game. While I think the game is worth the small cost, it’s somewhat disappointing.   The logic puzzles in “hotel” seem simpler and more straightforward than in the free games. What’s frustrating is how much the ordering of events is relevant to getting a top score. The result is that beating the game involves a lot of rote repetition to order your actions optimally. This makes the game last longer but at a cost of tedium, particularly because the ordering is arbitrary and not clued in any way. In particular there’s at least one instance (2nd guest meal if done in correct order) where an item is required twice in order to get a perfect score - but one of the two actions makes the item unusable. So those two actions have to be done twice, for no reason other than arbitrary choice. (If the item remaine available to be picked up again, ordering wouldn’t matter.)"
"10913",1059911569,"These storylines are simple depraved.   Read some of the other critical reviews of these apps.  I enjoy these types of puzzle apps, but this one crosses the line of decency.    Personally, I would hope apple would remove the app from the app store."
"10914",1059911569,"So much fun.Not always easy and frustrating when you miss something and have to start from the beginning but absolutely brilliant. I’d rather pay for the ones that have ads but I get folk need to make money. Hurry up though. I’ve played them all and need a new one!"
"10915",1060062637,"It’s pay to play eventually, early on. I’m on level 8 and it’s too hard to win. The enemies are overwhelming. Not sure why people are rating at 4.1. It has a lot of potential but it gets difficult quickly and there are no ways to advance in cash, silver to upgrade, etc. You have to pay and I’m not going to....DELETE ** Also, it’s the wrong screen format for the iPad Pro 12.9"
"10916",1060062637,"I have just downloaded Today and found out this game doesn’t support full screen on my I Pad 10.5. the area of left and right side is missing, so i can see it only partially. please update ! thanks"

"10929",1060103787,"Keep it up great game :D"
"10930",1060178390,"It reminds me of NES days when gameplay was more important than graphics. The pixel art is amazing though, don't get me wrong. The pets, crafting, battles, are all solid. Well done! One of my favorite ios games already."
"10931",1060178390,"This game is fun but some of the enemies are annoying like the living lava and can we get more classes to play with like a monk or a barbarian"
"10932",1060178390,"Game is def worth the purchase. 🥰"
"10933",1060276201,"I like white theme like mac. i want choice color in option."
"10934",1060276201,"Terrifying. Necessary. It’s probably easier than you think. Getting out of flow state is my problem, weirdly enough. Once I start writing, I get in such a compulsive state of flow, I can’t make myself stop typing even when I want to. I use this to train myself by letting the writing fade. It’s a backwards way to use it, but it took that problem I had and neutralized it down to ...what is now, in terms of writing ... not my issue, but my edge.   But if you want to be in flow-state, just do this until you’re no longer monitoring yourself, let anything come out, and don’t feel the need to read it again. It’s a good way to purge mental clutter, to learn things you didn’t know you thought about, to get some weird poetic dream-like writing (if you’re into that) or just to see what happens. Sometimes I like to write the best thing I’ve ever written, and let it almost disappear. Don’t do that though....it’s probably not healthy lol. 😏  To do this without this app (sorry developers) use a pad and pen and try not to let the pen leave the page... or stop moving, even if you are just scribbling for a minute, it’s the same effect minus the panic attacks from the documents disappearing. This app is genius ... I wish more developers did these cool little niche interest apps. 👍🏻🙏🏻"
"10935",1060276201,"I have written in this app every day for years, on iOS and OSX, and absolutely loved it, would have given it 6 stars. When I upgraded to Mojave, the Mac app ceased to work, eating my words before it was supposed to, with no warning. Anyone know if the developer has kept up better with this iOS version?"
"10936",1060386658,"Does not work on watch which is the only reason I got it, not worth the money."
"10937",1060386658,"I have countless apps like this one. The reason I purchased this app was that I could use it across all my devices including my new AppleTV. I will always support developers that make fully universal apps when I can."
"10938",1060386658,NA
"10939",1060433597,"This is by far my favorite game like this I have so much fun playing but it’s really annoying having to wait on the ball to go back and forth. You have the mechanic with the pink spring that can be helpful but it doesn’t always work. Put in a mechanic that we can use at all times to pull the balls back and move on to the next throw. Thank you"
"10940",1060433597,"Love this game.  Because balls are so different, it would be fantastic to have a high score for each ball type as well as overall best score."
"10941",1060433597,"Gardenscapes and wordscapes ads are slowing down the game. Please stop puttin those ads"
"10942",1060443742,"I like to read an actual forecast for weather and not see a simplistic layout trying to be mod with just icons and a lot of white space devoid of any details.   A choice of a dark theme would be nice."
"10943",1060443742,"Need to add weather maps and alerts.  So close to being a great program but not quite there."
"10944",1060443742,"Description sounded good but app did not deliver. No maps, all text, no good. But I hope my $1.99 went to a good cause. Free weather apps all over the place are much, much better. Even my local TV station app is light years ahead of this."
"10945",1060599603,"For a game that takes a lot of random tapping, it crashes too much. I never knew if I was doing the wrong thing or if the game had frozen. Some of the puzzles were fun and creative. There is a lot of repetition. Three stars because it was not a total waste of time, but it needs work."
"10946",1060599603,"Good game! I love the challenges and the wordplay; the only aspect I found annoying was the limited keys/hints. Other than that, 10/10, I would play again!"
"10947",1060599603,"Entertaining game I must say definitely gotta think outside of the box 📦😂"
"10948",1060704812,"Best game ever"
"10949",1060704812,"This game can be edu cational"
"10950",1060704812,"Good game and all but you should make a permanent option to eliminate the sticker chat while playing. Hate just muting it every battle. Other than that its a great game good concept and very entertaining."
"10951",1060739646,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"10952",1060739646,"I really liked this game, I’ve been playing it for a long time now, I enjoy how it's pixelated, it adds a nice feel to it. It would be cool if you could add a melee weapon or weapons to the game as well as new monsters. Other than that I wouldn’t change anything about the game."
"10953",1060739646,"Controlling character feels good. Entertaining platforming challenges.  Nothing interesting to unlock. No sense of meaningful progress in rewards. Insufficient feedback to show player growing in skill."

"10959",1060986698,"I saw a review saying ""This is the best game I have ever played"" THATS NOT REAL"
"10960",1061009889,"I’ve done everything but nothing works"
"10961",1061009889,"I LOVE the game but I have it on my school iPad and therefore for I cannot get in app purchases and I think it would make the game better if you made it completely free. Because as I said I LOVE the game"
"10962",1061009889,"Those that love the game yet want more, giving you less than 5-stars should really discontinue reviewing games, it's not fair to the developers. You guys did such a great job with this game!! It is my favorite game in the app store. A creative masterpiece, the cleverest puzzles in classic Atari-style bit graphics, i'm LOVING IT. :D Thank you kindly for this gem. Where are these 'ads' all the frustrated people are commenting on?? I haven't seen one single ad, and thank you for that also!"
"10963",1061042798,"Addictive. Makes ad watching disturbingly appealing. And I hate ads. (However, once tried to open a weird URL in my browser; maybe glitchy with airplane mode?) Japanese only."

"10967",1061115611,"Great app packs with plenty of features. Love the player barometer and live comentary functions. really give me my best euro experience."
"10968",1061115611,"I know it's the first launch season.. I am expecting a perfect app to be built by next Euro cup.. Good layout.. Keep it up..."
"10969",1061132313,"Meh. This game I only reviewed bc u asked. One moment please. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  I  AM  A  POTATO  Oh hi mark"

"10973",1061143997,"Coool"
"10974",1061143997,"Unplayable. I wish I can enjoy this game. A 30 second ad at the end of every round is completely BS. Where is the option to purchase and remove ads?"
"10975",1061197325,"Straight. Up. Garbage."
"10976",1061197325,"The game is amazing but the Royals don’t have players like Ben Zobrist or Alex Rios other then that the game is amazing!"
"10977",1061197325,"3 years later it is still awesome"
"10978",1061224933,"I HATE this app it is horrible I can’t even animate on it do not buy I suggest you buy something like KineMaster that helps me a lot to animate and it ACTUALLY WORKS"
"10979",1061224933,"Hi! I think this is a great app for those who like to draw and bring characters to life! Despite it’s little issues its a great app. I was first introduced to this app in school, we were doing a coding section, and our library teacher told us to download this app. And from then on I’ve been using this app a lot!  (Keep up the good work!❤️)"
"10980",1061224933,"I was looking for an app that can help me animate and I came cross to this and thought I would try it since I love what you guys create but I was kinda disappointed when it tested it , it’s not like other animations app I’m thinking that maybe you could adjust things a bit like do things like other animation apps have and use but better only if you want to ( so : FlipaClip , medipant , and etc ) and maybe you could add tutorials so that way me and others won’t get confused and we can improve our art if others need it"
"10981",1061501834,"No stars for this."
"10982",1061501834,"App will close by itself. Iphone X"
"10983",1061501834,"How do u add music?!?!?! ....the only thing I know is how to add a playlist. How come nothing (no music) is shown? How come you can't search for a song and download it or add it to a playlist? HELP PLZZZ"
"10984",1061550054,"I think that you have to pay like a dollar 💵 to get no adds"
"10985",1061550054,"First of all you can no do anything, Second of all that is really stupid because like there’s nothing to do and there’s too many ads and please change the girls They all smiles same and it makes no sense how when you decide to sometimes get all of the things and it doesn’t let you you just have the same things you begin with and tab tale if you’re reading this we don’t all just have money 😒"
"10986",1061550054,"First of all the black tear in the eye makeup is inappropriate! Second of all, the game doesn't serve its purpose because you can't do the tour bus or the live show unless you PAY! It's just plain horrible. If I could rate it zero stars I would."
"10987",1061572339,"Pretty good game but I don't like when you have to pay to get to level 6.But still it's pretty good."
"10988",1061572339,"It is a really fun app until you get to level 6, then they make you buy the full version! It stinks! I would say to get this app and then delete it. You will have a good time but you can't get to level 6"
"10989",1061572339,"Some mans voice was voicing over the kids music while the kids were playing this app. You could hear him talking about a YouTube music review. It finally ended but creeped me out so much I deleted."
"10990",1061572575,"IF YOU WANT TO BUY 11 TO 20 DO NOT IT IS THE SAME THING 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"10991",1061572575,"But if their games are free they will be five stars but a half of the game is you have to pay for so that why I didn’t but you five stars but if you did the game free it’s will be awesome and every person on the world will be downloaded you game thanks and good bye 😘"
"10992",1061572575,"Ok guys I love 💕 this game. It’s super fun🤣! But after level 1-10 it basically shows the same levels again just V.I.P I guess🤨. You have to buy it. Also you have to watch adds to get literally every level😟. It’s ok I guess. BYE🤩!!!!"
"10993",1061610336,"So this is a HORRIBLE game and it is for kids 4+ why?!!!! You have to pay for a lot of stuff how about everything free 😭 this is a game for 67+ and I hate this game so much!!! Thanks for putting this game on Tab tale 😒"
"10994",1061610336,"You can do 6 out of 8 things you just can’t do lost and found and the gossiping one"
"10995",1061610336,"In this game I love the way that it is played."
"10996",1061703886,"I like the app but they keep putting these dang on ads in when I'm playing y'all need to stop with the adds in the middle of the game"
"10997",1061703886,"Pretty good game. But in the middle of a game an ad will pop up and you loose. It also takes up a lot of battery. If you try to close out of an ad it'll take you to the App Store."
"10998",1061703886,"This game is so stupid and on a iPhone 6s it's really small for me"
"10999",1061724021,"Sería bueno mandar solo ver a quien le gusto y ver de quien soy favorito"
"11000",1061724021,"A great app to make new friends I really enjoy this app"
"11001",1061724021,"So much happy for have you"
"11002",1061733193,"The play format is like AOD (Army Of Darkness) and a few other similar games like Samurai Defense.  I’ve always been good at that type of game.  I like that the battles are not drawn out endlessly. With timing, strategy and skill needed to consistently win it keeps you engaged. I am Champion “Wimpy Wizard” can you beat me?"
"11003",1061733193,"This game is my favorite I love crushing my enemies and ranking up My best team is a⭐️⭐️ robot tower ⭐️⭐️Sheila bot ⭐️⭐️⭐️ black knight ⭐️⭐️⭐️ thrasher ⭐️⭐️⭐️ archer and a ⭐️⭐️ terminus 900"
"11004",1061733193,"I have been playing this game for several months and it’s a fun game.  However, every time I win I’m unable to get the 2x coin bonus. I win then I choose the option for 2x coin bonus and watch the video all the way through.  When the video is done I exit out and it takes me back to the end of the game I won and freezes there.  I have never gotten the 2x coin bonus!  And every single time I try to find help for this I’m taken to pages that are unavailable or insecure.  Not happy at all!"
"11005",1061782177,"It will not let me open the game at all"
"11006",1061782177,"The app is cool fun and addicting with is cool this is not a robot by the way or what ever you call the fake accounts"
"11007",1061782177,"If you're here because you want free Yeezy's or whatever, stop now. Kanye has not endorsed this nor has he developed this game. It's all a sham that spam accounts use to get downloads. Plus the game is trash."
"11008",1061802598,"I dislike this game and I want a refund now! But unfortunately I can’t get a refund because it won’t let me!"
"11009",1061802598,"Great port, I can’t find anything wrong with the port. Classic!"
"11010",1061802598,"Please everything with this game is fine we need the finish the final one now"
"11011",1061859052,"Dosent work on IPhone XR, there goes 3$"
"11012",1061859052,"I am mad because it doesn’t work on my home screen 😡 and I really want it to work on my home screen"
"11013",1061859052,"How do you get it to be live cus I used the instructions and it didn’t work"
"11014",1061897092,"It’s horrible no one should download it its boring i though it would be a better game but NO"
"11015",1061897092,"Is so much fun 😀"
"11016",1061897092,"I really think that it’s ok because like you only get one girl. Like literally. And plus you can’t bathe her. And she can’t even play with her friends and go other places because we have to PAY FOR It. Like we need money for important things not just app."
"11017",1061907653,"I like how you get to do all these things with your ballerina and I’m annoyed with the eyeshadow and the picture of your ballerina 💍"

And the beauty and time you put in the game coco plays game sorry I forget your game name a lot but I love y’all games by the way keep up with the good work"
"11020",1061909513,"You try to get to the other half .well you need to pay so    I had to delete my  favorite game."
"11021",1061909513,"DO NOT BUT THUS GAME IT IS SO STUPID"
"11022",1061909513,"This is the best app ever .😁"
"11023",1061912080,"We love this game I I bought is the game yesterday and I am rich spend the Any 100K"
"11024",1061912080,"Just fixed some bugs.And add new features."
"11025",1061912080,"This is a bad soccer version of subway surfer it is actually the same thing"
"11026",1061931703,"Listen him well."
"11027",1061931703,"Very happy with this app!"
"11028",1061931703,"Good"
"11029",1061960628,"My only gripe with the game is its only one act so far!  It works the old school vibe so well I thought it was an old game redone for ipad!  The no hand holding is extreme, just the way I like it!  However having a option to turn on the ""hint"" system permanently would be a good move for ppl who didn't grow up playing these kinds of games.  There are a few points were you can get stuck if you miss something, but as long as you stick with it and think it through, you'll get it!   There are some small bugs(characters pics will sometimes not show up in the frame when they're talking, for example)  but nothing that got in the way of finishing the game.     One more thing, I wish the new game button was farther, or underneath or something(!) from the continue one, I accidentally restarted my game three times, once when I was halfway thru  😖  very frustrating!"
"11030",1061960628,"Beautiful, but: Buggy Super short (45m)"
"11031",1061960628,"Not long but reasonable length, interesting story. I will definitely watch for the sequel. Took me a while to find the elevator button in the very beginning, after that I rarely got stuck by not finding something to tap. Jo, did you search the bathroom?"
"11032",1061999170,"Literally all I have to say is the controls are not sensitive enough. Add an option to change the dead zone."
"11033",1061999170,"This is a game that takes 10 seconds to learn, but can be played forever. Super impressed. Monetization is not too egregious either. Five stars"
"11034",1061999170,"I loved this game but I got bored of it for a while so I uninstalled it but I kept wanting to play the game so I went into the App Store to redownload it but I realized I forgot the name and I have finally found it as we speak"
"11035",1062002361,"How can I edit if I can’t even split a video??"
"11036",1062002361,"4K editors are difficult to find and this one answers the call for professionals on the go..."
"11037",1062002361,"I like everything thus far. If you all could add a blur effect to blur out certain items in the clips, like car tags or anything else you may not want exposed in a video, that would be great!"
"11038",1062006344,"Nice app & Fun but they need to fix colors fading"
"11039",1062006344,"I’m sorry the cost to color with this app is outrageous. After all it’s just supposed to be adult coloring right?  Spend your money on a real coloring book, some crayons and colored pencils and be happy coloring for a lot less money."
"11040",1062006344,"I know it says cancel anytime but why not allow the free trial without the auto renew."
"11041",1062166395,"I admit there were times I would watch an ad to get another chance or a revive on an auto death but since I paid for a boost that is NO LONGER AN OPTION?? I’m losing an assist because I paid. Well forget that. SO UNHAPPY NOW."
"11042",1062166395,"Keep running out of levels and takes weeks to get new ones"
"11043",1062166395,"Lots of fun and my nickname is TBEAR!!!"
"11044",1062168249,"I have been trying for several days to get on server 18 but it never works."
"11045",1062168249,"Pretty good"
"11046",1062168249,"This app is just a cover to steal your money! In app purchases are a joke and Joyfort, the developers know this and hope that if they ignore your complaints long enough you’ll go away! I highly recommend you steer way clear of anything with Joyfort as a developer!"
"11047",1062307524,"So, if there are any video editors wondering if they should buy it do not. It is pretty good for picture editing though."
"11048",1062307524,"As a Star Wars nerd, this is a great and easy app to use, very fun and addicting! The only thing I think would make this better would be the ability to erase the sabers you add, or if you had a saber passing through something!"
"11049",1062307524,"Bull crap. Worst app I have ever downloaded."
"11050",1062318595,"The movement feels just too floaty. Also the virtual dpad takes up too much space so when trying to move to shots on the left it becomes difficult to see. It didn’t try the touch controls because I want something similar to arcade controls like virtua tennis."
"11051",1062318595,"It’s a bad game"
"11052",1062318595,"This game is very fun but I feel it’s time for a new season with new changes. After playing for a while it can get boring and I found myself losing interest for the career mode. I wish there was a tournament in the career mode for the olympics and I also wish that the career mode could be more realistic and hands on."
"11053",1062475106,"this has been a consistent issue for the year and a half that I've had this app and I've tried saying something before but nothing changed. overall I love this app but I really wish that this would get fixed"
"11054",1062475106,"😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱"
"11055",1062475106,"For $0.99 I wasn’t expecting much, but I was expecting it to at least show up on my watch.  After uninstalling and reinstalling it still did show up at all in the watch app."
"11056",1062642163,"You have to be observant with this game. I just live it."
"11057",1062642163,"One word to describe this game - outstanding. This is my first Glitch game and if they are all this well made, I am excited to play all the rest! The graphics are great, gameplay is smooth, puzzles are very challenging, yet fun, and the game is just a super fun game. I’ve been playing for 3 hours straight and I’m not even close to being finished. If you are looking for a fun and challenging point and click, escape type game with good puzzles, give this game a try. You will totally LOVE it.  Edit: I just played A Short Tale AGAIN and it was just as fun as the first time I played it. I absolutely love this cute game."
"11058",1062642163,"A Short Tale is the 6th Glitch Game that I have played, and it is one of their best. The puzzles were a nice balance between clever and fiendish, with a few being maybe a little too close to fiendish. (I am looking at you Magic 8 Ball!) I liked the change in tone from the darker elements of Forever Lost, as this game is one that I would let my younger kids try out. I also thought the smaller environment within one room was a nice change of pace as it meant that you did not have to travel far to investigate a new clue or to search for the next clue. Looking forward to more offerings from Glitch."
"11059",1062745479,"Interface is much improved and easier to digest now"
"11060",1062745479,"Excellent Application"
"11061",1062745479,"Love this app, all of the info is so useful.  I have a few health issues and this helps me track and record any issues or progress I may have."
"11062",1062765947,"It’s a great relaxing game to play"
"11063",1062765947,"I love this game so much!! It's one of my favorite apps. The graphics are adorable and it's not glitchy at all. The characters are cute and the game is very addicting. I play it all the time but my only concern is that the orca whale character is reversed when used. Again, I also find it slightly annoying that you get extra coins when getting a high score. Thanks for reading!"
"11064",1062765947,"When I started this game I was so happy I don't think any game will past this game I love it so so much please do other ones like this.❤️❤️"
"11065",1062825798,"It's pretty good"
"11066",1062825798,"I just rated for the coins but it's still a good game"
"11067",1062825798,"The game is very cool but there should be a lot more cars and you should be able to change the color of the cars and mace."
"11068",1062825806,"This game makes no sense to me.👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺"
"11069",1062825806,"its fun at first but gets annoying and boring and the ads ugh"
"11070",1062825806,"it's pretty impossible to play, there is lag. it looks like they put a lot of effort into designing this game, but not actually testing the gameplay."
"11071",1062834129,"Awesome arcade games!!! Reminds me of puzzle fighter"
"11072",1062834129,"This game is a puzzle game in which you struggle to not enjoy the art so you don't explode from incompetence.  Pros:  The art is really good at being simple, recognizable, and humorous. (If you get to look at it for more than the split second it allows) The animation is simple and effective (which you won't notice because you are busy looking at the cars) There is a surprising array of cars on display. From the VW party bus to the Bugatti, the sprites in this game do an accurate depiction of famous vehicles.   Cons: If you struggle with pattern recognition you will not enjoy this game. Tight time limits make finding the cars on this ever changing board a challenge. Not to mention you can't even enjoy your robot punching a huge plant-crab-fish-Dino in the eye :( Customizing your robot does not change the cars on the board or abilities you use. You will skip Cutscenes, especially the combining one in every level.  This game is worth the .99 it asks for, however it probably will not keep you for very long."
"11073",1062834129,"REMOVE THE ADS. Unacceptable."
"11074",1062945251,"This app reminds me to begin my day with gratitude. It sets the tone for the day. The evening reminder creates a practice of finding the moments to be grateful for even on a challenging day."

"11076",1062945251,"This is so much handier & easier to keep up with than a paper journal plus you never run out of room or paper!😍"
"11077",1063149922,"I love this game. Would easily get 5 stars if they would fix a problem in all the reindeer drop screens. If you solve it on the last hand, it registers as a loss, not a win. The reindeer screen is the only place I’ve found that this happens. Also, App support doesn’t get you anywhere or I would have reported it. Like many others, I appreciate that you don’t get stuck on a level forever. That makes the game enjoyable. Many other games I’ve dropped for that one reason."
"11078",1063149922,"Cute game and fun.  The ads are way too distracting."
"11079",1063149922,"I love how there is a mixture of easy and more challenging levels.  I hate how most games get more challenging the higher levels you get to making me eventually delete that game.  My only complaint is I wish I could play it on my IPad horizontal or vertical.  Keep up with the mixture of hard and easy levels, love it!  I even paid to get rid of ads!  Thank you!"
"11080",1063166978,"So I like quidd and I don’t have an issue with it mostly, but they don’t have sword art online stickers! They have most common shows but shows that aren’t as well known don’t get recognition at all! I understand that it might be hard but, I don’t know maybe a function where people can make their own stickers would be nice!"
"11081",1063166978,"The game was really fun when I had it but when I deleted it and forgot the password for my account i tried to reset it and I’ve still  haven’t gotten any emails to reset it it’s been 4 months"
"11082",1063166978,"I’ve had this app for a while and it’s been great but there are a few problems and I’ll list some things I’d like to be added  -I’d like to be able to sell multiple items at once -Auto-removal of sold/expired listings. I am 12 and my mom has set the new iOS “Screen Time” limit on my phone and it takes up a lot of time to get rid of all the listings  That’s pretty much all I have say about this app and other than that I give it 4 stars and one ok hand ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👌🏻"

"11084",1063191689,"Bought out ads because I liked your game and wanted to support you. Except I’m still constantly harassed to watch ads for extra stuff. Honestly just wanted to play this game and enjoy it."
"11085",1063191689,"So don’t get me wrong the game is funny but after about 1 and a half hours it’s not that fun you see I’m going on a 10 hour trip we are driving to l a and sandiago and I’m trying to get as much games that don’t need internet as possible"
"11086",1063194066,"Can you make a new game called ultimate mythical creature simulator with Greek mythology animals with medusa and phoenix and The Minotaur can you add griffins and can you add the hippogriff can you are that three headed snake (I don’t know the name of that three headed snake but can you make a King cobra) can you add the Loch Ness monster can you add that giant spider   can you add goblins too(all these animals I wanted you to add on this new simulation game is all the animals that people can be in the game and if you can’t add  Medusa could you add fairys and if you can’t could you add skeleton birds and I’m reminding you the second time all these animals I’m asking you to add in the game are playable) now for the bosses can you add medusa as a boss can you add a hydra as a boss too and the last boss can you add the Kracken  anyways I’m giving u A idea to add this game so can you add this game please"
"11087",1063194066,"So, I think this game is overall good, though, it is a bit hard building a nest, and sometimes, when I’m being attacked, the attacker flies up to me! Anyways, the game is pretty good for wasting some time as a random bird. I recommend it  Another thing, I keep hearing people wanting a warrior cat simulator, and I’m pretty sure that can’t happen without the authors permission so, yeah"
"11088",1063194066,"I love your game but two complaints I have are: 1. Perching. Sometimes, when I get back to flying position from perching, I can’t move. It’s so annoying, and 2. Building a nest. When I have sticks in my mouth, when I try to fly back to build nest, I keep flying up. I don’t understand why. Not just that, but I have a suggestion. An “Ultimate Human Simulator”! I’ve always wanted one to come out, but every one I play, it has levels. I hate life simulator games with levels! So I would be so glad if you made one! Other than that, the game is amazing! Keep up the good work!"
"11089",1063317238,"This is a very nice game and very fun!! Except when I try to get a certain cube it gives me a totally different one😐😐"
"11090",1063317238,"This game is absolute trash the blocks fall so fast and whenever i tap my cube doesn't move please nobody install this garbage game"
"11091",1063317238,"This game has the potential to be very fun and very addicting if only they had an easy medium, difficult mode. The blocks fall way too fast, it makes it really hard to get far in the game:/ like REALLY hard lol, please make the cubes fall slower!!"
"11092",1063637102,"I purchased the heavy chopper and the price showed 0.99, but can’t figure out how I was charged just under 10$. Also the ads did not go away."
"11093",1063637102,"Can’t play unless you allow them access to your personal data."
"11094",1063637102,"This is an amazing game (and I'm kind of addicted to it) but it has its flaws...  Things to fix: 1. During (and after) a survival mode game there is no GUI... Which means that after the game it is just a blank screen and during the game there is no joystick or pause button, this can easily be fixed by double clicking the home button, swiping the game and re-entering.  2. After playing an ad (video part) it goes to a blank white screen and you are unable to do anything on screen, this can be fixed the same way as #1.  There are probably more flaws but these are the flaws that I found."
"11095",1063780668,"Goodgame"
"11096",1063780668,"This Game Is Really Good TBH (to be honest) You Should Get This Game.But It Is A Little Challenging."
"11097",1063780668,"It had 5 stars so I decided to make it less..."
"11098",1063781546,"The gameplay is great, the difficulty gradient is great, and it reminded me of two of my favorite childhood melodies!"
"11099",1063781546,"I am so thankful this app exists — it combines many of my favorite things all in one app!  ⚫️ Great Music ⚫️ Retro Graphics ⚫️ Epic Animations ⚫️ Easy, Intuitive Controls 🔘 ALL OF THE ABOVE!  The ONLY feature I wish was implemented was iCloud Sync; there have been a couple times where I have had to reset/restore my devices, and none of the data was saved.  With that, if you want to play across multiple devices — iPhone, iPad, tv — you will start from scratch on each device the first time you play; the only restored data is GameCenter achievements."
"11100",1063781546,"I’m not usually much of a rhythm game fan but this one is really fun. The game is pretty easy and relaxing to play. The songs are all classical music which adds to the serenity. I’d recommend playing this games with headphones on—the soundtrack is amazing! I really like the retro looking graphics too. The retro style is played to death in a lot of games these days but this one seems to pull it off well. If I had to change something I’d make more levels available to play for free but it still gives a nice preview of what the rest of the game is like. If you like rhythm games and classical music this is definitely worth trying out. I’d like to play the other songs at some point but I’m still mastering the first set. I look forward to seeing more updates in the future and possibly more songs."

"11110",1064093693,"So deliciously frustrating as addicting"
"11111",1064093693,"Overall, I enjoyed this game, but it has annoying bug where it sometimes will get stuck in the screen where you can choose which level to play. The workaround is to kill and relaunch the app. This happened 3 or 4 times over the course of completing the entire game. (This is on an iPad Air 2 with iOS 11.2.)  That said, I would still recommend this game to anyone who’s a fan of the genre. It has a somewhat original concept where your character can walk on any surface, and whatever surface it is currently walking on becomes “down.” The levels have a nice progression from easy to hard (but never become super difficult). I also appreciated the lack of adds and in-game purchases."
"11112",1064093693,"This is a simple and addictive game.   It is challenging enough to keep your attention.  The different challenges on each level are nice.   I want more stages please."
"11113",1064165938,"although not stimulus based questions, these trivia questions truly help get the facts stuck in your head, wonderful app👌🏼 thanks Tom Richey"
"11114",1064165938,"I started using this app a couple months before the AP Euro test, and it was effective in helping me get super solid on my timelines and ‘gotcha!’ type facts. Ended up getting a five with a combination of this app, another review guide, and making flash cards by myself."
"11115",1064165938,"Simple and effective! A great tool to review for my AP Euro year tomorrow."

"11120",1064362767,"Doesn’t work very well with iPhone X. Honestly, the variety of options that came with the HUE app were much better, and it was free. Every time I try and add a new device it just shuts me out of the program.... Not what I expected for $15.00, hopefully you guys can upgrade this a little bit, add more features like themes, even if they were additional cost to the app at least there will be a variety of choices I can go through instead of having to pick a very simple theme, and adjust the colors myself. Also, I was under the impression that this connects all devices into one app.... Maybe I misunderstood that."
"11121",1064362767,"App crashes on start up on iPhone X, 11.2.1"
"11122",1064421107,"This game is so good. It’s fun and addictive and the fact that it’s a paid app is excellent. I really enjoyed this. If you like rally games, buy this!"
"11123",1064421107,"The mechanics and physics of the game make this feel like an actual attempt at a racing game. EA made the perfect mobile racing game, the controls make sense for a phone and are easy to use. Thank you thank you EA."

"11131",1064676206,"There must be a bug. It won’t even allow me to select a photo from my album."
"11132",1064676206,"This is by far the best photo enhancement app I have ever used. It is so much better than anything else I have ever seen in automatically and intelligently making your photos BETTER not just different that there really is nothing else out there that even comes close. When I see the lower reviews I realized that sometimes the reviews are just worthless. This isn’t a goofy Snapchat filter. It’s a serious digital portrait enhancement. Nothing else comes close.  The only thing I have found to criticize is that the AI algorithm has trouble with tilted faces or faces turned too far in any one direction. Maybe some of the reviews are from people who didn’t know that? Because then the program just doesn’t do anything except affect the tint a little bit. Pick a picture where you are looking more directly at the camera and you will see the magic. Takes 10-20 years off perfectly and instantly."
"11133",1064676206,"So far it works as advertised on my iPhone 8 Plus and I haven’t had any issues except one. I had iTunes running in the background and this app turned the volume all the way down.  After closing the selfie app the volume stayed all the way down. I couldn’t figure it out and even restarted my phone. My music wasn’t playing and then I noticed the volume was minimized. I tested it and opened Selfie again and it did the same. It’s normal to attenuate or stop audio playback when camera apps are opened, but this is something that should be fixed"
"11134",1064883436,"You need to add a way to remove ads.  Most ads are not age appropriate.  It’s a shame that you’ve ruined what would be a great app with constant full screen add interruptions."

"11139",1064885978,"I only downloaded the game so I could review the reviews! Rather, I really just wanted to respond to the 3rd review post. Not including my review, there are only three other reviews total, so this is clearly something I am sure will not be relevant for many; yet here I am making it relevant by making my thoughts known! I also like to just waste font on a daily basis....so this is also fueled by my desire to waste a crap load of font by leaving amazingly helpful or not even relevant reviews of the reviews of the game! Here is my review of the reviews. None of the reviews were helpful at all, so my review will not be helpful at all when it comes to the terms of the game! But I did learn that the person who posted the 3rd review really goes overboard about the use of the word 'raped' in the 1st review that was posted. FYI-if you hope someone to die and never reproduce because they posted 'get raped' in a review, you should take a class in ""not swearing or hoping death upon other posts"", because that is kind of stupid to say since it is pretty much a given that reproduction is moot point after you die, so to say ""i hope you die and never reproduce"" is a big waste of font, and I am not a big fan of people who are habitual wasters of font; I also despise hypocrisy of all forms! I am privy of the fact that no one will ever read this post in its entirety, and thus they shall never see the waste of font I threw out into the interweb and the cyber highways of our digital world, but that is the life of a font wasting outlaw lie myself and you never know where I may show up next (or shall I say 'pop' up) or what review for an app or game I will review? Where will I waste font in my reviewing the past/prior reviews!!! Philosophy ninja OUT!!"

Before the constant updates, you used to see the planes moving now they seem to be frozen. Live planes IT’s need to do better."

"11156",1065127755,"I recognize that this is a story first that gives a glimpse of a very beautiful culture and people with rich traditions. Thank you for sharing. The game play is side scrolling. I do like the integrated story and documentary aspects of the game best."
"11157",1065127755,"I finished this game in one go during a really long plane flight. Jus tone thing: if you play it on an older iPad, the graphics are worse. Def try on a new iPad if you have one, try it anyway if you don’t."

"11169",1065289089,"This is the worst game I've ever played in my life and I've seen quite a few. The sensitivity is way too high and I cannot seem to change that and the speed on the Jets are just ridiculous you should make flying games like aircraft carrier. That's my favorite plane game."
"11170",1065354746,"This app is so amazing because you can change speed and pitch together or change the speed separately from the pitch. Although this app is great, I do have some ideas that would make this app extra amazing. First, I wish you can change the pitch separately from the speed. Last, I wish you could change the speed and pitch or change the speed and pitch separately from each other in real time while playing the audio clip.  I would very much appreciate that. I would be very thankful if you guys brought those two ideas I explained about earlier."

"11180",1065511007,"I purchased a Boom for my MacBook originally, and then after getting an iPhone I really remember that the sound quality of the Mac Application truly blew me away. I don’t like how Boom will suddenly stop working and I will hear nothing at all when changing songs or music in Spotify. It does not happen all the time, but it has happened enough to make me want to search for other apps. I want to have a seamless experience where I can smoothly transition from one song to another or pause without having to take my iPhone out and have to effectively disconnect my headphones or change the settings in Boom to get the sound to work. When I’m working and listening to music with Boom and it abruptly fails, it is a time consuming process for me to have to troubleshoot the app. If the developers can fix this, then I will absolutely purchase a subscription to Boom. Other than that, I have to say that it’s an excellent equalizer."

"11192",1065621093,"It does not explain clearly how to use the mods! I have tried everything it says to do and none of them work! Do not waste your money on this app it’s honestly Trash! This app is such a waste of time! I wasted 3 hours trying to figure out how to get the mods to work and I never did figure it out even after watching multiple YouTube videos on how to get this app to work I never figured it out! Do not download this app because you will be disappointed! 😭😡"
"11193",1065621093,"I want refund please I was looking for something else"
"11194",1065623382,"This is a really cute and humorous app. Great for kids and adults as other reviews have suggested. The problem is your child has to wait through a ""loading"" screen between each scene (and scenes only last 30 seconds or less). Furthermore, the app would (regularly) get to a loading screen and just hang there indefinitely. I had to force quit the app to get it to run again, and you have to start at the very beginning of the story each time you start the app back up (fortunately there's a menu you can access to jump to ""chapters"" in the story).  I'm giving this app a one star review because of the inability to play through without hitting the occasional indefinite load screen (and thereby having to force quit the app). I really hope they provide an update to address this soon because the app is really fun to play otherwise."
"11195",1065623382,"I played this with my granddaughter and we were both beaming. Excellent idea."
"11196",1065623382,"Kids are getting a big kick from this. Clever writing, too"
"11197",1065674928,"Very entertaining. Didn't want to stop playing!"
"11198",1065674928,"I can't remember if this was a good game or not because I played it last year. Check your purchases. When I it to open it didn't show that I had already bought it."
"11199",1065674928,"The hidden object areas are much more interesting and much more original than others that I have done. Really enjoying the game so far."
"11200",1065675607,"This is the worst game ever it’s so short not even intimidating at all what why would you even put this  this game in the App Store"
"11201",1065675607,"This game is trash the game is called the walk and when I hear that I expect a cool vr game at least something close to the plank walk for the htc vive"
"11202",1065675607,"You can’t even move don’t wast your time."
"11203",1065781769,"The app was working at first but now it want open up or let me login"
"11204",1065781769,"good"
"11205",1065781769,"I thought this was a great app because a friend of mine can only FaceTime so this is perfect. I do think they could have had more games but other than that it is great. PS no one paid me to say this."
"11206",1065810974,"I love this game but every single time it’s in heat up mode mama gets angry and has fire in her eyes why does that happen every time?"
"11207",1065810974,"I love the game. But it needs updating badly. It hasn’t been updated in 2 years."
"11208",1065810974,"Uh..."
"11209",1065834036,"The game was down for me for a week and a half but now working as it should be. I sent help request and have not heard back but game working now it just updated self."
"11210",1065834036,"It’s awesome but I cant get any cp to deploy troops. Why?"
"11211",1065834036,"Fun unique game but I lose all audio randomly playing this game from time to time. Hopefully it gets fixed because my phone requires a reboot every time I encounter this bug."
"11212",1065849294,"After completing 22 laps game closes. Has happened on other laps over the past several weeks. Waste of time because no challenge due to blacking out"

"11214",1065849294,"?"
"11215",1065906948,"The game is great because it is decently original and pretty basic. The developers didn’t try to make it all complicated and ruin the game. Also, for some reason I’m madly in love with the sound track and the adorable characters! 100% amazing!"
"11216",1065906948,"I think that this app is super fun and addicting. You don’t have to buy the characters with real money but you unlock them with points you earn in the game. I think that there should be levels and more characters to unlock maybe bonus unlocked levels for special events or holidays. Overall amazing!"
"11217",1065906948,"This game is super addicting and I love it so much! I always convince myself to play it to get coins and buy more characters!"
"11218",1065980436,"At first, lots of fun, lots of wins. I support games I like and while stuck in house during hurricane I purchased. BIG mistake as I have lost ever since. So sad as I enjoy the games."
"11219",1065980436,"The win zone is STILL broken.dont waste your time or chips or your money on the “WIN ZONE “."
"11220",1065980436,"Exciting games that peak your interest and enjoyment. Love it❣️"
"11221",1066018502,"It is a bit rich for my blood, hence the three stars. The free content is great though, and it’s really cool that you can mix in music or ambients."
"11222",1066018502,"I liked this app at first until I looked up one of the teachers on here and learned all about sexual abuser Noah Levine. He has had his teaching authorization rescinded by his organization, but is still on here?! Disappointing and disgusting."
"11223",1066018502,"I love this app and starting using it when it had less to offer! Love how much it has to offer, just wish more was free!"
"11224",1066091585,"El mejor juego de youtubers"
"11225",1066091585,"Este juego es lomejor y tu también Fernán eres el mejor salúdame en uno de tus videos"
"11226",1066091585,"👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👩👩"
"11227",1066111223,"This was a great game. A little challenge but can be solved without hints. Enough puzzles to keep you thinking. Enjoyed the water fountains and final puzzle was solved by my wife as I again over thought it lol!"
"11228",1066111223,"This one was easiest for me, the puzzles were great and I figured them out without a walkthrough. I love Goro Sato’s games! If you are looking for a cool, challenging and fun escape game, this is it! Definitely give it a try. 5 stars!!!"
"11229",1066111223,"This one was a bit hard because I couldn't find a rain drop :) but it's just as fun as any of his other games! His escape games are my favorite!"
"11230",1066135421,"... how do you turn the f'n music off?"
"11231",1066135421,"I don't normally write reviews and especially, a negative one but, it's a waste of money, even if it's 99c and I already deleted the game... At the very first level, one minute into the game am unable to bypass some silly meaningless not engaging or thought provoking challenge (jump over some silly canyon) and... every single time I 'fail' I get a message asking me to 'start a game from start' or 'load saved game' and each single time I have to select the option. The game might be beautiful (from the developer pictures and the video) but, whoever came up the idea of having those options popping up each time you can't bypass a so called challenge? Shame as the game looked beautiful. I guess there is a reason one there is not one review for this game, lesson learned."
"11232",1066135421,"It is impossible to beat please fix other than that great game"
"11233",1066322956,"At first, I thought that the few numbers of features of the app make it simple to use, and I can move some of my essential daily todos to this app ( from Things ). But in the first week, I got disappointed. It lacks some of the necessary features, the stacked UX is not good, and it doesn’t make sense to me as I expected."
"11234",1066322956,"Please update app, I keep getting things I written erase has I’m typing them or when I’m done and I have to write it again. Sometimes happens 3 times in a row on the same sentence!"
"11235",1066322956,"I bought this because I liked the idea of subtasks, but it’s honestly a useless app because adding tasks leaves your home screen blank unless it is currently due. So if you add three tasks to complete by tomorrow night, you won’t see them unless you navigate to the “see all tasks pane” - which defeats the purpose to me. Literally any other free task app is more useful than this. I’m going to ask for a refund because my money would be better spent on one of those claw vending machines. Even if I get nothing, the experience would still be worth more than this app."
"11236",1066338494,"Muy bueno algo diferente a lo acostumbrado 👍"
"11237",1066338494,"I thought the live wallpaper would be moving like a screen saver on the PC or something !! But otherwise you have to push and hold for it to move manually, and i also didn't like how short the period for it moving."
"11238",1066338494,"Live paper only shows motion on lock screen. No motion once logged in. The motion has to be manually activated and only runs one cycle per activation."
"11239",1066752474,"Way to many advertisements. I might have to use a different app"
"11240",1066752474,"I love the games!  Keeps me sharp (@ 82 years old)!"
"11241",1066752474,"Love this game.I play hours at a time(81years old)keeps my mind going."

"11245",1066882875,"This is a very fun game! I love the different backgrounds especially the Ecaflip dimension. You guys are an awesome company and your animations are awesome. Plus, the tofus look like Az🐤!"
"11246",1066882875,"I really liked it at first but the problem is each time you get out you have to start all over from the beginning which gets boring and repetitive. It would be nice if you could start at the level you had just passed before getting out. Because of this, I'm over it and am now searching for a new game and probably going to uninstall this."
"11247",1066882875,"Good time killer"
"11248",1067084549,"An update for IPhone XS Max screens. I’ll take it! I still love and play this game! I wish you could do more with it. I’d love more flails and arenas. I love this game."
"11249",1067084549,"Great time waster though."
"11250",1067084549,"This game is trash"
"11251",1067117430,"My little bro loves it!  😀😀😀😀😀😀😄😄😉😉😉😉😉😀😉🙂😃😍😍🥰🙂😀😃👍👍👍👍👍🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱"
"11252",1067117430,"Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad"
"11253",1067117430,"Neat idea, but sometimes executes moves when no play button is in sight. Other times it stops recognizing instructions in the middle of a level and needs to be restarted."
"11254",1067146012,"Great update to a classic story with games and animations my kids love."
"11255",1067146012,"Disappointing.   The main app is ok, but the word search is too advanced for my 2 year old."
"11256",1067146012,"All my daycare kids love the Dr. Seuss books and they especially enjoy the electronic versions which put them in control of the pages and story."
"11257",1067205290,"良好的体验，强烈推荐。"
"11258",1067205290,"免费小说看的不错，希望放些在线免费小说阅读"
"11259",1067205290,"好多中文书都会闪退，这个我看了很长时间都没有，下载速度也很快，很不错的"
"11260",1067212421,"The graphics and the game's title made me think that this would be a fun stress free game. Wrong!  While the graphics are beautiful, I found myself tensing up and stabbing at my iPad.  Sorry"
"11261",1067212421,"I simply love this game. It's easy yet challenging. Very engaging game!"
"11262",1067212421,"This might be the most relaxing platformer I've ever played. With user-created levels to add replayability, this game is worth the great price."
"11263",1067456521,"I keep this app on my phone to motivate me on a regular basis. Good job!"
"11264",1067456521,"This is completely perfect for when we are at restaurants and we are waiting. I bought the whole bundle you should too!"
"11265",1067456521,"I purchased this book as a part of a bundle along with The Lorax, Green Eggs and Ham, The Foot Book, 1 Fish 2 Fish and Dr. Seuss's ABC's. The bundle I purchased is outdated and the books were slowing down my iPad (according to the notification I received when opening the app). My son was unable to collect stars and play the games as this was a newer feature and my app won't update so I repurchased one of the books out of the bundle. Disappointing that you can't maintain ALL of your bundle purchases. I'll be thinking twice before buying any more apps from this developer."
"11266",1067458275,"will launch a version for voice recognition in Spanish"
"11267",1067458275,"Perfect for me and my short term memory loss.  Support was fast and friendly  Eady to use. Highly recommended"
"11268",1067458275,"Wow 😃 this app is absolutely amazing just as i wanted!!!! It does works great very easy to use and it is very smooth.... nice work 👍🏻"
"11269",1067468386,"Every 3 games there’s an ad. The games are very repetitive (balance 5 people, balance 7 people...boring) I guess they make the free game annoying so people will pay for the full game."
"11270",1067468386,"😬💨     👈😂"
"11271",1067468386,"Too many adds but otherwise great"
"11272",1067589627,"You can’t turn or anything what a riff off I am telling you never ever I mean ever play this game listen to me thanks for your time and listen to reviews this is so true do not play this game."
"11273",1067589627,"Just dont get it even the name tells you that it’s simple"
"11274",1067589627,"This game is really good but I really want a 3rd person option because it’s really hard to play in 1st person.."
"11275",1067596534,"please updated to ios 12。good app。"
"11276",1067596534,"I sure hope they do nothing more to this app than update it for changes in the iOS!  Perfect little app with the simplicity of fewer choices that allow you to go in, do what you planned to do and move on."
"11277",1067596534,"Review update:  Please update the app for the latest screen sizes.  Pleeeaaase.  Original:  The app is top rate and notch!  Really enjoying it.  For me it is missing one thing which is the ability to put a circle or box around things you are wanting to annotate.  Thanks so much for creating this app.  It is appreciated."
"11278",1067644352,"I play on a IPad 4 gen and app will no longer open"
"11279",1067644352,"I’ve enjoyed playing this game. Some challenging and some easy. Love the little burst of energy in the levels."
"11280",1067644352,"Good game of distraction, well for me. Get my mind out of the reality"
"11281",1067684327,"Good app easy to follow"
"11282",1067684327,"Lovely ascetic. Simple to grasp and very enjoyable!"
"11283",1067684327,"I really enjoy playing this game"
"11284",1067720154,"Doesn't quite give you the exhilarating feeling I was hoping for. Not a very good sense of control.  More like an interactive installation than a game except it's frustrating haha. The creators should learn from Chameleon Run. That is an awesome and beautiful game."

"11289",1067848964,"Global ranks no longer load. This game used to be awesome. Now it is not playable. Awful. Developers: update your app.!!"
"11290",1067860796,"Like a lot of other people, this app tricked me into paying full price for a year- and apple refused to refund me. I felt like it must have been my fault- maybe I didn’t read the fine print- but now I’ve seen all the other reviews saying that they too were tricked out of their $ so unfortunately it looks like I’m not the only one. The app was so full of glitches that I couldn’t use it."
"11291",1067860796,"I'm no longer able to attend scheduled yoga classes and Asana Rebel has become my workout partner. Really enjoying the variety of teachers and their technique! I would suggest showing different workouts depending on the time of day. Thankfully yours"
"11292",1067860796,"I’ve been a member for more than a year and this is the best app out there. I canceled my gym membership and meditation apps because Asana Rebel is all you need for total mind, body, spirit wellness. It just needs more barre and Pilates to be a perfect app to meet total wellness needs."

"11294",1067891186,"I really enjoyed this app when it first came out. My friends on iOS really had fun utilizing the cool features. It was even more fun once it was available to Android. Time has passed and no one I know logs on anymore - but I do. It’s probably the only safe haven for me. I could make private account on other social media to journal and vent on but I’ve been using this for so long it’s all I know. I would be happy if it was around for a long time. If there was a way to export my posts and comments if it is ever removed from the Apple store I’d be grateful. Thanks for giving me a place to enjoy sharing with my friends and a place where I can simply be me."
"11295",1067891186,"This app is pointless."
"11296",1067903136,"Can't figure out how to play it."
"11297",1067903136,"I am going to give it a four-star because I don’t like how the squares and get so little so easily it makes it really really hard to get a high score of 75 gets basically impossible after like after 70"
"11298",1067903136,"Need to update the game to support the X and it’s screen format. Couldn’t stand playing when not full screen."
"11299",1067937065,"U can only do one animation"
"11300",1067937065,"Can you make it so you can hook it up on the same type of 3D Character game?"
"11301",1067937065,"It will be great for animator to have the ability to pose and animate the character with all the different outfits and lights setup. Waiting on that so much ."

"11305",1068076031,"I have been playing this game for almost 2 years now. And finally made it to level 100, it says it’s downloading and stays at 0%. Would like to know what I’m doing wrong."
"11306",1068076031,"Never win bonus always stuck in first game"
"11307",1068076031,"It’s a great game, except for the dragon levels. It’s not quite fair to be pitted against the dragon , first level 300 vs 700; second level 300 vs 1000; 3rd level 300 vs 1700. The player should have more on each level to make it fairer competeion. That’s my only negative response. Otherwise , I love the game."
"11308",1068100966,"Pretty good app. A little hard but that’s good because I won’t be done in two seconds. I have not found any glitches so it’s really cool."
"11309",1068100966,"Nice graphics. Some puzzles were fun but a couple make little sense even after seeing the walkthrough. The happy/sad one, for example, I don't see how anyone figures out without guessing.  It's just one room and then it's over -- but I was kind of glad there were no more after shaking my head at so much of it!"
"11310",1068100966,"This one of the best room escape games on the App Store!!!"
"11311",1068110571,"I’m really enjoying this App...I love using the various milestones and pictures to enhance my baby’s photos and help tell a story"
"11312",1068110571,"Eh it’s pretty good, but if you want the better stuff you have to pay"
"11313",1068110571,"Amazing I love it !!"
"11314",1068204657,"I really do enjoy this game! It’s fun and the right amount of interactive. My only issue is the need to spend your own money for certain story lines. Like, why should I have to spend close to 1000 diamonds on a violin and an owl to progress the story, when I wouldn’t even want them in the first place. I downloaded then game again after leaving it for a while, and I think this was the exact reason why."
"11315",1068204657,"I love the game but the prices for equipment and to style your cafe are getting ridiculous. I can't even finish the challenge because I don't have enough money to upgrade a machine.   I already do the phone orders. By the time I earn the money the challenge is over. Like now I can't purchase the new machine to complete the challenge because I don't have enough money because I used the money to upgrade the last new machine 🙄😡. So now I won't be able to complete the orders for this new challenge because it requires the new machine to complete. I play this game literally everyday!!!"
"11316",1068204657,"Soo... i got one problem in this game and i also saw online on some forums where people are reporting a similar problem. The game is good, however, the experience your server or barista gains after serving a customer is really out of sync. I tested it out. Your barista serves a customer and customer pays you gold. In return, we get 1 exp. so i closed the app overnight and saw in the morning that i had earned more than 200 gold and all you get is still, 1 exp. this is annoying. Really annoying and it takes forever to level up.  More exp should be provided."
"11317",1068236871,"Downloaded. Opened. It was like I went back to the iPhone 1. All you do is click through some prompts. I use the browser. It is terrible as well but I use it because it is the best out there. Covenant I love you guys but you are far far behind. Even the new screen accountability isn’t hitting the mark. We need an updated browser one that works well. We want to use you and you help us but please work to keep up with the times."
"11318",1068236871,"Glad they made this app, but next version needs to improve on some big bugs.   1) navigating away from app (like changing screen brightness or typing notes in another app) causes it to start over on the entire day.  2) videos don’t have sound, so I have to copy the link and play elsewhere  3) passcode lock page has “forgot password” link that blocks the 0 button  4) need iPad compatibility because it’s easier to read on a larger screen  5) allow split screen in iPad so I can take notes in a separate app on the same screen.   Good things  A) great content from a variety of sources  B) good daily self-ranking system  C) passcode lock is nice"
"11319",1068236871,"Videos don’t play.   Becomes a lot of frustration"
"11320",1068366903,"I love the Emily Wants To Play Series, and so far I’ve bought all of them!  There is a problem with the controls pad, involving quick glitches of movement when carefully dragged. I also think that Emily Wants To Play Too is a bit smoother.  The bright side is that the game is amazing and very scary. The environment is horrifying, and the game is replayable and fun every time!"
"11321",1068366903,"I’ve never paid for mobile game but I had to get this one, there’s not another game out there like it, so I played the all the dolls games but when it comes to miss Emily the controls start Buffon out. Can’t open doors the directional keys on the left of the screen moves up from where it traditionally is and somehow when I try and open doors to find the little brat I get turned around somehow and every second of those 75 are precious. Please fix this or is the operator? (I doubt it) I might have to get the Xbox version to truly experience little miss Emily and dolls.                Yours truly-gonna find that brat"
"11322",1068366903,"For some reason, it will not play the game. It will freeze and after about 10 seconds, crash. If you could help in some way, it will get 5 stars. Fix it or I want a refund."
"11323",1068366937,"You should play because it’s fun"
"11324",1068366937,"Game crashes whenever I try to load it, so I literally can’t even get into my reef anymore. FaceBook connection has been broken for months now. Takes months to hear back from customer support too. Don’t waste your time installing if you’ve never played, its not worth even trying this game now."
"11325",1068366937,"It may be due to a lack of gameplay when your device is under 1.59 of ram.  Total ram spec 0.97 gb.   This notification appears, I click okay, I accept terms and services, the game crashes.   I’d love to play again, I used to play all the time but now I can’t even open the app.  Please fix this"
"11326",1068378177,"Hello Folks,  Just a small review for the best animated series Yu-Gi-Oh we all are playing around a year and more. Just for the best into gameplay how about a big update for animated characters and monsters (see how they attack opponents monsters and vice versa), or how a character uses his trap card and and.  Hope hearing that shortly.  Regards."

"11328",1068378177,"Good gameplay. Graphics are fine. The pvp duels are rigged to make sure you lose sometimes though. You can have the most well balanced deck and get dealt all spell or trap cards. One time is bad luck but four matches in a row? You get put into positions where you have no moves so you either surrender or just sit and take the beating. Which means grinding out and eating losses to move up anywhere. Make it actually random and not geared to get people to spend more money and buy cards and you’ll have a bigger fan base."
"11329",1068416637,"Great puzzle that is fun to play...with beautiful graphics and relaxing background music......challenging puzzle without being difficult just to be difficult...you have to just use your brain... I thoroughly enjoyed Zenge, good job!!!"
"11330",1068416637,"It was a pleasure to play."
"11331",1068416637,"I love all the games you’ve produced.  I want more levels of Zenge and klocki and push and scalak desperately (and I’m still working through the others). Every level is clever and keeps you thinking and I’ve never felt like giving up."
"11332",1068512694,"I really want my money back. This game is so bad."
"11333",1068512694,"I used to love this game and I played it everyday however recently I can’t play one game without it crashing! Please fix it and I will give a five-star review!"
"11334",1068512694,"The AI in the last round in superstar cup is WAY high I can’t get the cup of four arms please lower the AI on the final because it’s WAY high so high for me to even get three goals"
"11335",1068556466,"OMG I got jipped of $0.99!!!! Horrible horrible horrible app. I’m kicking myself in the head for not trusting the recent negative reviews. NO CONTENT!!!! Do NOT download!"
"11336",1068556466,"Been looking for a great atlas app with world maps and a search feature since the disappearance of the National Geographic Atlas. Tried quite a few, and this is by far the best! Great job! I found it really interesting that the App Store is flooded with geography quiz apps. They’re almost a dime a dozen now."
"11337",1068556466,"Purchased this app for my backpacking trip in Europe, and based on the reviews I had high expectations. Sadly, the app never seems to work right and is constantly loading and will eventually error out saying it can't connect to the server, both on WiFi and cellular data. Don't waste your $0.99, instead just download Wikivoyage offline pages."
"11338",1068596150,"Good slots"
"11339",1068596150,"Love the graphics but haven't been able to enjoy a full game. It keeps closing and I have to reopen the game"
"11340",1068596150,"Why are you taking my credits?  When I closed the app I had over 66,000,000.  When I opened it later, I had only 60,000,000. No, I am not mistaken because I keep track of my credits.  STOP STEALING MY CREDITS!!!!"
"11341",1068766238,"Nice."
"11342",1068766238,"When I scanned a code it either said that the code was unreadable which there was no possible way.. or it said “404 not found” 👎👎👎 HUGE LETDOWN"
"11343",1068766238,"Downloaded and generated all within the same minute! WOW!"
"11344",1068808996,"Just update the game"
"11345",1068808996,"This game is a definite install for those who love cars, it’s really fun, simple, and offers a wide variety of cars and even more customization options. Cars are implemented into the game, but on a weird schedule. Which is perfectly fine, considering they add 4-5 cars at a time with beautiful and precise detail. All in all, definitely worth a try.  (Although I do wish they’d add a 2003 Ford Sporttrac)"
"11346",1068808996,"Love the game but I think it could use dirt tracks off-road tires sand tires lift kits for trucks and monster trucks"
"11347",1069160488,"very entertaining"
"11348",1069160488,"Fun"
"11349",1069160488,"For the past two days I have not been able to watch a video to double the amount of coins from the time I was gone. I can watch videos within the app but it’s not allowing you to watch any videos when it comes down to double the amount. I have restarted my phone my notepad and both are not working properly"
"11350",1069162618,"The concept is pretty cool and fun, but it really isn't enough in itself to be worth it in my opinion. Would be so much nicer if there was a mode where you could use your coins/score to upgrade your weapons/skills/characters/etc. and some kind of unlocks would make it so much better..."
"11351",1069162618,"Fun twist on Match 3. The playfield is a dungeon map and you can move your character around collecting keys and fighting monsters. But this feels like a prototype. No character progression, only one character, no weapons and very few skills. Doesn't even have rewards for making matches! Each game is a high score run, and once mastered, is pretty easy to accomplish unless you get a string of bad luck. Art is nice and core concept is awesome but needs so much more to make a worthwhile purchase. Swap Sword 2 please!!!"
"11352",1069162618,"I found the game kind of dull and repetitive--a combination that doesn't work. Look elsewhere for match-3 hybrids."
"11353",1069236120,"not able to get any more fusion matter"
"11354",1069236120,"This game is my favorite because it’s such a great game to pass the time, or when you need to do something with your hands😁👍plus the graphics are absolutely adorable!"
"11355",1069236120,"i’ve been playing this game for hours. it is so fun and i’ve never been bored while playing it."
"11356",1069287597,"哈哈哈哈！非常有意思的一个小软件"
"11357",1069287597,"真的"
"11358",1069287597,"说话能再快点就好了"
"11359",1069359097,"From something so simple. One complaint though. Why does the big light gray disk appear when you touch close to one end of a string 1) preventing playing closer to the end of the string and 2) It’s wasting time, and is frustrating, to have to keep putting the string end back to where it was. I’ve already gotten my monies worth with the sounds I’ve milked out of the app. Good idea nicely done! Needs to support landscape mode. In the YouTube video, where are those other screens with verbiage and dynamic graphics? Needs to save your drawings. Should also play in the background."
"11360",1069359097,"Audio Copy capability is a great addition to this already wonderful app. Looks beautiful. Sounds beautiful. Kudos to the devs!"
"11361",1069359097,"favorite music art app in a long time. makes me feel as though i'm in a cave painting the walls.  great!"
"11362",1069361548,"While the wallpapers are pretty interesting, it doesn’t justify spending $8 a month on them. A monthly subscription for wallpaper is just absurd, especially at the cost of a basic Hulu subscription. The free ones are also pretty entertaining but way too many ads with the tiniest exit bar just doesn’t make it worth it."
"11363",1069361548,"I never write reviews but seriously this is to save people from wasting their time downloading this app. I get it, every app developer wants you to buy the premium version but this was ridiculous. Pretty much every good live wallpaper was premium only. All the free ones were blah. And the worst thing that caused me to delete was the fact that every minute was an ad that would pop up. Complete waste."
"11364",1069361548,"Don’t download this app, it’s the worst thing ever and it’s so glitchy. I was using it and it gave me a virus and stole 200,000 dollars from me DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!"
"11365",1069508452,"Unlike some of the newer Big Fish games, this one has puzzles with clear instructions. There’s also no duplication of puzzles in the game, which is great. I also appreciate being able to zoom in on the HOPs. Even though I’m near-sighted some of these HOPs are tiny! The Hidden Object puzzles, are, however, a little wonky. More than once, I tapped the right spot repeatedly, but it wouldn’t clear the object until I hit the hint button. I also wish the game had been longer. Maybe if less time and megabytes are devoted to a few too many video cutscenes, there would be more room for additional gameplay!  This is an older game, but I intentionally sought an older game since the newer Big Fish games have been disappointing in regard to the puzzles and way too elaborate video cut scenes. Please make more games like this one!"
"11366",1069508452,"The story line is typical but the presentation and execution of the puzzles and hidden objects are fresh and imaginative. Really enjoy this game"
"11367",1069508452,"Graphics are nice and flow easily.  Games are not frustrating and make sense.  Narration does not completely take over the game, just enough to explain what's going on.  Have only made it through the first 5 scenes, but expect the rest to be just as good."
"11368",1069621692,"I have a 6s, didn't work for me."
"11369",1069621692,"It added blobs of brown and yellow color to my photo which then dissolved into my original photo. I seriously could've made this myself using power point. It looks like it uses MS paint for the colors and power point for the effect. Looks nothing like live photo. Don't waste your money, it's a ripoff."
"11370",1069621692,"Works smoothly. It's stupid simple don't so don't expect a lot of customization (pick one picture or two, then add an effect and you're done).  The deal breaker to me it that it substantially reduces the quality of the image - this flaw makes it not worth the $2."
"11371",1069710958,"I like this it's pretty good"

"11374",1069729519,"As soon as I downloaded the app there was plenty and tons of wallpapers to choose from you just have to hold down the wallpaper till the line ends on the top of the screen and then you can see what or how it moves. Great app to use😁"
"11375",1069729519,"Because i try it but it doesn’t work fw"
"11376",1069729519,"I’ve been trying to find a wallpaper app that was decent and reasonably priced. This is by far the best one out there! The pictures are crazy beautiful and lots of options and all for under &2!!  Thank you!"
"11377",1069735362,"The tapping is inaccurate I’d rather play it in real life I don’t recommend this game if u rage easy but it does kill time"
"11378",1069735362,"I downloaded it. And shiver me timbers! With a knife? HIYUA! And I can't play this hell shut game. You stab your face with everything. And.......... this is like tennis bloody. Please fix this plz...... impossible and horrible hard game. Fix right now."
"11379",1069735362,"It's good game in general, but it's just a game I would play just to kill time. If I'm waiting for something and it seems like it's taking forever, I will play this game. But I think it's a good game over all"
"11380",1069786966,"I mean the game is really good but I gotta admit there are way to many ads.It is not nessessary to have an ad every 10 seconds or so."
"11381",1069786966,"This is a hilarious game and I will recommend it to every sports player only a additions I’d like. Sonic the hedgehog 🦔!the hardest player to get you have to make missions to unlock players that will be sooooooooo crackerjack.   With a good purpose,sonic the hedgehog 🦔"
"11382",1069786966,"Bad bad bad cant shot stick to blocky football id rather play mincraft"
"11383",1069786972,"These game that talk come up with are makeing  me do better thing"
"11384",1069786972,"The game is way to repetitive and when your playing you win tickets from hitting 3 pointers and when you get three tickets you have a chance on getting a new skin but so many times when it showed me the skins and then mixed it up I noticed that I have both of those skins and then you think oh it will be it will let me try again but no if you win one it says you already have this character and says that your unlucky I think this game needs some work it’s absolute trash so don’t play it"
"11385",1069786972,"You already know the people who out good ratings were the makers. It’s not even a real basketball game! All you do is move the ball down the court with the defenders doing nothing to protect it, and then you shoot a 3 pointer! THATS THE WHOLE GAME!"
"11386",1069787152,"This app is amazing!!! I’ve played it for 5 min and it is already my favorite game by far! Highly recommend this game"
"11387",1069787152,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:7a3e164c4a3d2bc4 (or search the account name as ""ASO 100""). Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"11388",1069787152,"This game is... well, addicting. The concept is kinda cool, but could be better executed. I mean, I’m not trying to be rude, but it could be way better. There’s always just that one dumb ad that just won’t. Go. Away. After like 3 minutes, an X appears, but nothing happens when you press it. Most people put a ton of bad ratings on hockey games, but this is better than that. It’s still not perfect, though. Still, haters, go away. No one is perfect."
"11389",1069803052,"I’d called them: ““the coolest songs ever fully proposed””  aaaaaahaha  😫😠"
"11390",1069803052,"If you’re a parent all you hear is how evil you must be to give the children less screen time. Kids games don’t have to be educational, it has to be appropriate and have no ads. Toca boca is your best one. Even adults and teens love it. One person said toca boca was inappropriate. It’s not. They’re just jokes to please the crowd. Other kids games, like dr. Panda and sago mini have no ads and are not inappropriate. One thing you should not download is YouTube kids. My concern is that fnaf is on there. If you don’t know what it is let me tell you. Five nights at Freddy’s is a horror game with blood, murder and violence. Get toca boca games for your kids."
"11391",1069803052,"I love this game! It’s so fun. One suggestion though- could we have a bit more control over the dance moves please? Thanks!"
"11392",1069840000,"Please fix on iPhone X. This could be a good app but the screenshot is to small for the iPhone X."
"11393",1069840000,"Not working on iPhone X !"
"11394",1069840000,"Awesome trick but screenshot looks terrible on the Magic app, because the formatting is not right, so $7 just vanished....magically"
"11395",1070036646,"Very cool yet simple. I don't see any ads, maybe because I spent $2 on gems once.   Anybody know what the other miner icons do?"
"11396",1070036646,"Why can't we replay levels so that we could grind for extra diamonds?"
"11397",1070036646,"Almost every level is an ad, and not just any ad, they are ones that require interaction prior to moving on.  Come on guys, have some dignity, I felt like I was on a RyanAir flight."
"11398",1070107731,"This game is a pay to win and on top of that it’s also the glitchiest game ever created! Plz don’t download."
"11399",1070107731,"I love this game but I would like to see a larger roster of characters!"
"11400",1070107731,"This mobile game along with so many others want to much money. On this game, It’s fine at the beginning but for whatever reason when you get to like a couple missions cleared you’ll hit a big monster that has a lot of HP and extremely high attack. Basically a level spike. And it’ll give incentive to give real life money for gems and whatever else the devs wanted to create for you to give them your money. In my opinion these free-to-play games should all be completely free with no micro transactions whatsoever. Or change the virtue signaling name to something like “free-to-pay”. Not “free-to-play”. Because all you doing is giving free money to level up your character faster. Basically you are paying the devs to to say “you win” and make you feel good. Heck, everyone please give me money and I can program you a screen to flash “congratulation you win” every time you give me money."
"11401",1070226733,"I use this keyboard all the time. It helps me express my dark heart."
"11402",1070226733,"I read everything in advance and knew that these are more pictures than anything. But the pictures aren't really applicable for much and they are very big. I'm sad about it."
"11403",1070226733,"Love these stickers. Great art"
"11404",1070228823,"This is supposed to work as a sticker app on messages, but it’s pulling up a blank screen. Reinstalled, restarted, etc. iOS 12 on iPhone XS."
"11405",1070228823,"I have the Goth app and thought I'd get more by getting this one. Little disappointed, because it's got lots of the same stickers. If you'd add some to Goth and this, I'd give five stars. The apps themselves work fine. I'd even suggest some. <3"
"11406",1070228823,NA
"11407",1070255846,"The game needs to offer a way to get free shuffles"
"11408",1070255846,"Fun"
"11409",1070255846,"I recently changed my phone and lost my level of play. Was at level 559. Any suggestions!"
"11410",1070492711,"I find it problematic to reach goals on the temporary islands.  That part takes away some of the fun."
"11411",1070492711,"I thoroughly enjoy the simple premise that this game presents. Clearing out debris to find quest items is satisfying and not too troublesome."
"11412",1070492711,"Not much in game guidance.  Controls are a little clunky.  Fun for short time"
"11413",1070504791,"Thought this would just be a cute little game, but wow wayyyy more than I expected! I love this!!!!"
"11414",1070504791,NA
"11415",1070504791,NA
"11416",1070525362,"I can play tournament mode, but I cannot receive the rewards! Please fix"
"11417",1070525362,"Nice way to pass some time. Graphics are cool. It’s a bit frustrating at first to keep your ships on the track with no guard rails but you get used to it. Like anything else practice!"
"11418",1070525362,"The game is great, but the only thing I want is more content. I mean there are 2 additional rows for ships! Also some more levels please."
"11419",1070709625,"This is a great game and all but my game won’t stop crashing and kicking me out in the middle of the game. I just got the game too which is really disappointing"
"11420",1070709625,"I was downloading coin master to get my 700 souls but it didn’t work and I’m a the third village please fix it."
"11421",1070709625,"Still the gameplay is super fun"
"11422",1070716801,"I love the bar oasis series so much. I love the art. I love the story. I love the characters. I love the gameplay. I love the music. I love the concept. I love that it teaches me something useful, such as the art of mixed drinks and time management. I hope to play more games like this in the future."
"11423",1070716801,"Very happy to see a new addition to this fun and compelling series that taught me all of know about making cocktails without the massive expense of collecting all that alcohol. Story still interesting but it's a bit short on plot development compared to Bar Oasis 2. Also hope we can freely switch routes without losing bar development progress. I really want to experience all this game has to offer without being penalised."
"11424",1070716801,"It's a really good game. I've been following it since the first bar oasis game. The only reason why I give 4/5 stars is because well first it used to only be a dollar, but now its four dollars :T that made me a bit sad and another thing is there's ads even though I bought the game. That made me mad. But other than that it's a good game :)"
"11425",1070850573,"Very realistic analog sounding. You can learn all about wave forms and how modules effect one another, without having to buy an actual synth."
"11426",1070850573,"I’ve bought quite a few iOS synths...in a short time ;) this one might require a bit more study and effort but you can do sooooo much with it. FM and analogue! A mix of the two! I’m still learning but I’ve already created some great stuff by tweaking the presets and building from scratch isn’t that hard.  Thanks Kira. Please keep adding to this!"
"11427",1070850573,"It is pretty good right now, but they seem to do updates all the time. That tells me they care and that makes me care.lol Too many times have I spent my hard earned money on apps only to have them left incomplete and lacking. I’m a huge fan of eurorack/Modular and this is a great outlet for me on the road or at appointments! Thanks to the developers for keeping new and useful updates coming!!!!!"
"11428",1070999857,"Still ply this one at least an hour every day. By far one of the greatest games ever made!!!"
"11429",1070999857,"One review also mentions this but yes, the controls are very different and graphics and effort to make a game like this were also poor, but to mock the president?! Maybe he has made a lot of mistakes like Obama, and many other presidents, but srsly? Better take down this game before you get sued."
"11430",1070999857,"Best game ever"
"11431",1071006943,"Played it 5 times, got bored, deleted app."
"11432",1071006943,"Another winner from Ketchapp ,like all of their games this one is colorful ,fun ,addictive ,challenging ,and Will drive you crazy 😜"
"11433",1071006943,"I'm only keeping it at four stars cause of the lack of characters and goals to pass but otherwise the mechanics of this game are very fun and interesting and I would've given it 5 if it had a daily challenge system of something like that, but still this game is a must have. Nice job Ketchapp"

"11435",1071021891,"It's very good for Chinese students and it's maybe the best problems-solving App Store in the AppStore. (Also, I hope you guys can add a new feature to search problems' answers by inputting text.) Merci.  Roderick Qiu"
"11436",1071021891,"好，不错"

"11438",1071146166,"If you lean towards more conservative policies and and nationalism there is almost no way you can win on the harder levels. The hard levels become surprisingly easier when most of your policies picked are socialist/far left leaning 🤦🏼‍♂️. What a joke, app was probably funded by the DNC"

"11440",1071154495,"Great game...and very addictive. So much fun playing it."
"11441",1071154495,"the game is surprisingly addictive."

"11443",1071224055,"Response time is WAY OFF! The game is so sluggish that it makes it impossible to play! If the developers would fix this one HUGE problem, then the game would be fun! Until then, it's just a disappointing dud!"
"11444",1071224055,"It has a really slow reaction time, it's like you press the screen, but it waits to send the block, other than that, amazing game!!"
"11445",1071224055,"Horrible game!! Controls are very slow. Tutorial makes it very easy and responsive but the actual game mode, sometimes the tapping is slower than you actually tapping and sometimes it's faster. Worst game. I deleted it 3 minutes after I downloaded it."
"11446",1071310449,"It’s super fun"
"11447",1071310449,"This is a great game, but l agree with the other reviews. The diamond/ key system is ridiculous. We shouldn’t have to pay over $10 to read a recycled storyline that I can get from a real book. Id rather pay a one-time fee for the app than waste money on the diamonds/keys."
"11448",1071310449,"A Royal Romance:  PROS:  Can choose some of your dialogue.  Music coordinates with the story.  Can customize your appearance and change clothes.  It’s fun to be part of the story.  It’s a visual experience.   CONS: Every costume costs “diamonds” which can be purchased with real money.  If you want to go deeper into the story it’s costs. (There are optional scenes you can participate in. Some of them are superfluous but some really enhance the story.)  It costs more than buying a hardcover book but you get less text. (It can be read for free but you won’t get much of a story.) Can’t turn the page back to revise your choice or reread text.  Can’t change outfits when you want to.  After the chapter is done you can’t go back to it later so even if you “paid” for it, it’s not yours."
"11449",1071366753,"Esto me solo en las cartas de Europa solo me da gasolina no pueden hacer algo más que dar petróleo"
"11450",1071366753,"This game is based in 1975 not 2055 so why are their laser tanks another thing I do not understand at all why they made this game it’s horrible and I agree with all negative reviews and one more thing I see that u got bots to review u so really get the people’s opinion I really hope u fix your game"
"11451",1071366753,"It is good but needs tweaking"
"11452",1071426243,"Good game.  But.... repeatedly hangs. Have to restart it. IPhone Xs max 512GB. :("
"11453",1071426243,"My son enjoys Bushido Bear.  Imagine my severe disappointment and anger when I see there is an advertisement that runs within Bushido for Scatter Slots, an 18+ game showing scantily clad women and sexual innuendo referring lust, etc.    shocking!   Parents BEWARE!!!!"
"11454",1071426243,"I don’t know what happened to my original review but I’d like to say this game holds up years after I’ve downloaded it. I’m a little sad that it’s kind of a finished game but it’s simplicity allows for seemingly endless replay value and I’m glad I paid for it."
"11455",1071504918,"The games not bad when it works but the controls go unresponsive around every 5 minutes can't even get past 3rd level because of it."
"11456",1071504918,"Another example of ""Graphics before Gameplay"". While the game looks nice and definitely advanced in graphics (somewhat). Gameplay is VERY clunky. You must support a series of ""Power-Stations"" with an Agent, to support you must go to the station yourself and do whatever objectives asked. That's pretty much all you do. You will eventually get more Agents, however, THEY'RE COMPLETELY USELESS unless you start playing on them. So you find yourself with sticking to one agent only and upgrading him/her only. There are numerous bugs and glitches in the game. Invisible walls in the air, untouchable enemies, and much more. Some of these bugs (usually graphical ones) can completely ruin your game (Character frozen in jump sequence, controls literally died and can't move or turn, to name a few.). It did one thing right, it brought console gaming to mobile, indeed."
"11457",1071504918,"The concept behind the game is cool, though there is plenty of room for improvement. Fighting chains of enemies seem a little choppy because the character completely stops and stands rather than flowing smoothly to attack the next enemy. The gameplay has quite a few bugs that ruin the experience. These are a handful I've run into:  1. The dashing ability seems to remain usable until the second character is unlocked.  2. Jumping from a high place results in the character getting stuck floating forward with complete loss of control instead of landing on the platform. Only getting attacked by an enemy seems to return the character back to normal. Running off the platform is the only way to avoid this.  3. Failing challenges while in mid-air causes character to float and show the fail animation  4. Attempting to restart the game while falling doesn't work at times  5. Targeting certain enemies is occasionally impossible unless you target and attack a different enemy first  6. Initial infection rate of an area is always the same as the percent you finish the area with regardless of what it initially had  7. After the tumors start showing up on the power stations, there have been a few soldier enemies that randomly appear and can't be killed  8. Buying turrets doesn't appear to make them appear unless it's during a mission  9. Enemies can be pushed through tumors while attacked  10. Unable to scroll through skill description to see the cost of each upgrade  11. Attacking a jumping enemy can cause the camera to be stuck facing up  12. Attacking near a ledge can cause character to get stuck and unresponsive instead of falling off  13. Characters that are injured can still be selected before they are healed"
"11458",1071633581,"SPOILERS...  This entire chapter is based around an army-management minigame, building up to a battle at the end.  Now here’s the big spoiler.  WINNING OR LOSING MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.  If you win, you will get cheated of your victory by your plot-armored nemesis. If you lose, you will survive due to your own plot armor. Whatever happens, your friends will be all right and your kingdom will be overrun by demons.  In fact, losing may be BETTER. You get to screw up the minigame as badly as you like, and you’ll get a brainwashed friend back. In order to win, you have to kill them. If you lose, the only named NPC who dies is a gruff general who barely appears in The Lost Heir 3 anyway. The only real reason to win is bragging rights.  I assume the author responded to feedback that failing TLH1’s boss battle had far too harsh drawbacks by lowering the consequences for losing, but having an arguably NEGATIVE outcome for winning is bewildering.   END SPOILERS  I recommend just focusing on building up your character for TLH3, because that’s where the stat checks become truly brutal. Again, I recommend physical classes because, if you focused on Magic alone, getting a good ending will be much harder there."
"11459",1071633581,"One of the most AMAZING games I have played! I can’t Evan describe what it is like to lose yourself in this beautifully told story! I don’t wright reviews that much but WOW! This hits home! With so many classes o choose from! AH! Amazing just down right AZMAZING!"
"11460",1071633581,"This game mixed in the perfect sequel to the first in this saga and finished with a satisfying conclusion and was overall happy with the final outcome. This was a really well written and devolved story arch and makes you genuinely care for the characters!!"
"11461",1071767366,"Its sooooo cool and it’s really better than mincraft and more stuff than it and it needs something new.we really need a free mansion mod but if you agree with me then you must put the update on the game NOW.good luck-Irma"

"11464",1071879826,"I have use this app for quite a while, and I have found it really handy. But lately I am having trouble. I put in an address, and then I tap the street on the map so that I can move down the street and look around. That used to work, but it doesn't seem to work anymore. I don't know what to do to fix it. Please help.  I hope you can make it work right again – I will move you back up to five stars :-)"

"11470",1071976079,"It was a little hard to get used to, but once I did, it became one of the best games that I have ever played. Once you get new characters and more money, it becomes super fun!! Thanks for making this amazing app guys!!"
"11471",1071976079,"Bots are way too difficult to play against!"

"11475",1071976327,"I hate it when you download a game from an ad mini game and it is nothing like the mini game. This is another recycled game that is pay to win and is complete garbage. The App Store needs to give true average ratings and not adjust how many stars it gets. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS IS JUNK"
"11476",1072090698,"I love this game so much"
"11477",1072090698,"It's fun but you do die easily if you don't know how to get past each obstacle."
"11478",1072090698,"Uh-huh.  Just fix the sound the Indian makes and we'll call it even."
"11479",1072136623,"This is currently one of my favorite games!  I'm not too far into the game just yet, but so far it's quite fun. The characters are very charming and cute,  the Animation is very fluid, beautiful and complex,  And the story behind it is very interesting!  After I get done playing it I always have to take a few minutes to get my head right again, because all the flipping around and upside down so quickly kinda tricks my head into feeling like gravity actually works that way! X'D   but that really just goes to show what a great game it is, you can get so involved in it that messes with your head a bit!"
"11480",1072136623,"Simple, Fun, Elegant and most of all doesn't restrict the player with the use of in game ""battery's"" or in game ""purchase's"" there is one thing that is purchasable in the game and that's to get rid of Ads and that's it.  Well made platformer and a well made game over-all."
"11481",1072136623,"On the picture it says ""80 levels on 4 worlds"" but it only has 60 on all 4 worlds"
"11482",1072276976,"This game doesn’t explain how to turn the car. Even my 6 year old is super frustrated. How do you make the car consistently turn around the curves? Also there are way too many things happening in the race. This game is confusing!"
"11483",1072276976,"We are 2018 with iPads / iPods & iPhones with mostly 1GB ram I liked the idea till I got to “draw” a track you can’t even make a decent long track! Why give a long map I would not recommend nor pay for this I’m glad it went free.  Have a Nintendo Switch buy Nintendo Labo 5 pack with the car because there you can make a long & decent track ...  This is not fun. Dull & boring. Limited can’t paint can’t design. Doesn’t explain anything at all.  The five stars are obviously fake to promote this joke.  Do not pay for this! You get a lack luster racing game with a track creator that is nothing but drawing for five second to make a tiny track that you can barely design or do much with.  Get this free not paid!"
"11484",1072276976,"I bought this app and 4 others in a pack. Twice!  Once on my iPad and on my mothers for our grandson to play. They don’t tell you how to play, what to touch or anything. The characters just stare at you waiting. And you don’t know what they are waiting for. $20 wasted!  Want my money back. On iPads for a week and taking them all off."
"11485",1072364990,"I love this game,but please update for iphone x resolution,i know this imposible,maybe,but still i will hoping that day will come)"
"11486",1072364990,"I love the game, except when I crashes half way through, every time I play it. Fix it or give my money back, because it wasn’t worth this amount of frustration."
"11487",1072364990,"This game crashes every few minutes. Waste of money. Do not buy     I repeat until crashes get fixed game is not playable save your money"

"11491",1072395467,"The game is so addictive and me and my friends love to play this game"
"11492",1072395467,"I really love the game and I don’t know if the controls are good cause my phone has water damage but I’ve had some good runs but, I wish you could update this like you update the pc version. I really love game overall Tho"

"11494",1072408580,"Now I’m just sitting here, I’ve watched the credits and everything. I feel abandoned."
"11495",1072408580,"What a rollercoaster this series was! Do not pass it up. I see people saying they started with this game to see if they want to play the whole series. Don't. Start from the beginning. Part of the fun is watching the graphics and voice acting get tighter and tighter through the series. Did not want this series to end, can't wait for more Wadjet Eye ports."
"11496",1072408580,"Beautifully written and engaging. Interesting puzzles and a great, satisfying wrap up to the saga."
"11497",1072456036,"So this game it’s a four star for me because  well.. It’s like where are the other guys like the boy I forgot his name but his berry is a huckleberry and there’s more people and if you added more people maybe you could make new dreams like umm...being an artist or librarian so see how fast you can scan books and put them back and see how you can draw soo... that’s why it’s a four the end! AlSO can you make it so we have more then too people to work on like three? pLZ the dreams and people get boring after a while"

"11504",1072600030,"I have more criticism than praise for this game, but it's still a positive rating because it has a certain appealing charm to its aesthetics.   The best thing about the design is the branching and minor backtracking in the level design that makes it interesting to explore.  Levels are fun to explore for secrets but the player view is too limited to see hazards that should be visible. The level design doesn't take visibility into account. You often can't tell if dropping into a lower area is safe or if there are spikes. When you have to leap across a pit, you can't see the other side and judge distance. Pull the camera back a little so players can see more. Also maybe allow players to drag the view a limited distance from the avatar to see farther.  Constant pop ups to watch ads for game credits in mid game is annoying. Should limit ads to reasonable break points in gameplay. Also, should not allow watching ads to earn upgrades without playing the game because it cheapens the feel of earning upgrades through gameplay.   Combat is dull button mashing. Player lacks options in combat so every fight feels the same.  Getting stun locked is death and feels lame. There's nothing you can do to win if you're stunned. Player needs ability to break stun. Stun lock by spikes is especially annoying since you're stuck until you die so it's worse than instant death.   Some enemies can shoot from inside walls, which feels cheap since you can't fight back, and feels like careless design.   Gear upgrade system is boring, since every item for each equipment slot must be bought in order and each is just a slightly stronger version of the previous. It's not any different from just adding more points into a stat.   Art style and music are very nice. Animations and sound effects lack energy."
"11505",1072600030,"This feels like a mediocre kongregate game but then you get a 5 minute intro of the worst sci-fi tweets you’ve ever read leading to the “tutorial” which is just playing in ten second bursts while the game pauses to reveal a new directional arrow and saying you can press that to move in that direction.  Then after that lobotomy you might play for an hour or two then find out it didn’t save anything and you need to do the whole intro again.  Also don’t bother with the challenges, as soon as an enemy spawns the game harasses you with one of its constant pop ups begging you to watch a video while you get shanked in the background.  I gladly support games with ad clicks and purchases but not when they constantly interrupt the actual game with greedy panhandling."
"11506",1072737282,"Probably the BEST and MOST ADDICTIVE GAME I EVER PLAYED! (that was a shooter game) i really recommend this app because it was very fun and extremely challanging!!!🤩☺️🤯"
"11507",1072737282,"I thought this upadate was supposed to fix scaling for new devices, but it still does nor scale with the new iPad which is super annoying."
"11508",1072737282,"I never write reviews on this App Store. I usually just play, enjoy, then move on. However, for this game, I need to share my experience. First off I bought this game about a year ago and just never opened it because for me it was an impulsive buy. I felt so dumb in hindsight because this game is amazing. It has combat, stealth, witty writing, solid animation, solid frame rates, wonderful gameplay mechanics, and each mission feels unique and different. Missions don’t feel repetitive, they did a great job with diversity in the objectives and goals for each individual mission that pops up in the game. I never wanted to stop playing this game. In fact, as soon as I finished the main game I bought Ava’s additional missions. It was a phenomenal experience and honestly I’m jealous of you if you’re reading this and you haven’t bought it yet because you can live the experience of it from the beginning again with no expectations.  In summary, buy this game. - Yonkers, New York  Signing off"
"11509",1072844973,"Cool game"

"11512",1072881532,"Great concept and play design. But, it’s ultimately way too frustrating. I had to delete it after a couple dozen attempts. The unrelenting RNG makes it unplayable. On almost every turn there’s a 10% chance of bad luck. Eventually, all of that bad luck adds up."
"11513",1072881532,"This is a fun game don’t let the graphics fool you. And some strategy thrown in with some RNG as well."
"11514",1072881532,"Worth it!  Pick it up. Hope to see more from the team that did this game."

"11518",1073002250,"I started the app, signed up and got a blank “pledge” screen. Then, when trying to access the workouts, all I get is the “loading” spinner.  Also, when an app has not been updated in a year, it’s not being cared for."
"11519",1073002250,"I cannot log in. Re create a account, it says I have one. I’ve tried Facebook too. Nothing. Bummed out."
"11520",1073002250,"This app has the potential to be the best fitness and healthy living app I have ever used. I would buy this app either separately or in a bundle with the book and I think a lot of others would too!   Please expand the recipes section. Heck I would even be ok with in-app purchases to buy more recipes similar to how the books are set up!  The eBook is very cumbersome to find the recipes and keep flipping back and forth between pages for the substitutions- an option could be to customize a recipe in-app to ensure the portions are correct for the food you like and have access to.   The workout tracker is nice, but it would be great if there were videos or descriptions of each exercise within that section instead of the “samples” section.   The journal could be added to the app too! The eBook version is very difficult to add text/etc on a mobile device.   It would also be a nice function to link the app to instagram so we can post directly from it to join in and track the challenges and expand our fitgirl sisterhood.   Again, I love the current layout of the app and it could be do much more with a few additions!"
"11521",1073059261,"Fun relaxing game"
"11522",1073059261,"This app awful! Do not get it. I'll make a perfect square, but it won't let me move to the next level. Even if it did work, it's a very boring game, all you do is make squares. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!"

"11527",1073142282,"It’s not very often that a game makes me cry, but this one did. I felt so attached to the men under my command that my reactions to their hardships were very visceral. I am very much looking forward to the continuation of this amazing story."
"11528",1073142282,"Superb details, great choices, enough chances to level up character skills, great battle scenarios also. However I have bought Sabres of Infinity and Guns of infinity now I’m just waiting for Lords of infinity ."
"11529",1073142282,"Amazing story. Buy it now. Buy Sabres if you haven’t played it. Paul “Cataphract” Wang is honestly one of the best authors of young adult CYOA fiction out there. I’ve probably spent too much money on bad CYOA. This is not one of those purchases. In retrospect I’d be happy to pay more. If you haven’t checked out the lore on his website or become a patron of his on Patreon... well you should. Hope this helps any prospective buyers."

Cannot use boosts or tickets to buy more emerald points which make it impossible to earn any emerald points. Even after each game,watching video ads will not reward emerald points. I climbed the leader board and at the end of the game, I was even unable to remain on the royal level due to the fact that it wouldn’t allow me to earn ANY emerald points. I have refused to buy anything cuz I’m just throwing my money away. Everyone else I’m playing has already earned 500 while I still remain at zero points earned. Tired of the same old lame answers from Zynga. I used to play this game to relax but it’s causing more stress. Game won’t let me ask for help from friends nor am I able to see their help requests. All ratings I have read are basically how disappointing the game is by other players. Stop rigging the game and let us earn more boosts or I’m gone!"

"11544",1073473120,"This is what I’ve been looking for!  It’s very relaxing and not overbearing.  One thing I wonder about is not being able to use it on a Bluetooth device.  Am I doing something wrong or won’t it work foe Bluetooth?  Curious. Charlie T"
"11545",1073476012,"The game itself is great but your first few spins you get legendary and epic but the last ten times I’ve spun the wheel  I’ve gotten common and a car I already have and you should also be able to BUY Cars instead of spinning the wheel"

Sometimes the puzzles really made me think snd the cute graphics made it that much more enjoyable for me. I was disappointed when i just completed the last level . It was like when youre eating a snack , and finish it without realizing untill you reach in the bag and its empty. Hope to see more levels"

"11572",1073907652,"I love the tracing and rate capture. It has been a great help managing heart rate. It is incredibly variable as to whether it saves a reading. Very frustrating!"
"11573",1073907652,"It show the heart rate ok,  but it will only save it if the heart rate is regular and normal rate. I want to show my doctor when rate was irregular and jumped from fast to slow. It is worthless at this point."
"11574",1073907652,"What’s with all the beeping when the volume is off? Took 4 resting readings in a row and they increased from 68 to 85. Used a real monitor and got a consistent 70. If you have heart issues and/or need to check your heart in public, this is not the app for you."
"11575",1073946317,"Real neat game guys.. I like how you incorporated the trophy system from other games .. my only thing i can think of is to maybe have new fields or venues to play at when you hit new trophy highs. (I just started so that may already be the case)  Either way .. cool game guys, cheers"
"11576",1073946317,"5/5. This game is really fun and addicting. It always gets better with each update, so thank you for reading the reviews. 1) Please add a way to mute people so you don't have to see them say anything. 2) Add a button on the menu to play the offline computer players instead of always just before a match. 3) Somehow penalize people for cancelling a match when they're about to lose. It's annoying when I'm about to win and they quit the game prematurely, which causes ""connection problems"" and I don't get rewarded. 4) Please let us sell unwanted equipment cards too. Great game!!!"
"11577",1073946317,"From Thursday (Jan 26) until Saturday I was able to play normally but on Sunday the connection problems started again. It's impossible to finish any match, sometimes the match didn't even start and the ""connection lost"" message pops up...  It was a good simple game, like a chess tabletop football game, but  the connection problems make it unplayable. Also developers seem to be very greed with the constant increasing of the necessary amount of cards to make a player upgrade"
"11578",1073948898,"But It won’t let me download any more songs"
"11579",1073948898,"I went to download a song and it wouldn’t let me so I thought I didn’t have enough storage so I pretty much deleted all my apps for one song that wouldn’t download and it still isn’t downloading"
"11580",1073948898,"My phone says there was an update 4 days ago and i can no longer download music.   Please fix this!!!"
"11581",1073959479,"Can not remove ads and there are quite a lot."
"11582",1073959479,"Purchased the Katamari content from the in-game shop and got charged but didn’t receive the content, and there’s no convenient or visible way for me to contact someone about the purchase. I just lose."
"11583",1073959479,"Soooo many ads, and heaven forbid you start watching some, as it then assumes you want to watch ads even when you select the home button to go back to the main screen, and sometimes as an extra special bonus it plays two ads in a row, that’s a minute of watching ads just to be able to use your second life.  Games like this have turned into adware, they should make app blockers for garbage like this."
"11584",1073992168,"I played this game years ago on an old device and had a blast and it was feasible and more realistic as far as the competition and being competitive I passed all classes and championships and have 3 garages full of cars and couldn’t ask for a better game so present day I downloaded the same game on my current device and it’s extremely hard to compete and even though you fully upgraded cars and tune them you just can’t seem to win past the pro street and it’s just no fun when you play to ungraded and spend a lot of time tuning cars and can’t win any longer so I hunted down my old phone and charged it up to play it on my old device and all is great then I started entering back in the points races and even though my cars are still tuned by the creators of the game they want even stay on the track or want run to a full pass without bouncing off the track or blowing the engine not sure what they done but they have completely ruined this amazing game and app hopefully they get things fixed and make this the great game it use to be as I’ve still not seen any others to compare to it if not then oh well I’ll find something else that cares more about its bugs apps and ratings"
"11585",1073992168,"Iv played this game for a year and spent like 400 dollars on this game and I got a new phone and lost everything I need help there is no customer service"
"11586",1073992168,"How is it that all street cars are limited to 15 psi when leroy cleetus mcfarlands twin turbo v8 puts out 20 plus psi up to 30 psi the horsepower limitations are too much but the game is still good"
"11587",1074004076,"I bought this game and when I wanted to play it again some time later, it shows that I never bought the game. So if you only want to play this game ONCE it's a decent game. Oh btw BF is no help."
"11588",1074004076,"I like this game series and this installment is great but I have one issue. I can't find any Parable pieces that make up the small side stories! Where are they? Anyone else having this issue? Please help!"
"11589",1074004076,"I have enjoyed all of the Dark Parables games. I've played them all many times. I can't wait for the next game to come out!!"
"11590",1074006236,"I usually get bored or hate games once I see all the ads or endless amounts of purchases needed to even compete, but this is more game than the rest. Fun. Love the idea. And it’s worth going back to time and time again. I’m not deleting this game ever."
"11591",1074006236,"So fun, addictive, I love this game!"
"11592",1074006236,"This game is very fun! And I know people are thinking it’s repetitive, but it’s a dungeon crawler and it’s a arcade game. It’s meant for you to play for like 30 minutes. This game is funny, silly, and addictive. And this game is the best game I picked up when I got my first phone!"
"11593",1074061701,"It was great, good story and art and pretty easy. But then it crashed.  I have an older iPad and have successfully played several dozen Bigfish games. This one went dark at what I think was about 3/4 way through, argh! I deleted and reloaded, same thing happened. I'll see about a refund but just a warning."
"11594",1074061701,"The artwork is particularly good. The game is imaginative and creative. Story is interesting"
"11595",1074061701,"I like the Big Fish games. They are fun, challenging but not too hard."
"11596",1074068315,"I really like this game!! BUT it just keeps crashing and it wont save my progress. I have had to retrain at least 3 times now! Please fix!"
"11597",1074068315,"It is fantastic game, with a lot of detail, great graphics (especially for a mobile game) and a lot of creative freedom for the player.  I only have two issues.  1:  When you first start, the UI is confusing, even with the tutorial...   2: Every time I leave the game, and join back, All my sequels disappear.  I have to click the sequel button hundreds of times to get all them back to re-appear.  Of those were fixed, or even just the sequel bug, I would bring up the stars to 4."
"11598",1074068315,"This game is a lot of fun. I’ve played the other major game dev games like the ones from Kairosoft and Greenheart Games. There are some aspects of this that are great, like the size and multiple teams. It’s a completely enjoyable game to play. But...  There are a few things that the other games do better. Having access to all genres and game types from the get go is nice, but not being able to see what combinations are best makes innovation nearly impossible, and without any benefit. There’s nothing to be gained by experimenting with different combinations of type, genre, platform, age group, etc. because it doesn’t save what you’ve learned so far. The two other games above have a system to learn from the games you’ve made so that you can see what combinations work best and improve in the future. There’s seemingly no rhyme or reason to why games succeed or fail, and it’s impossible to figure it out. The only option is to look for guides and lists that have recommendations for good combinations and just repeat the same dozen that I know work. Innovation is integral in the game development industry, and this has none of that."
"11599",1074222293,"I like playing the game but it feels kind of pointless. Like I'm not playing toward anything or leveling up or advancing my weapon for more functionality. Yeah I can buy more potions but that stupid flomboy system isn't based on anything. I can play a game extremely well or very poorly and I'm going to get the same bonus round to get free flomboys no matter what. And the ""bosses"" are kinda pointless too. So you beat them and then what? Nothing.   There's a pretty cool foundation here but you need something to get the player interested in playing the game and trying to play well. From what I can tell I can pretty much start a level, wait for it to expire then play the bonus round for my 150-1000 flomboys over and over although with no advancement. Like I said, it all seems pointless."
"11600",1074222293,"Great game at a great price!"

"11602",1074223087,"I am on an iPhone 6s plus and my game force closes when I try to enter the arena. Game is very fun but this is frustrating"
"11603",1074223087,"This game is more unique then most tap and play games, it focuses more on getting characters too counter your enemy but, this game is very loosely translated from another language and could definitely use help on correcting the grammar. otherwise it has been fairly fun and has kept me entertained."
"11604",1074223087,"Fun casual game.  But items you buy with gems, or premium currency, don't work."
"11605",1074251093,"The UI can use some work but the little animations, sounds, and characters are so polished. I am hooked."
"11606",1074251093,"i love this game, it’s hard to keep me interested in games after a while but the cute characters kept me playing ☺️"
"11607",1074251093,"I like the mini clips and the powers follow the character traits. Downside of this game is that the English translations need work."
"11608",1074278256,"Can we post our music mobile instead of using the freaking computer like quit playing around it it’s a lot of people out here that want to manage more then play n fans it’s more to it"
"11609",1074278256,"As with the others-no photo changes...? Or photo at all? A bit weak on this end. Completely agree with one person about needing ability to message people. I mean—it is an app—on a phone—with music to share/listen to/review/—so like social media in a way, no? Let me be able to tell another artist to keep it coming; or allow a fan to ask the track on a mix. Perhaps someone’s trying to book me-mane!!! Also it’s just good PR to be able to speak with your fellow creators and or followers. As for the profile info-sorry that bugs me. Actually so much so it got me to write this...(!) I write maybe one review for an app a year if that hahaha. Else, FR FR I dig it."
"11610",1074278256,"I make my music on my phone (most of the time) since I am a ghostwriter for EDM/house/etc.  I don’t mix down or master my tracks. Having to get on a desktop every time I need to upload is a hassle. Will recommend once this is a feature."
"11611",1074311276,"I've been using WRIO for about three weeks.  The first major re-think of a mobile keyboard I think actually works.  Very high learning curve as you might imagine (at least for this old man trying to learn new tricks), but my accuracy is way up, I think my speed will be, and I find it hard to go back to the standard keyboard in the few apps it won't work with. The use of swipe for capitalixation, delete and restore, and to reassign keys to special charactors mean all of these tasks can be done with fewer key strokes and one-handed. Woth the effort to learn the modified layout, and highly recommended."
"11612",1074311276,"I love the larger key layout on this, but im havng trouble with the auto-correct function in that it seems to be not behaving as I would expect it to. For example, if i want to say that im ready to do something, the i's don't get capitalized and i don't always get the apostrophies to insert where they should, so i am having to go back to manually correct the multiple mistakes i make by not swiping up or holding the long press as I need to do. I have the auto-correct turned on in the settings, but it doesn't seem to do what I expect it to do. Im on an iphone 7, did I miss something or what? BTW, I love the privacy that is promised, but Im used to seeing the auto-correct options above the keyboard and being able to tap the correction from there. So, what am i missing?"
"11613",1074311276,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Difficult to swipe backwards (in fact I CANT) to delete unwanted text! IMPOSSIBLE to do.  I’ve wasted more time trying to delete.... Special characters? Nope can’t get them either! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME! DONT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!"
"11614",1074333609,"Love the mod adder"
"11615",1074333609,"When I tried the app out on mobile it didn’t work. I couldn’t get lucky blocks, I couldn’t  get anything it got really annoying."

"11619",1074403804,"I love the game and playoff mode makes the time fly by, but could you please make a roster update? Since the 2019 offseason, the rosters for all the teams are severely outdated and could use an update"
"11620",1074432267,"I found this game very enjoyable.  No bugs, no glitches,color good story line was good. Like to see more of this kind. Grandma Betty54"
"11621",1074432267,"This is a good game.i would give it a 4."
"11622",1074432267,"Nothing special here. Lousy graphics"
"11623",1074866833,"We found this app during our stay in Japan.  So looking forward to watching Japanese tv back home, but turned out almost nothing is available for US market."
"11624",1074866833,"This app was ruined, it now detects VPNs. You can’t even watch with a VPN here in Japan."
"11625",1074866833,"海外在住なので見られるようになって嬉しいですが、もっと他のチャンネルも見れるようになってほしいです！"
"11626",1074889855,"Fun and well written run n gun platformer. The weapon upgrades are great and the levels are replayable. My only complaint is that it’s not clear how to progress. At some point during the game you need to have enough stars to continue. However I seem to be missing one star (at the ship), yet all previous levels have 3 stars and the high score crown. The game has no cues on what I need to play in order to progress."
"11627",1074889855,"Good job!!! Cool"
"11628",1074889855,"Update the game to adapt the screen to iPhone XR XS  Very entertaining and dynamic. Good graphics. excellent game. I would like more levels or game survival mode. More perks please Example not reloading the weapon or immortality!!! Please."
"11629",1074943747,"As a podcast host and former professor, I’ve always tried to be mindful of the manner in which I speak—which is why I love this app!  LikeSo makes it easy and fun to assess our speech patterns and alter any tendencies that impede effective communication."
"11630",1074943747,"Good app thus far, kinda limited tho. Keep adding to it! Roll out updates more often, add more words to filter out and more features in general.  It’ll take the app a long way. Change is good."
"11631",1074943747,"All they need to add is the ability to change the prep time and speak time as well as the words is filters.  At the very least you need the words Um ect."
"11632",1075068419,"Don’t buy. Crashes constantly, customer service won’t answer, only can blur out certain segments within a video; not continually. Save the 3 dollars."
"11633",1075068419,"Great app, easy to use, fun, different styles of blurring and can decide how much blur to add to a photo."

"11638",1075301033,"This game is not good because it doesn’t connect to their other free games. Very disappointed about this.  It’s not worth the 2.99 I paid."
"11639",1075301033,"This game is fun but I kinda wish they had houses but it is a fun game overall😐"
"11640",1075301033,"Dear My Town,           Please update the game. I am very sorry for asking you sooooooo much. No pressure, it would make me and everyone else who is asking happy 😃. If this is not possible it’s fine, but PLEASE try.😁😆😃🤩😍😄😀🤗👧🏻👧🏻👧🏻👧🏻                                                                           From,                                                                     Gymnast 🐩"
"11641",1075497162,"This game is amazing! It has been the only game I've been playing on my headset, but I have some update ideas.  -where you look press the trigger/screen to move there and in certain spots it stops you to battle geobots.  -add armor to the shop.  -add boss geobots by having the player shoot certain spots of the boss to kill it.  -add different locations to choose from.  EDITED:  -have the more costly armor and lasers be more powerful  -add levels  - add an indicator in levels telling you how many geobots are left to shoot"
"11642",1075497162,"This is an excellent app for getting your feet wet with VR. The ascetics are superb and the gameplay addicting. I look forward to see what else is to come from the developer."
"11643",1075497162,"Although I paired this game with the code on my Google Cardboard, the view is out of focus/double vision. Very disorienting. When I load settings and try to turn on ""Sync with cardboard"", the app crashes."
"11644",1075767316,"小时候最爱玩的游戏。制作精美。每天都可以领登陆奖品。 但是今天遇到了问题，求解决。我一开始玩游戏时，没有绑定账号就开始游戏了，今天突然说需要登录账户，设定了帐号，游戏却要重新开始了，怎样找回玩了很久的帐号？急急，求开发者帮解决啦。"
"11645",1075767316,"Very adorable monopoly game. The characters are so cute. Good way to pass time. Quite addictive :)"
"11646",1075767316,NA
"11647",1075820557,"I think for most of us it starts off a little confusing and slightly frustrating getting a hang of things. But as as soon as you get a hang of things the game gets very addictive. I enjoy how engaging and simple the game is. If your looking for an arcade game to fall in love with then you dont need to look further.  I have 2 suggestions for the Devs. The mechanics are simple and therefor near perfect, but- I would revisit the ""side shot"" and consider buffing it, if not get rid of it as a powerup. Secondly Ive noticed the horizontal hit box on the "" X fighter enemy"" needs a very small adjustment."
"11648",1075820557,"What a fun game! Old school minimalist graphics. Always loved tempest and this has a feel like that. You will get more scores of 0 then you will care to see, but keep coming back for more. Glad I found this one."
"11649",1075820557,"It’s true"
"11650",1075851197,"This is a great tabletop game.  As good of an app.  No interruptions or bugs.  Just buy it.  You will get your money's worth in a day."
"11651",1075851197,"I randomly found out about this game and love it.    It’s honestly just a relaxing game.    I admit I had to do the tutorial twice.   It’s not really all that difficult to understand there are just quite a few moving parts to the game and I couldn’t figure out what the medium level Ai always had so many buttons!"
"11652",1075851197,"Huge fan of Patchwork one of my favorite games to bust out on the table . Simple, quick, strategic and fun! Mobile works great but recommend the physical game for the full experience!"
"11653",1075853478,"I paid for this app and assumed it will update new characters, but I am wrong."
"11654",1075853478,"It's outdated and forever will be.  They basically just stole my money."
"11655",1075853478,"This app is a total flop. Just like the game itself. It's unbelievable that this is the ""official"" frame data app where it's not even updated anymore. I'm so disappointed with Capcom and SFV."
"11656",1075872386,"My friend showed me this game and I loved it. It was very fun to play and just overall a good game. I got pretty good and unlocked a lot of levels. But once I got to the Tuscany level the game got unnecessarily hard to play. Getting the baby crabs was nearly impossible. Even just trying to pass the level got frustrating. Very upsetting. Playing this game with my friend was a lot of fun because we could work together to pass each level. At first I had a goal to collect ALL of the baby crabs no matter what. But that was easier said than done. Now I’m considering deleting this game. Not fun anymore, and having to watch ads before every level is a little too much. I don’t really recommend."
"11657",1075872386,"My six-year-old granddaughter loves to play Mr. Crab 2, and is getting good at it. But when she chose to “watch a video” to win something from the vending machine, I was dismayed to see the R-rated content in the “cartoon” that played! It portrayed sexual acts, and even in a graphic-novel style of art, this is NOT appropriate for children. It is not necessary to expose users to this type of content with NO OPTION TO ESCAPE, other than quitting the app. I went to my Settings and now have blocked all advertising. Too bad."
"11658",1075872386,"This is the best game I have"

"11662",1075920778,"Octopussy is good critter"
"11663",1075920778,"This game is super fun and addictive. The ads aren’t too crazy and it’s not overly challenging. My only issue if that the game has crashed multiple times already. Either it will freeze, or bring me to a pitch black or white screen. This is the only reason why I didn’t rate 5 stars, so I hope you can fix that!"

"11673",1076093996,"This is a scam - the developer should be sued for not disclaiming you don’t get to play the old arcade games"
"11674",1076292594,"Fun game, but it lags a ton and has way too many ads. Also, there is a bug where the ""Tap to Play"" button doesn't disappear after the game starts."
"11675",1076292594,"It's fun for like a few minutes but gets boring after and the ads are just so annoying but I have a solution for that just turn your phone on airplane mode."
"11676",1076292594,"I was playing this and got kicked off my flight and escorted to a screening area designated by the TSA. Wait until you're not at an airport before playing this!! Fun though"

"11679",1076350557,"Usually I never bother to write a review, but for this game I must.  This game is insanely addictive and you feel so good after beating the level you’re on.  This is what I do now when I need to pass time.  My only recommendation is to add more things you can buy with stars; I have around 3,000 that I can’t spend.  Possibly more themes or allow us to use stars for a second chance instead of adverts. Download this, youll love it!"
"11680",1076402133,"Been playing this for quite some time and always love coming back to it.  Just finished level 270. Pretty satisfied. I don’t remember which ones were the hardest but I swear there were a couple I was stuck on for weeks. One in particular stumped me so hard I quit the game for a while. Anyway, really a great game. Totally worth the time."
"11681",1076402133,"This is a well-designed game, and I love that they also added features to make it accessible for color-blindness."

"11687",1076431520,"UNBELIEVABLY short, even at the sale price. Shame, because the game, what there was of it was great.  Buying BF games is like gambling.  Be prepared to lose your money.  Long time customers are probably familiar with their abysmal customer ""service"".  A new low for me was the latest Dark Dimensions: Homecoming.  There were problems with the game.  Big surprise, right?  What was new was that instead of their usual do nothing, deny the problem, or blame the customer, they did somethings different.  They did the right thing and updated the app....NOT.  Actually, they did fix the app.  The problem is that instead of issuing it as an update for those of us who had paid the broken app, they released the fixed version as a SEPARATE app. That way, they get rid of those pesky negative reviews so they can attract new buyers while completely screwing over the old buyers.  They gave it a shiny new release date and 1.0 version number but the old broken app is still right there in the App Store.  Also, this week, I discovered that the old buy once play forever....NOT... problem of the supposed past still exists.  I went to open a game I had bought a while ago and it will not work on iOS 8 or newer.  I never played this game.  I bought a bunch of games during the last big sale.  Can't get a refund because it's been over six months (from Apple, who have been great about giving BF refunds versus BF who not only never refunds, but makes you jump through stupid hoops with the promise of a refund, or otherwise strings you along in various ways until you give up). The multiple 1 star reviews clearly show that it is an issue with iOS but, again, they haven't fixed it AND they are continuing to sell an app they know won't work on current devices or older devices with current operating systems.  They'll probably never change but there are alternatives which other reviewers have mentioned.  Goodbye BF."

There are these super advanced creatures called northern men but they use magic because reasons.  The inuit kid saying we must stop the northern man was unintentionally hilarious -  i played him like a beat box.  And the driving game had horrendous, tear-your-hair-out controls.  The bonus game hung on me and i felt relieved."
"11689",1076440502,"This game is impossible! I can't get past the start of Checkpoint 2 in Zone 2!  This game is not A.P.E.X! It's Y.O.U.S.U.C.K.P.E.X! The game sucked so I restarted it. And it's the same thing.  You just gotta remove the enemies from my way, I die every time from that!  Toppluv'nope scones! Fix this game today and crappy holidays to A.P.E.X! All of the games are fine."
"11690",1076440502,"Short story mode, too many glitches, and you can't even buy the ball you want without the game making you buy another one. Absolute Games   -> Absolute Trash."
"11691",1076440502,"The first level is easy then it gets EXTREMELY difficult."

"11695",1076468537,"This game is beautiful, relaxing, and so cute! It’s a great way to de stress, especially if you’re someone who wants a game to kind of fidget with but not necessarily be a challenge. The different moths are so cute and I’m loving collecting them!"
"11696",1076468537,"Fun simple game"
"11697",1076468537,"I would really recommend this. I use this when I’m studying and doing 15 minute breaks, or to wind down before bed. The characters are adorable! You also get free stickers for your text messages included with this. Get Starlight, and you won’t be disappointed or dissatisfied."
"11698",1076540771,"I think this game is horribly set up in every way! It looked fun but was not expecting this! I was so disappointed!"
"11699",1076540771,"This is a good idea but it is not good it turns off like every 20 seconds and you should be Abel to chose how hard it is and to many adds I give it like half a star (but my iPad won't let me)"
"11700",1076540771,"I absolutely love this game! It's so addicting and so fun! I beat it 2 times . If anyone knows a game like this pls tell me"
"11701",1076615810,"Fun and challenging on many levels. Better than WB1."
"11702",1076615810,"... for those of us who have completed WB2, I for one, would pay for a new Word Brain 3 as long as it starts with difficult or extremely hard levels.   Feedback?   Please respond & thank you!"
"11703",1076615810,"Why is the game eating my hints?  First of all I never got the hints that I earned during the summer challenge,  then today I spun the wheel and earned 2 more hints and I only received one."
"11704",1076619087,"There is a ton of great content offered through this service for a very reasonable price.  My only issue is the ability to search for that content through the app.  The “collections” tab makes content easier to find, but not everything always pops up when searching for something specific via the search tab.  I recently dropped the subscription through the app and added History Vault as a channel through my Prime account so I can stream through my television.  However, I find navigating Prime difficult as it is, and it remains a hassle to find content through this method as well.  It would be nice if I could still utilize the regular app to find content despite subscribing via Amazon Prime, because I actually find the Vault app easier to navigate than Prime.  Having the app available on more devices would also be nice as well.  All in all though, it’s fantastic service, I just wish it was easier to navigate."
"11705",1076619087,"I was and still am very excited about all the documentaries available to watch. I absolutely love,love the content. However,when I try to stream to my tv it stops playing at the exact moment I hook it up to my adapter. I have a brand new Apple 8 and I realize there are other ways to stream but I’ve been streaming all other accounts (Netflix,HBONow and Hulu) endlessly and with zero issues just using the adapter. For instance,I will be watching a show and as soon as I plug up the adapter it stops playing. I’ve tried multiple different combinations (hooking up first,last etc) to try and “trick” the app to continue playing or to start playing but when I hook up the adapter to my computer phone it ALWAYS INSTANTLY stops playing. This is soooo frustrating because I really love the content! I love history! Unfortunately though if I can’t stream to my tv I will have to unsubscribe. Please help me figure out why this is happening. Please don’t tell me to get Apple TV or Chromecast or whatever other ways to stream because this adapter has been working great for every other thing I watch, even You Tube,EVERYTHING except your app😌 Please help me understand what to do to fix so I can watch all these awesome documentaries and stay (become) a loyal,HAPPY customer. Please and thank you so much in advance for your attention and help resolving this issue."
"11706",1076619087,"The very first time that I saw the history channel, when we first got cable television I thought it was the absolute greatest thing ever but ever since then instead of the channel being devoted to its name and living up to its name it’s become a never ending time slot of meaningless shows and programming that has absolutely nothing to do with any type of history, not US History, not world History, not human history just nothing! It’s really sad to know what it once was and see what it has become. This App is exactly what I would expect from the history channel and now that I have it I will never watch it on TV again. It’s awesome because I can even pick and choose my favorite type of History and the period of time that I most like. This is a win win for me and if it weren’t for the rest of my family and the fact that I am living on a disability retirement I would now get rid of cable television and save some money for having to pay for both and be perfectly happy with having this as my entertainment and also at the same time a wonderful opportunity to learn things that I had missed or overlooked in history. Please never stop expanding and reaching for all of History, and all of its many faucets, and uniquenesses. I am completely satisfied. Thank you so very very much."

"11736",1077024869,"The game will not open that glitch needs fixed it’s been like that for 2 months now."
"11737",1077051430,"This is a well-designed game, it's fun and easy to progress without having to spend real life money, and it has good replayability - as is essential for a game like this. However, be warned that this game crashes after every video ad, whether it be to get free in-game currency or to continue a run after dying. I have yet to watch a video ad that actually rewarded me for sitting through the entire thing, it always just freezes the app or outright crashes it. I would still give it a go, cause the ads are optional and it is a good game."

"11741",1077056423,"Okay, so the story is a soap opera for teens and bored adults, but the hidden object games and puzzles are fun. Most puzzles are just right for young kids aged 9... no surprise there. No challenge for older players. The graphics are lovely, though. A game like this will keep me leisurely occupied for a couple of hours each night. Near the end, I was eager to just put the finale on such a tortured plot. On the upside, this was more Perry Mason than anything. Glad not to have to deal with dark magic for a change. If I even detect that stuff in a title, cover picture, description, or a review, I move on to find something with some daylight. I would give this game 4 stars for the first half, then 3.5 stars from midway through the bonus chapter. The souvenirs were a nice touch."
"11742",1077056423,"I usually like the games in this series.  This one is so blah.  I've been trying to play it since it came out and just can't.  I continue to load new games or reload old games before coming back to this.   It has incorrect names on the HOG's. It will name an object, but the object is actually something else. (Necklace is actually a comb)  I could overlook that if the game was fun, it's not. Just boring, almost awful!"
"11743",1077142297,"I’m happy to catch all the Pokémon so I will not update it was fine how it was before."
"11744",1077142297,"I’ve had this game for a year and a half, and keep coming back to it to kill time. Fortunately I had it pre-update and I’ve never updated it to have the weird fusions, so I’m still playing with the 151! I like this game a lot."
"11745",1077142297,"I agree it used to feel better to play when it was catch em, but still pretty much is the same game as its original ""Catch Em"", just with the sprites altered"

The message will still show up if you open the app but will not send a notification.

"11749",1077483835,"First, my wife and I have played dozens of Big Fish hidden object games for years on a 3rd generation iPad.  We recently got a deal we couldn't pass up on an iPad Pro.  No, I didn't write that to brag.  I wrote that because many of the reviews are commenting about the screen load times.  Well, of course - it's a very new game with big graphics demands.  Look at the download size!  Sure you can complain, but there are hundreds of older Big Fish games for the older devices.  For those of us lucky enough to have newer devices, it's wonderful to have a game that shows what they are capable of.  There is all kinds of extra little animation bits. It's fun to just touch an object to see what will happen.  Okay, not all are relevant to the game story, but it certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere.  We are thrilled that Big Fish took the extra effort to make a game that really takes advantage of 'beefier' hardware.  If you've got it, this game is a must have."
"11750",1077483835,"Especially the Bonus game which is almost unplayable in spots.  This ruined it for me.   I have an IPad 2 if that makes a difference."
"11751",1077483835,"I am so frustrated with this game!! It has a great storyline, but it takes way too long to load into another area. Also, the sensitivity to get something is awful!! I ended up deleting the game and starting over 3 times!!! I finally gave up and I was really enjoying the storyline."
"11752",1077565500,"This game is fun, but I really miss the Halloween edition with the decorations and music"

"11759",1077590028,"Game was fun until I got to Tredecillions of Dollars. Once I got to Quattuordecillion, progress started to slow down, at Quindecillion, things got super slow, progress completely stops once you get to Sexdecillion, and game becomes almost unplayable if you can’t progress. Please fix this developer. It’s no fun to sit on the game just to click on presents hoping to get enough gold for a 3x multiplier just to speed things up a little bit."
"11760",1077590028,"Hasn’t been updated in 3 years. Played for a long time but updates never came. Not worth your time."
"11761",1077611503,"Fairly enjoyable-my only question; how can you possibly fulfill/use all the character designs when you can only make less than half a page of original characters?"
"11762",1077611503,"Background music is easily the worst I've ever heard in a video game.  You will want to mute it within minutes of play.  Unlike Game Dev story, which I loved, you can't increase speed of the game.  So a lot of the game is just waiting.  I couldn't take the wait time after 15 min of play.  The game is dead to me until they let users speed it up."
"11763",1077611503,"This game is similar to other games after a while I get bored of doing the same thing over and over again maybe if they added some twist I would be more interested in trying to restore the purchase now"

"11770",1077829105,"This app is very much like quizlet and the good part is that it’s fast and quick to help you learn info. However, the questions aren’t in the AP multiple choice format. There are no true or false questions on the exam, but many of the questions in the app have this format. Adding real prep multiple choice questions from practice APUSH exams would be really helpful so students can have a basic idea of the format. Other than that, I was that the app was organized into the different periods which was helpful. Also the option of looking at info regarding your wrong answer really helped. I would recommend this app."
"11771",1077829105,"A lot of people give this app a hard time because they think it’s meant to give stimulus based questions, but it’s not. However, it is perhaps the most useful tool I had for the exam since it helped me identify what time periods I needed to brush up on #letsgetthisbread"
"11772",1077829105,"This app looks helpful yes. I was looking for help with reviewing for the AP US history exam and I found this app to help review. PLEASE DONT BUY IT. This app is a multiple choice review app and the bad part is that it asks questions that are too specific and not helpful in studying concepts and events that will be in the AP exam. It will ask a question about who passed a certain bill which is not helpful compared to a question that helps you review what the act actually is. I would NOT recommend this app. Don't waste your time and money on this app when you could be using other resources to study that are actually helpful. One last time DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I am genuinely triggered after buying this app."

Can you please try to make it more colorful and not to fast. Thank you"

"11790",1078203264,"Every time I want to play the game, I have to uninstall then reinstall. It wouldn’t bother me too much... but since the game is over 150 MB, it won’t let me download it without an internet connection. That means I can’t play it whenever I want. When I have played it, it has been a great time."
"11791",1078203772,"Don’t ask me to give you a review."
"11792",1078203772,"I paid 4.99 for the started pack which should also have removed the adds. It did not. Apple would not refund my money and told me to contact the developer which is impossible with the links. Do not waste your money."

"11796",1078297893,"Łove the characters"
"11797",1078412469,"Apparently the developer has decided to not update this app any further. It certainly shows. MobileMouse spanks this in every conceivable way."
"11798",1078412469,"I’ve been playing with this app for about a half an hour now and it seems to work well. I’ve been using it to navigate my computer, play Sims 4, Tropico, and Orwell. It takes s bit getting used to, but it’s working quite nicely!"
"11799",1078412469,"I tried connecting this with my chromebook and even though it says it is compatible with chromebooks, every time it fails. I shouldn’t have wasted my money. This is bs."
"11800",1078553808,"The gameplay is ok, but the game is buggy and crashes alot.  It’s been crashing with each patch for over a year now so I guess they don’t really care.  Don’t expect much help from the customer service either."
"11801",1078553808,"I really loved this game but now I’m stuck and cannot continue my love for it. I  returned a letter to some guy dressed like Robinhood in the Royal Capitol Grandshelt and now I cannot get out. The screen turns black anytime I go to a door or exit and does not return me to the World. I have to restart but it happens all over again so I am literally stuck. So sad. I am going to delete and reboot from the apps. I’m hoping this will work."

"11807",1078560336,"This game is basic and free with a short add after every other death.  Anyway I had this glitch where I could go right through the obstacles instead of hitting them and dying. I had no way to die so I kept going and after it got to 381196m, the game finally crashed. It was going Super fast by then. It saved the high score but not the coins.   But yeah fun game👍🏼"
"11808",1078560336,"I Cabot discribe how much fun this game is also give us more ships"
"11809",1078573759,"Fun game. Worth the play."
"11810",1078573759,"It’s quick and fun"
"11811",1078573759,"Great game but what’s going on with the new content. There’s been no new levels for decades now"
"11812",1078591208,"اللعبه جيده وحماسيه لكن السعر مبالغ فيه وهي بحاجه لتحديث دائما لانها احيانا اشوف اللعبه ما اقدر اكملها وبعد التحديث اجد حلول ..."
"11813",1078591208,"لعبه جداً شيقه ورائعه وتم شراء كامل الاجزاء   اتمنى لكم التوفيق 😘😘😘"
"11814",1078591208,"ممتعة و حماسية ولكن عدد المراحل قليل جداً أتمنى زيادتها بتحديث في القريب العاجل، و لكم جزيل الشكر."
"11815",1078599766,"I downloaded this game to try it out and see how it is it’s absolutely terrible!! Its so weird, complicated, tiny(the hoverboard), hard to control, goes wayy to fast and if there was a zero star button i would press it also the test is so weird nothing like the real game and the testing is so loud and i hate it!! If u like the game im sorry if this is offensive to u but this is my opinion"
"11816",1078599766,"This will wast your time on this stupid stuff do get it I repeat don’t get it you just put two fingers on it and makes noises that’s it ???!!! Really ?!"
"11817",1078599766,"This game is absolute crap. What the heck’s your fingers for these days. Shoutouts to Jake, Aj and Colin. I love hover boards, but this. They have taken it just a little to far"
"11818",1078643602,"Game is relaxing you use ur brain the higher the level the harder it is. Challenging and a great game."
"11819",1078643602,"Seriously? Your adds play sounds even when my phone is on vibrate and sounds are set to off. If you’re going to pull that crap you’re getting uninstalled but more importantly you should be ashamed of yourselves."
"11820",1078643602,"When I have to listen to telemundo to play a game.....I’m done!"
"11821",1078677054,"My new favorite - logic puzzle, brain teaser, whatever you want to call it. Elegantly simple - perfect"
"11822",1078677054,"This one is easier to just swipe with less strategy than some of their other games. Whether that's a plus or minus depends on your style."
"11823",1078677054,"Nice, thoughtful. A bit frustrating to get stuck and not be able to advance to try another level. And I don't see a map to skip to a level instead of tap tap tapping one by one. But otherwise very very nice design and playability."

"11827",1078819328,"So I doubt this review will get read but this game was amazing and it’s a shame that it’s ending but after the game ends you should be able to pick a Pokémon in your library and transfer it to Pokémon Go this is just an idea but a lot of people would probably love this idea."
"11828",1078819328,"Hate how this is unfair I do a hundred damage to the opponent and he does a 1 star move and he wins but when he does one hundred damage and I get a 1 star move he wins and the timer really needs to be removed"
"11829",1078819328,"The game is AMAZING I love the concept. But (unless it’s on my phone) whenever I unlock a UX it doesn’t show up where you select the Pokémon. I bought the (Mega Swampert set) and I only get the EX and the UX doesn’t show up. The UX only shows up in the fusion area. ("
"11830",1078967478,"in the adds of these games they make it look like you can make the best sand castle an save the animals an in the add it makes you think it’s so fun but i say save your i cloud storage it takes a lot of data an it’s a TOTAL let down first you can only do the dress up sand castle and the shell necklace and it’s always glitching i had to restart 35 times just to get past the welcome screen an when i first got it wouldn’t even work and i can’t update it. it’s so frustrating and you can’t delete it i hate this game and i recommend to everyone who wanted or is thinking about getting it here is my advice DON’T BUY IT and the videos take forever so never get and if you can delete it please tell me how .         THIS GAME IS POOP💩💩💩💩💩"
"11831",1078967478,"Each area costs money. And even when you make an in-app purchase the ads will continue FREQUENTLY!! For a 4.99 purchase turn the stupid ads off. Ridiculous"
"11832",1078967478,"I just love 💗 the game '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the only thing that I don’t like is that the app doesn’t have all of the places are  available."
"11833",1079094909,"Crashes when trying to display camera roll. Help screen won't advance. Controls seem sluggish at times. I hope future updates fix problems because it has great potential."
"11834",1079094909,"App poorly responds to swiping and touch gestures."
"11835",1079094909,"Im on an iPhone 6s with iOS 9.3.1 and this app keeps crashing. Requesting a refund."
"11836",1079178967,"I wanted to be Peridot"
"11837",1079178967,"I love playing this game, I also like that you can have your own custom gem, I just have one thing to ask. In a later update, could you like put fusion into the game. I just think it would be so cool to see your character fuse with one ☝️ of the crystal gems 💎 or even with Steven."
"11838",1079178967,"//Firstly, I want to say I highly recommend this game.  The thing I like most about this is that you don’t need to spend money to access all the songs you just need skill. Secondly, the difficulty curve on the songs are not that insane, did I perfectly beat any of the later songs, no, But I did manage to get three stars on every level within two nights. And to be honest I beat it this quick because I loved the game and was completely into the music. Wanting to help Steven and the Gems was another driving factor. (Anyone named Steven who creates a band named Steven and the Gems, I get 25% profit) But yeah this is one of the most fun, honestly free games I have found on the App Store."
"11839",1079253434,"I played for free episode 1 it was great so I decided to buy the second part, the payment went trough everything was perfect but then it said that the 2 part couldn’t be installed. This game stole my money. 😠"
"11840",1079253434,"I just downloaded this game and I played the first episode and then purchased the rest of the episode and it will not download. I don't know what's going but I am not happy. If the games downloaded I would have given 4 or five stars because it is a great game."
"11841",1079253434,"I paid for all three episodes and now the content won’t download!!!!!! How do I get my money back??"
"11842",1079321578,"This game is absolutely outstanding when you think you have reached everything you can upgrade or do it the game you get to a new spot and it hits you with more fun if you get friends together and play irl or in game it makes it even better I hope that they implement clans soon like they say they are if they keep this up this will be a masterpiece of a game I never take time out of my day to write a review for a game unless I think it deserves one please try this game out my name is PxixmxpDaddy add me!"
"11843",1079321578,"The only thing I don’t like is the you can’t free run. You have to click a spot on the ground and your character runs there, then stops until you click another spot. Not a horrible issue, but when you have a torch and trying to burn down an enemies boat while they try and attack you it gets kinda tough."
"11844",1079321578,"Where is clan and where is update?"
"11845",1079464948,"First of all, let me start by saying this is one of my favorite games EVER!!! What I’m having a problem with is I upgraded my phone and couldn’t transfer my progress. I had about 150 levels completed. Please tell me how I can get those completed levels back and not have to start all over."
"11846",1079464948,"This app. Is. So. Good. It’s calm and relaxing, makes you think, so far, ad free, and you can have endless levels with the QR code system. Best app in a while. What more could you ask for. Thank you"
"11847",1079464948,"This game is one of the best mobile games I’ve played in a while you can’t find many games like it you can create you can play normal games and you don’t have to pay anything for it. I really recommend this game if you love to create stuff and if you love to solve puzzles in my opinion this game is good for anyone."
"11848",1079527526,"It is an absolute must have for any Asterix fan. I just wish it existed in french. Some improvements are needed because it crashes a lot but still... I just love it"
"11849",1079527526,"This game is very cool but it has 1 problem: it’s to hard to find food. The rest is perfect"
"11850",1079527526,"First...I have been a fan of the Asterix graphic novel series since my preadolescence and was very excited to see a new game based on the characters and concept.  Second...after downloading this two days ago I have yet to get past building my first shelter. Why? The game will NOT do anything after tapping the red arrow or anything else, actually. The arrow acts like it has been pressed, but nothing happens. Yes, I even downloaded the latest update. If you can fix this so I can play the star rating may increase...but until then..."
"11851",1079607960,"I just opened this app and the layout and photos are simply beautiful. Well done!"
"11852",1079607960,"Pretty much the website and the website is better. Really hopping this would be more."
"11853",1079607960,"The app itself is beautiful. However, I found it is very hard to read the small fonts. They are not adjustable."
"11854",1079643338,"I play A LOT of these adventure, hidden objects games.  This is the best I’ve played in a long time. It’s truly challenging!  Most of these games you find objects you can use in 1-2 rooms, but this one really makes you look at the whole game as the big picture, and the mini-games are the best I’ve ever encountered. Each one is a big puzzle you need to solve by figuring out the micro-puzzles within.   This is not a cash grab game, or one made for kids to solve. It’s complex and challenging. The graphics aren’t always great, but the story is intriguing and complex. Worth the money, especially if it’s on sale.   I just wish I had played the first Ravenhearst before this one. I feel like I might have enjoyed the story better."
"11855",1079643338,"Yep"
"11856",1079643338,"I love you"
"11857",1079673793,"Challenging too!"
"11858",1079673793,"Boring & tedious. HOs are good but puzzles are not interesting. Storyline is predictable; map necessary since clues are not all that clear. I found myself just using the map to advance. Not much thinking involved. Graphics were good. Game played well, but when zooming the game kept counting screen movement as clicks. No where near as good as some of the classics like the Drawn series."
"11859",1079673793,"Another addition to the EiPix series.  I gave the last addition a 3+ for reasons stated on that review.  However, although this was similar in many ways, it was more fine-tuned, the plot held more interest, the music was a bit more on-target for the theme, and everything just ""worked"" better.  I gave this new addition a 4+, since it still does not top a few other companies offerings.  Keep up the improvements EiPix!  Recommendation: Buy on sale and enjoy."
"11860",1079800951,"good game"
"11861",1079800951,"可以给我留系方式吗客服"
"11862",1079800951,"可以可以可以"
"11863",1079843974,"It is the perfect mobile game. It’s engaging and has a nice consistency with the level designs. You also can’t just hop on and get to the higher worlds, you have to work for it."
"11864",1079843974,"I don’t play anymore because the “make sure your spells don’t miss” challenge is way too hard."
"11865",1079843974,"I give this game 5/5 stars. It’s honestly amazing. Whenever I’m bored I can pull out my phone and play it. I’m still working my way to getting all the upgrades but I love how the quests keep going. And the different spells and different quests you beat to get higher and higher is amazing. It would be cool to see a survival mode to see how long you can survive or even an online mode where you play against each other and summon the enemies to attack them. Overall the game is great. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"11866",1079852672,"The app was not a good one but it was so good"
"11867",1079852672,"I cant sync facebook with my game it has an error but the game is ok"
"11868",1079852672,"Fun to play and you don’t need to spend money if you don’t want too"
"11869",1079974548,"Great game but needs more levels and difficulty harder! I finished it in 2 days!!!❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️"
"11870",1079974548,"Fish 🐟 is vaery sensutive and the cat 🐱 is mean but fun"
"11871",1079974548,"My 4 year old son is madly in love with this app. It is great conceptually and a perfect challenge for him. However the app freezes over and over and over again. He will be mostly to his goal, and then he cannot move the pipe pieces anymore. They are stuck, frozen, and he has to restart the level. This is frustrating him and thus making all of us miserable. I had to take the app off the tablet. It was that bad. It is possible part of the issue is with the 2 options of spinning the pipes, e.g. tapping or manually spinning them. He prefers spinning to tapping (makes intuitive sense). But his pieces freeze more than if I play and use tapping to spin and adjust the pieces.   We really want to love this. I hope it can be made less glitchy so we can use it again. Thanks!"
"11872",1079977734,"As a big fan, I will pay for their games before even playing, because I KNOW they'll be worth the money! I even have the app that shows me all their games, plus there's a category for games on sale. This title was great also, except no bonus chapter. I have also learned, to my financial disadvantage, to be careful if I am buying a game that is in their 'deals' section. Sometimes it doesn't give me the option of purchasing immediately...just 'play now'. When getting one of these, you need to go into the game right away and purchase the full game. If you don't, and it's a few days before you are able to play, the game may not be on sale at that time. Then, as what happened to me 3 times, you will pay the full price. I think that if you download it while on sale, it should still be able to purchase it at sale price, even if you don't get to play it immediately."
"11873",1079977734,"So today’s deal of the day is this game in a new forum...I purchased this and I am looking at the receipt but this new version says I did not purchase!!!!! What a scam...shame on you BF!!!!!!!!!!!  Be Leary of this company it is going downhill FAST!!!!"
"11874",1079977734,"It wasn't until halfway that the game started crashing in each scene, which is frustrating.  Domain really want to delete it and start all over? I paid for it, so if that's my only choice, but I'd sure like to see a new version or a fix for it. Its a great game, but starting over, and over and over is distracting from the storyline and the fun."
"11875",1080114119,"Keeps trying to sell me some sort of expensive web subscription to use it, not just for $30, but for $30 a year. Nope."
"11876",1080114119,"Was able to cut and edit as wished but now today says login for 3 free cutouts so I guess they’ve put a paywall now. Sad."
"11877",1080114119,"I’ll use another app.  GREED!"
"11878",1080169657,"This a great game, with lots of cool effects and colors. But I NEED IT IN IPHONE X SIZE!!!! Gotta get that full experience!"
"11879",1080169657,"Este juego está entre mis preferidos. No tiene muchos niveles pero su simpleza me encanta ."
"11880",1080169657,"This game is totally the style of game I love and is going down as my favorite 2018 mobile game I have played. Would totally recommend if you are into any mobile game that takes a little time to master to have a lot of fun"
"11881",1080243808,"Congratulations! You've turned a once charming and heartwarming sim into a run-of-the-mill clicker on phones. I used to be a huge proponent of this game back on 360. Now I'm not so sure you guys deserve it. The free to play wall is ridiculously unbalanced."
"11882",1080243808,"I enjoyed this on Xbox 360 even if it was difficult, but the iOS version is too easy. All machines are available from the start, and watching ads boosts your profits, so in about an hour you will have a fully stocked, fully upgraded arcade with high customer satisfaction. Am I missing something for deeper gameplay? I am happy to see this bide dev expand to iOS but sad to see this game dumbed down."
"11883",1080243808,"I love the game. Problem is, It crashes a lot. Also when you watch an ad for a speed up the game crashes after the ad is over and try's to go back to the game, and you loss the bonus. It's a free game and fun if it would not crash so much."
"11884",1080248000,"So far so good"
"11885",1080248000,"I loveeee it definitely going to keep purchasing more clothes from here"
"11886",1080248000,"AMAZING!"
"11887",1080257114,"Bad"
"11888",1080257114,"If I pay for something in the app the. I expect to stop seeing ads. I paid. Still seeing ads. 1 star."
"11889",1080257114,"The game is really great but PLLLLLLLEEEEEEEAAAAAASSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE make a new character update"
"11890",1080290867,"I love this game!! I got it yesterday and it turned out extremely fun!! Everyone rate this game 5 stars!!!"
"11891",1080290867,"I love Garfield and the game a lot, it’s very fun but I’m only giving it four stars because there is a glitch, every time I press on a person (usually it happens to the people in the back.) Garfield still sits he doesn’t run to to person, and then the whole time I’m trying to make Garfield come to the person it wastes all my time, so I would really love it if you could fix that problem than I will defiantly change my review and rating to five stars ⭐️"

"11894",1080294836,"I love this game it's so addicting except for two things that are driving me crazy! I wish that you can't get the same ball over and over again. I have a problem with the moon. I've gotten it over 5 times already! Whenever I go to pick it to play, it's always blacked out as if I never got it.🙄"

"11899",1080345135,"This game is FLIPPIN’ DIFFICULT. Every time I play, I die. Every time I die, I rage. And every time I rage, I break something. THIS IS MY 17TH PHONE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"11900",1080345135,"This game is not even a game. It cheats so you can buy the actual game. Don’t waste your time! What a garbage waste of time!"
"11901",1080345135,"This app is somehow featured on the home page but hasn’t been updated for new displays. Garbage ad system of course. Do the work and update your app and maybe people would care."
"11902",1080369552,"I have enjoyed the American Civil War games before this but must say I have completely enjoyed the English version. :) Highly recommended."
"11903",1080369552,"Fun game easy to learn but still challenging."
"11904",1080369552,"Hexwar's basic battle system,  but it seems to keep improving with each game. The combat system has a lot of detail, and now you can really look under the hood and see how it all works, maximize your attacks. The flank attack rules are crucially important in this game, and the different types of cavalry mean you really need to know when to shoot and when to charge.   For those unfamiliar with the English Civil War, it took place at a point  between Middle Ages warfare and the age of Napoleon; Cavalry was still quite strong, but not dominant, either charging with the sword or riding up close, firing off pistols and retiring. Armor was being phased out due to the rise of muskets, and infantry would protect themselves with long pike formations, almost like ancient Greek phalanxes, but they also had lots of musketeers attached to blast away at anyone who came close.  At times this system can start to feel a bit generic, as it's been used for everything from World War II to ancient Rome, but this one felt enough like the period to make it work. When I played the battle of Edgehill, there were big cavalry battles on both flanks, and eventually one wing swept around and hit the Parliamentarian infantry in the rear, that felt right.  Compared to Pike and Shot from Slitherine, this one plays a lot faster and is less detailed, but they each have their advantages; Fire and Fury is way less fiddly, and you have a lot more control over your units; Pike and Shot has a lot more chaos, with units retreating like wild or charging when you don't want them to, historically accurate, but perhaps frustrating to some. Another alternative is Musket Smoke, which is also very very good, and no luck factor involved whatsoever. All in all, it's great that there are three games on 17th century warfare on iOS now!   My only request for Hexwar games at this point would be to add some command and rally rules; then again, the current morale system rewards you for retreating your weak units before they get killed. Still, it often feels like units fight to the last man a lot more than they run.  A big improvement here is that they have cut back on the ""capture control point and receive reinforcements"" mechanic, which really gave a gamey to feel some of the older Hexwar stuff, and it tended to drive the narrative a bit too much. This one is much more like the historical force match -ups, you get what's on the battlefield, and go at it, have to break the other army's line or morale to win. And another big improvement is the really big maps they have now which offer you a lot more ways to go about beating the other army. Well done.  About the only complaint I have with this is that there's no Game Center support. The AI is good enough to make you work for your wins, but I would really love to be playing this against a human opponent!"

I know the super rich have fabulous bunkers in New Zealand.    Could not one bad thing happen to them?  Like painful boils with no medicine to treat?"
"11906",1080434313,"I’m just wondering why it says photo & video when you can’t access your videos or shoot a video 🤔 I tried to ask for support but it took me to an unrelated link? 😮 I see that it’s just shown in the category."

Quite a few people actually thought I had portrait mode and were shocked when I mentioned this app was the reason. The auto detect isn’t perfect obviously, but it does a great majority of the highlighting work for you. Clean it up a bit and bam, beautiful Bokeh effects! Def recommend!"
"11908",1080465588,"Customizable settings, variety of inventive HOPs, beautiful graphics, long-playing, responsive interactive Hint button. All in all, a wonderful game!"

"11910",1080465588,"Have had to delete game 3 times due to it freezing up. Had to start from stretch . Not happy about that. I'm now trying this for the third time hope it works. Appears to be a good game but just can't play it all the way through because it keeps freezing."

"11913",1080487957,"Ok let me start here and say that this game is not for people who don’t have patience. This game can be really addictive. I have read the 1 star comments and I am here to tell you that there are no reasons to not like this game unless you aren’t patient. Being honest the one star reviews are really dumb reasons (sorry for whoever wrote them) and some are just emojis. I think those people are just mad at themselves because they can’t play it right. Once you get into it more it can be pretty fun. In my option you should get this game.😄"
"11914",1080533223,"Worth paying for! Loads of fun, simple to play. Takes a bit to master.  Loads of achievements worth doing and fully supported by ads.  Never have to spend a dime.  Fans of the shoot em genre don't hesitate to try."

"11923",1080608190,"Galaxy reaver is a great game it has many great features such as the great graphics, the good designs of the ships, that it also has a simple story line. The only thing that I don’t like very much is that, as of now, I am still waiting for the multi player part of the game to come out. I started about a year ago and it said that multiplayer was coming out soon but after about a year still nothing.  Other than that it is a great game to play."

"11928",1080767538,"I just LOVE this app! I cannot stop playing this. I would never rate this app 1 Star down! I figured out that there were settings, so it is so easy. The states are very cute.

The only thing I would change is the game can crash a lot and get disconnected from the Internet back-and-forth back-and-forth please fix this...."

"11935",1080973177,"I have played the majority of kairosoft games and have loved them all. This is the first one I truly don't like. It gives you all the usually kairosoft features which are still present in this game. But the actually gameplay of the matches is flawed. The Cpu player(s) seem to move and play realistically, like they have a goal in mind. On the other hand you will often find your player running around in circles and waiting for no reason to charge up their swing. When playing doubles your players will have no idea what each other is doing and will basically stand right next to each other leaving the rest of the court open as the cpu players spread out and play realistically. Stats aren't a huge factor in this game as you will always be at a disadvantage due to the lack of ai in your own players. Only buy this game if you want to be frustrated and disheartened by losing to players with worse stats and equipment."
"11936",1080973177,"A Revolutionary Leap Forward for Kairosoft!  ...Just Kidding! Come on, we all know why we're here– Kairosoft returns with yet ANOTHER 'Nearly' Identical sequel that's just as hopelessly addictive as all the others. The players stats in this one have a bit more depth than in the previous entries. The wide variety of ""Styles"" available for your players, plus a pretty extensive list of equip-able items to unlock means you might actually need some strategy to get through the late game."
"11937",1080973177,"It's very addicting. One thing I think you should add is when you buy something, it should ask if you really want to purchase the item. More than once have I accidentally bought something I didn't mean to buy."
"11938",1080980064,"Terrible game very boring and hit box is incredibly giant"
"11939",1080980064,"Overall, this is a really fun and difficult game. I love every level design and how you need to maneuver around obstacles. One thing is, I was playing and a bug happened. It caused me to go into the background and float past everything. Unlocking the ending and finishing the game... By accident. So maybe fix this bug."
"11940",1080980064,"Just get it."
"11941",1081079080,"I bought this for my daughter. Decided to unlock the second part as well, but it won’t unlock. It shows I purchased it but it still won’t unlock. I have tried restoring purchases, restarting the iPad and the app, and even deleting and reinstalling. Still no luck. It was only $2 but it’s the principle. I paid money for something and did not receive the product."
"11942",1081079080,"Title is air & SEA, but you have to make an additional purchase to get the sea version. My 5 yr old played for 1 hour and asked what else it does. Nothing. Each character does the exact same thing, over, and over, and over, up, down, left, right.........Don’t waste your money."
"11943",1081079080,"Beware the entry at the top that says in app purchase for sea patrol. I don’t recall seeing it when I bought this - this is only to buy the Air patrol part of the game. You have to pay more to get the sea patrol game."

"11945",1081132110,"I first got the game as a little but of fun, but then after a few games I could stop playing. I have no issues with ads and it's a good game."
"11946",1081132110,"Pretty good 👍"
"11947",1081132864,"The game is great other than the ads like right when I start going an add pops up and messes me up then it freezes and I die so know one needs to see the adds they can see them,them self. No need to advise them even more they don’t do anything except bother people so get rid of them"
"11948",1081132864,"This game is so frustrating and the egg falls out way to easily, to wear if it does fall over you can’t hit the gas, to proceed playing the game, it gets very nerve racking and theirs no brake so no way to slow down! I get others  may like the challenge but not a very good game if you have zero patience!"
"11949",1081132864,"This game is fun and all, but while you are in the middle of a game, an ad pops up. The first time in happens it’s not that bad but after it happens lots, it starts to get really frustrating. Also, there is only one way to earn coins."
"11950",1081221532,"I love it"
"11951",1081221532,"I like this game"
"11952",1081221532,"Cool"
"11953",1081404850,"The car does not painted Like in the pics it just stays gray (FIX THIS RIGHT NOW!)"

"11955",1081404850,"The goat"
"11956",1081431390,"I love the series, and I was really excited to use this game, but the screen on my phone cut off some of the buttons and words on the screen and also made it hard to play some of the puzzles. I have an iPhone XR so I’m not sure how to fix this. I went to settings but there was no way to adjust the screen. Other than that, a great game!"
"11957",1081431390,"Rated 4 stars because my screen is too small for the game. I can’t see everything I need to see and I cannot complete things that need to be completed because the screen isn’t big enough. I have the iPhone XR."
"11958",1081431390,"Love it on the iPad, but on the iPhone it is not so great as it doesn’t fit the scenes to the screen. So you miss items and have a hard time seeing them in certain spots.  The game is great though. I am addicted."
"11959",1081593943,"Good story, I liked the historical setting. Nice long gameplay. Unique and fun."
"11960",1081593943,"Thank you BF, for the fixing the bug in this game although there were many more things that needed fixing. 🕷.  Even though the graphics were great and HO's were good , the hint was useless most of the time as well as the map.  I was in advanced mode so these things should have worked. I hope  it was better for you!  🍀☘"
"11961",1081593943,"I enjoyed this game so much I'm going back to play it for a second time right away. Usually I wait several months before I do that. It has many varied landscapes and characters, as well as puzzles. One thing to look out for is that a few of the Hidden Object scenes need you to leave them and come back to them. You find all the objects on the list and then are left with an item that needs something from outside the scene to finish it.  The ""turn back time"" function is unique as far as my experience goes."
"11962",1081609724,"I love this game and it is considered educational with my parents"
"11963",1081609724,"Congrats!!"
"11964",1081609724,"Loved it before"
"11965",1081612551,"Big Fish is greedy, interruptions demanding a review are ridiculous for a PAID game"
"11966",1081612551,"Should have read the other reviews on this game freezing because it happened.😡 Shame on Big Fish for not fixing this! I'll be reading the reviews more often from now on. Which means less $ for Big Fish. And I buy tons of them....or used too."
"11967",1081612551,"Look I would really like to love this game but it keeps freezing and now I'm stuck in fear of birds!!! Fix please"
"11968",1081832850,"Eh it's a reaction thing. I prefer Zap Bear."
"11969",1081832850,"LLIKE A GLLLLOVE!!!!!"
"11970",1081832850,"Tried to remove the ads by in-game purchase, but the button doesn’t do anything."
"11971",1081847121,"This is a beautiful toy. I love the interaction of the ball and the ink. For that I give it 4 stars.  However...  The puzzles aren’t hard enough, I was able to randomly pick out a few from every pack and complete them. None of the mechanics added to later tables presented a significant challenge.  The pinball doesn’t really exist. There is no table which allows for sustained play. The ink panels are one shots. Once triggered they don’t reset. There is no score, and there are no sequences or complex interactions. In addition the paddles are not reliable. Perhaps the touch region is too small, or accidental touch rejection isn’t turned off. At any rate it isn’t very important, as there isn’t much in the game to lose as a consequence.  The toy doesn’t explore the scope of play. None of the tables ‘paint’ a picture, there are no opportunities to experiment with drawing. I actually had the most fun on the title screen, using the ball to draw lines and play with the ink."
"11972",1081847121,"The idea and aesthetics are awesome. The problem is, I constantly get delayed or no response, specifically from the right flipper. This means I’m fighting the game itself and it becomes unbelievably irritating. It’s a shame; this game could’ve been great. Instead it’s all looks."
"11973",1081847121,"A beautiful game marred by laggy touch controls. Sometimes the flippers will just not activate after touching the acreen."
"11974",1081957053,"There is a possibility of becoming 'stuck' due to being locked out of scenes and having to restart. Very disappointed big fish let that happen"
"11975",1081957053,"Excellent Game!!"
"11976",1081957053,"Too easy. Predictable. Big Fish - I'm outta here."
"11977",1082069304,"Charlie is one funny guy, I'm glad he finally has his own app! Charlie fan approved!"
"11978",1082069304,"Brings out the Sheenius in ya ;)"
"11979",1082069304,"Don't believe the bad reviews. This app does exactly what it advertises itself to do. If you're a fan of Sheen, you will love this app."
"11980",1082150954,"I didn’t think anything was as good as naturespace, but this is pretty good!"
"11981",1082150954,"I used this app when I got to read in a busy break room and the winter scene is great at blocking out enough ambient noise for me to concentrate on my book. The only complaint I have is that the sounds don’t stop unless you force close the app. So after I take off my AirPods the sounds start playing on my phone’s speaker until I complete shut down the app. Other than that, great product!"
"11982",1082150954,"Very calming and relaxing scenes with beautiful graphics 7/5"
"11983",1082215066,"Short, easy, clever, fun!  Different than most escape games, plays more like a quick point and click adventure (no minigames).  Nice graphics, ads are not intrusive, and no glitches.  Would like to see more escape games from this dev..thank you!"

"11987",1082309664,"I paid for unlimited mods and I still have 6 mods and  lucky blocks and lucky balls mod does not met the standards for a mod (suggestion:1 get really new mods)!(2 make sure you check 2 times to make sure you properly have the standards for the mod)!(3 get at least 15 to 20 mods on pocket addition.That is all.   :)"
"11988",1082309664,"Booooo"
"11989",1082594539,"One of the better mystery games that I’ve played. It was challenging with good graphics. The link to the video hints was very helpful. Really enjoyed this one!"
"11990",1082594539,"It was a lot of fun"
"11991",1082594539,"Interesting game"
"11992",1082781138,"Very entertaining, but controls could use some tweaking. Notably, when the screen senses a slight movement in your finger, such as rolling the pad of your finger across it (kind of like what you would do for a fingerprint, but to a far lesser degree), it changes the direction of the sub. This is probably too sensitive.  Also, occasionally after losing a round, the green replay (arrow) button no longer works, forcing you to kill the app and restart if you want to play again.  Follow-on edit: where are the power ups? Would add a layer to the gameplay to encourage repeat. There's a sub that gives 2x coins available as an IAP but I've easily earned enough coins to buy the other subs already so there's currently no reason for me to buy it."
"11993",1082781138,"Great idea but poor controls"
"11994",1082781138,"Difficult to move around"
"11995",1082793702,"This is one of my Favorite games on my Phone. The simplicity of this game is what makes it truly addictive. Once I start playing, I feel like I never want to stop. Must-Have for ALL iPhone Users, and I can't wait to see what Gnarcade does next. Keep up the good work!"
"11996",1082793702,"Great game. Adding levels was an amazing Idea. Also, I love the new aliens"
"11997",1082793702,"i play this game often when i have some break , very easy to play but seems hard to master well. Just nice for a short break and mind you, this is addictive as you will keep playing it"
"11998",1082836132,"Would be better if state colors and beliefs per state were accurate to real life and if the majority of states you poll in wouldn’t go to your opponent"
"11999",1082836132,"Honestly, the best you can do is make me defenseless against a candidate for president... boo, just boo. Plus, the game is hard. One move and you’re out. Why can’t there be a Easy, Normal, or hard mode? Literally, this is hard. This is BULL****"
"12000",1082836132,"This game is super fun and addicting. It’s a great educational game that teaches you the basics on how to run in an election. I would recommend to anyone 5th grade and above because it is not only fun, but also very educational!  Some suggestions on what to add: -Should be able to use more values from the opposing party -Should be able to customize your character more to reflect the way you look -Should definitely have more choices when talking about a certain topic so that there isn’t just one choice that’s correct, but multiple -Should also make it when trying to discredit opponents ideas there isn’t always one correct answer that you always pick -Should be able to have more than five running goals"
"12001",1082891966,"I downloaded those for my daughter and I And was trying to see if I like it enough to purchase the full version. We tried the nap mediation, but I’m so distracted by the poor sound quality that I can’t focus on the message. It sounds like she’s on speaker phone in the bathroom... does the sound quality improve in the “paid”meditations?"
"12002",1082891966,"It’s helped a lot it’s so amazing"
"12003",1082891966,"We have been using this app for over a year with our kids. Had the free version, then upgraded to get all the meditations. It’s great for bedtime, calming, mindfulness, etc.. The kids even ask to use the meditations on their own now and will start them, curl up in bed and conk out. It’s been  really useful to teach them to be still at bedtime and follow simple directions. Best few bucks we’ve spent on a kids’ app!"
"12004",1082965369,"Would be a lot better if I could skip the intro video when I try to play."
"12005",1082965369,"My only issue with the game is that the intro cutscene is unskipable"
"12006",1082965369,"I personally like the first on and this second one has a lot of potential so love it"
"12007",1082986584,"It’s pretty good use it"
"12008",1082986584,"I spent too much on this I can’t get no mods no nothing"
"12009",1082986584,"Ok,so I put some of the packs on and they never worked on the pocket edition like everyone says it does.Minecraft on my phone is up to date in all,but the mods aren’t actually working for me."
"12010",1083057569,"It won’t let me save my interests, I click save and when I go back it’s just blank won’t let me save anything in interests can someone help?"
"12011",1083057569,"i also experience the glitch with the catagory just exit out and log in it should work  when i first got this app, it was pretty awesome. you can download several people’s snapcodes in seconds. the issue is that i keep getting an error notice. at forst this only happened a few times, but now its every other time i try to download. it says something like “this data could not be read as its not in the correct format”. again, this comes up as a pop up and is really annoying, especially when adding fast. if that went away, this app would be 5 stars."
"12012",1083057569,"Good app"
"12013",1083107235,"I actually love this. I don’t have time for MMORPG stuff... I tried getting into some, but to be honest, I’m usually just messing around on my phone during a smoke break at work, so Just a few minutes, and, “bam,” I’m done, so it’s nice to have a game I can pick up any time and drop any time without worrying about what’s happening to my loot or fort or whatever while I’m working or sleeping. And as a long time Evil Dead fan, I couldn’t resist downloading and trying it. It’s a fun little time waster, and I’ll be honest, I felt pretty Boss when I unlocked the “boomstick.”  You could do Worse. Trust me."
"12014",1083107235,"I love this game and it doesn’t require you to buy anything."
"12015",1083107235,"Good game"

"12017",1083174287,"I paid for the full version and the app never restores itself despite all troubleshooting. Going to try to get my money back"
"12018",1083174287,"I am 10 years old and it is the best app ever"
"12019",1083229791,"I love this game! Being able to have cats and not have to own them is wonderful! It’s prefect and friendly for kids! I think KleptoCats Have done a wonderful job at developing the game!"
"12020",1083229791,"sooo kawaii and a great time killer. sometimes gives me a reason to wake up."
"12021",1083229791,"It’s like the best game I’ve played today (it’s the first one too) I just got it and I’m attached :)"

"12023",1083356839,"All of their games are fun and work well! They are all a little different from each other."
"12024",1083356839,"I’m in the high 600’s and there’s just NO WAY to pass a level. 50+ times to pass a level, is outrageous. Try Monster Busters Hexa Blast or the original Monster Busters, THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER! The creator of this one must be an absolute MORON! He put the “wolf whistle” on there as a penalty when you lose a life. He should know better. That a slur to women everywhere and disgusting, not to mention sexist. I’m thinking LAWSUIT"
"12025",1083362092,"If you are a fan of true puzzle point-and-click adventure games (ala Monkey's Island, Full throttle, Grim Fandango, etc.) then this is the perfect game for you. The imagery is beautiful, and story line is fun. Yes, it's a little clunky and the voices aren't always the most animated, but this is a point-and-click game, not Call of Duty (which I also play- there is a time and place for it all). Many reviews are overly harsh about the speed and feel of the game, but they miss the fact that it's about the puzzles, story, and graphics. A definite must!!! I hope they make a sequel!"
"12026",1083362092,"great artwork and a fun story with amusing characters -- instant classic if you ask me! wish there were more like it, or maybe a sequel"

Why does a person with 15 def get 1-shot while a person with 13 def takes 1/4 the damage?   But the cardinal sin is that the game has a boring and disjointed story. It reminds me of Chinese movies that recount some popular or historical tale, and you're expected to already know what happens so they can jump around and just hit the highlights.  Just say no. I bought this while on vacation for something to play while in line or on the bus. I won't even be using it for that. $18 down the drain."
"12041",1083835330,"I will always have some bias towards Romancing Saga games because of the godly soundtrack by Kenji Ito.   Having played RS1 and RS3, the controls felt familiar; the enemies no longer rush directly towards and trap the player when they enter a map like in the first game (as often), yet the graphics, battle system, and story feel weak compared to RS3. The graphics look cleaner than the original version, and there are now animated boss sprites.   My biggest complaint would be how you control the movement of the main character and overall UI. It's unclear where you should tap when using an item/ sometimes I would press to the side and accidentally consume an item or make a wrong choice. The translations are also... kind of funky. ""Seeling skill?"" Sealing a skill? What? (Turns out I have to be careful not to tap the skill in the menu twice because that apparently DELETES it?)   Lastly, it's also irritating how you still cannot restore LP at the inn like in RS3, and you essentially have to kill off a character's LP to remove them from your party.   -- TL;DR -- Amazing music, interesting story (but a rather poor execution of it), ugly controls and UI, challenging gameplay."
"12042",1083835330,"Saga was one of my favorite series as a kid so I may be a bit biased but I think this remake is really good.    What makes Saga great is the open world and the level of challenge.  The battle system is addictive unique in a lot of ways.    Save often as you can occasionally get into situations where you can't get out of a dungeon or scenario and may not be capable of beating the boss.  Always keep a few different saves going in case you box yourself in.    The game may seem rudimentary and from a story perspective it is fairly simple but the mechanics, challenge and replay value are all really good.  Don't give up after an hour or two.  Play for at least 4-5 hours and I think you will be a fan !"
"12043",1084084901,"The game is fun but you have to turn off the music everytime you open the app and it's so annoying! And most of the ads are 30 seconds long, which isn't normal."
"12044",1084084901,"It's great! I lose a few times and just when I've had enough it goes in 😀"
"12045",1084084901,"Simple and clean design, no time limit, and non-invasive sound/music makes this game a great de-stresser, but it is also challenging enough to keep me playing"
"12046",1084133300,"Do not get this app, you will waste your money, it doesn't work, and when you actually get notifications it just covers up the other one and looks super weird so just don't get the stupid app."
"12047",1084133300,"Great product. So much better than the other ones. I love this.♥️😍♥️😍"
"12048",1084133300,"The date and time is off so it doesn't trick anyone. Once you create the photo shot the date is off by months. Please fix"
"12049",1084144010,"I am so offended right now because you deleted most of these characters and put them In different games I gave you a one star because you deleted my favorite game. Please add them back. Especially the long blonde hair girl"
"12050",1084144010,"My my town school game is glitching a lot now I have clones clones of all the characters please fix thanks you"
"12051",1084144010,"Good app"
"12052",1084153783,"I,m sorry but I can not make it to the black hole"
"12053",1084153783,"The game has good idea, but this isnt relaxing, rather frustrating ... The game is also really bad made, and the gameplay is horrible. For 3$, I'd say no..."
"12054",1084153783,"This was a pretty cool concept using black holes but you could of done so much more except for using brakes. I won't my money back worthless game. Very disappointing"
"12055",1084197093,"One of my favorite iOS synths. Being able to import third party sounds, along with the included great sounds, really sets this apart from other iOS offerings. The best part of this synth, however, is how responsiveness of the developer! Bugs are squashed very quickly with timely updates. Must buy!"
"12056",1084197093,"With a powerful arpeggiator. Thank you for AUv3!"
"12057",1084197093,"This is one of my most favorite iPad synths. When I saw Laplace get AU3 support, I was hopeful Mersenne would as well. Now that time's here and I just MIDI sequenced a quick track with it in GarageBand. The AU layout is good and scrolls smoothly to see everything. All of the effects parameters are exposed, too. I personally prefer AU to IAA or AudioBus. And I love Mersenne, so today's a great day. Thanks, IceGear!"
"12058",1084252650,"I love this game!  It stimulates my brain and expands my vocabulary."
"12059",1084252650,"This is a relaxing game. I play it often."
"12060",1084252650,"This game is just challenging enough to keep it interesting, and I have little doubt that it's a game that keeps my brain strong."
"12061",1084331400,"I use Folioscope alot to draw my series Stickman Seccion I get lots of views on those videos. So I basically love this app and I am wondering if you can make a version for website and android? I will be very happy! From- Lombbm The Gamer"
"12062",1084331400,"Reminds me of flipnote! I wish there was a feature where you can put in audio."

"12066",1084407935,"The control style of shooting the undead is unlike anything I’ve ever seen in any other game. I LOVE THIS game for its unique shades of black, gray, and white, adding to the location(s) for the rise of the undead. The music score is also great for its grim and ominous tone through out the game. I hope the developers add more content (perhaps a expansion pack or something to add to the story and more) but for what is already present in the game, great job developers 👍"
"12067",1084565679,"This game has been fun for me to play for a long time now, but it seems not to be comparable with iOS 11 which is so sad! ;-; I know that this is a new issue that needs time to work in but I hope they get on it soon!"
"12068",1084565679,"I love the art for this game and it is frustrating but addicting at the same time. I think it is totally worth it."
"12069",1084565679,"Fun"
"12070",1084600612,"Mind bending but absolutely addictive. Just wish there were more levels or versions. I finished this and the trick or treat version."
"12071",1084600612,"Having lots of fun with this. Many new concepts. Builds slowly in complexity so that you don't feel frustrated. Highly recommended!"
"12072",1084600612,"This game is elegant and easy to learn, but fiendishly difficult."
"12073",1084644256,"I can’t even go to seconds with out the game pausing and it’s annoying because I can’t pass any of the games"
"12074",1084644256,"I love this game it is so awesome and fun!"

"12079",1084805156,"It’s a good game but it needs an update for iPhone XS."
"12080",1084805156,"I have been playing every day for 2 months and there are cards required to upgrade characters that are not available in dungeons."

"12085",1084860489,"I first played this game about 2-3 years ago, and had a lot of fun. The only problem was that my iPhone 4 (what I had at the time) couldn’t delete apps, so when I downloaded this game, that fault caused so much lag I couldn’t play the game without my phone getting both very hot and very prone to crashing apps when I opened them. However, I was able to play up to the 9th-ish level before lag forced me to stop. All in all, one of the best games of this type I’ve played. Just make sure your phone can handle it first."

"12088",1084930110,"Get rid of timer. Horrible. Allow level continue option so you don't have to start over.  Run ads to continue a level. Or, we can pay to remove ads.  Then you get a 5 star rating. Without these features, there's no reason to play."
"12089",1084930110,"Please allow the game to be untimed as an option, and let players go back to the last successful level when they lose the game so they don't have to start from the beginning."
"12090",1084930110,"Game could be good, but it should have a no-timer option. As it is, it's impossible to learn how the game works, and how to interpret the numbers, once you get beyond level 10 or 11. Unless that's the point, that the player really isn't supposed to advance beyond those few levels. In which case this game is really unfulfilling."
"12091",1084930849,"Every minute on this game MZ makes money from your wifi account how do I know this I work in IT ok secondly in twelve months prices of packs have risen for Australian players from 90 to 150 dollars a pack wow which cost MZ zero dollars to produce you cant even select what you want in pack big no no thirdly get your act together if a sh 14 is attacked by a multi billion player give some fairplay and even the attack for the smaller growing player lost me money hungry idiots cya"

"12099",1085096375,"Most Cardboard games tend to be mini games with one time only replay value, but this is a legitimately fun game with good mechanics and professional polish. Happy to pay for the full game. It did crash on me but giving the benefit of the doubt that that will get fixed."

"12106",1085131523,"It’s starting to be ridiculous that the timing of everything just takes days. I really hate how you can’t prioritize your programs. For an example, my programs would attack and won’t attack ones that will benefit the most."
"12107",1085131523,"It’s good to play"
"12108",1085131523,"This a pretty impressive game, especially the graphics and creativity with visuals. I noticed the last update was a fairly long time ago, and so I hope that the game is still being improved. Great game!"
"12109",1085272239,"Get the game. Just. Get. It."
"12110",1085272239,"I love the state of the game right now but it could be even better if we support the developers they are already making free content updates and it’s nice so I think you should get the game and it would also help the developers"
"12111",1085272239,"I wish I could get my money back. Deleted."

"12119",1085432257,"Ok you think that when you jump over the cones you don’t hit it right. But really like when I play it he hits it.Also separate the cones because he needs more room to run he is not a good jumper. So that’s why I’m rating it 2 stars"

"12121",1085464876,"I guess this might be me, I have played The Room, which makes this look like crap, but this is a joke. Makes no sense in the clues, no directs the player to find out. Small and stupid."

Can you fix these puzzles to include the subtitles for the deaf?   Again, the game is excellent!"

"12129",1085652055,"False advertising"
"12130",1085660579,"The best thing about this app is that it teaches you about nature and your north to the south to the east to the west skills"
"12131",1085660579,"This is AWSOME I love it"
"12132",1085660579,"Our family loves these Grandma and Grandpa games, they are all very well done, and the right mix of entertainment with education. This new one is also very good and fits in with the rest of the series. Only complaint is it gets a little repetitive faster than some of the others but the word-find is excellent because of how it highlights each word after it is found. Really fun, and just in time for summer!"
"12133",1085697317,"I use this App daily to make tracks and songs. Easily transfers to Ableton 10 and the samples sound great. But the ease of use and simplicity is its greatest feature. The added features like chopping samples, EQ and importing are also worth the cost especially if you are using a tablet. Love it!"
"12134",1085697317,"As long as u got the basic sounds by default, sections, and u can export project files into your main DAW, I’ll give it 5 stars all day."

"12136",1085698206,"My 6-year old son and I love playing this together. But once we finished, we couldn’t help wishing for more levels to keep going. On a side note, a couple of the ads don’t seem so kid-friendly."
"12137",1085698206,"Why do you need to watch and add to get a costume. And why is this game Idk tedious. All the creators want is money which so don’t buy the costumes just test your luck plz. And I like if you don’t stop snail bob it begs you to."
"12138",1085698206,"When i click on hints i have to see an ad, when i want to unlock clothes i have to see an ad, and sometimes i get heart instead of clothes, but i already literally have unlimited hearts because i already paid for the app! What a waste."

"12140",1085730259,"This is an alright game but really? Putting up ads saying that Miley will give you a shirt or Kayne yeezy's that's low. For all the people that see this on Twitter it's fake don't waste your time."
"12141",1085730259,"I'm goin for 500 or higher✊🏽🔥"
"12142",1085768995,"I LOVE THIS GAME! I first watched my favorite Youtuber play it (#MARKIPLIER) and it looked really cool! So I downloaded it and it worked VERY SMOOTHLY, so I’m kind of confused as to why everyone is complaining! It’s amazing! My only complaint is there needs to be 10,000,000 more chapters!!!!!!!!"
"12143",1085768995,"I see I’m late to this game, but I absolutely LOVE it!!!!! Just finished Chapter 5 today and I’m so sad that the creators don’t have more games to offer. I hope that changes soon."
"12144",1085768995,"I only gave this game 4 stars because it is to bloody for kids! But I do love this game!But I am a kid!"
"12145",1085821901,"Simultaneously realizing that I really enjoy using this app, but the in-app messaging and purchases don’t do a whole lot, and refer to problems that are a year old. Admittedly this is my fault, but still bummed. Seemed like this could have had potential."
"12146",1085821901,"So I use this app for school and it's cool but you have to pay a dollar for the app that's fine but to unlock the rest of the features you have to spend an extra 2 dollars why not just give everything like honestly it's a note taking app and then you have to buy it for the whole organization part of it in my opinion just make the whole app just a dollar for everything"
"12147",1085821901,"Does not work with the iWatch!  Waste of time."
"12148",1085829348,"Very disappointed in this game. It just ends abruptly. Was expecting a lot more based on previous Poe games. This one was way too short with an ending that just came out of nowhere and didn't explain why the murderer committed the murders. The map is useless as it doesn't allow for automatic transport. Oh, and add to that the huge glitch in the bonus game HOP where I can't pick up the prosthetic leg. All in all this game is a big fail! I want my money back!"
"12149",1085829348,"I am stuck in a HOP in the bonus game, in the morgue. I cannot retrieve the final item. When I push Hint in the HOP, I get an arrow indicating to go back. When I go back and push Hint, it highlights the HOP area. And I just cannot get that last item even though it is huge and right in the middle of the screen. Am I missing something, or is it a glitch?"
"12150",1085829348,"The graphic violence at the beginning was completely unnecessary in a game like this, and seeing blood splatter on the woman's face every time I opened it became an annoyance. The art was good but the games weren't smooth at all and would jump at certain points to the extent I couldn't figure out what I did to solve them; I couldn't understand what some of them even wanted me to do. Many were a fail in my book. Hidden Object were mostly enjoyable and required more than just clicking on the items, and there was variety. However, a transporting map is a must, and this one didn't have it. I wouldn't play it again."
"12151",1085899628,"I'm stuck at the tug boat. It literally won't let me send the boat off.  I restarted my iPad n still stuck there. Might have to delete the game"
"12152",1085899628,"This game is so much fun. I love it so much."
"12153",1085899628,"Game is great, very addictive! However can’t get passed building a marine park. Whatever I click, the game automatic freezes and won’t let me exit out so I can visit my island. Very disappointing, will have to delete if not adjusted."
"12154",1085908608,"Phenomenal game."
"12155",1085908608,"Its very good, great job sir"
"12156",1085908608,"Beautiful story so creative and dark, twisty.  The puzzles are easy to very difficult and the hints are perfect. Executed wonderfully and delightfully creeptastic.   Loved this game.  If you wrote a book, I’d read it."
"12157",1085978097,"It’s sad to say since I use this app on a daily basis but Pythonista appears to no longer be in development the last update being in early 2018. Would very much love to see the developer ship an update as there really is no other app like it on iOS."
"12158",1085978097,"I wasted my money on this Pythonista. It has some Mickey Mouse Way to plot but cannot do pandas or matplotlib. Well guess what. For less money I bought the Pyto app which can do pandas and matplotlib just as it is in python 3."
"12159",1085978097,"It’s incredible to be able to program on the go with a phone. I am new to programming in general so this is an excellent tool for me to compile up the code that I know into a program just to refresh my thoughts. The app features nice customization options for the theme, which somehow enhances my workflow just a bit. I have everything good to say about this app."
"12160",1086101495,"Why can i not get the “real” Zedge on iphone? The android version is far better. I can only blame myself for making the switch."
"12161",1086101495,"Buenardoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!"
"12162",1086101495,"I used to use this app all the time. But I noticed that the pictures on would never be updated and were the same for a period of time. Now that there is new ones added recently you have to have credits how stupid can this app get"
"12163",1086126576,"It keeps bringing me to ads and the only way out of the ad is to shut it down. I then have to open it three times to get it to the puzzle. Very frustrating!"
"12164",1086126576,"I have download a package and it is just a red field or background. I like the puzzles very much. I wish you could put a zoom on the puzzles, for it would be easier to see what you are doing. Is there anything that my be done? If we can fix the issue with the red background at least then I will consider giving a five stare rate if. Thank You."
"12165",1086126576,"App constantly freezes especially for the Daily Puzzle. Haven’t seen an update in weeks. Very unstable. Shame because the app otherwise is good."
"12166",1086252028,"SECOND UPDATE: still haven't heard from ketchapp. still issues.   UPDATE: I thought making a purchase (all purchases remove ads) would help. WRONG!!! I WAS CHARGED AND I THEY DIDN'T REMOVE THE ADS!!!! THE MONEY IS GONE BUT NOT THAT. I really really like this game. only problem is I can't play on my iPad. the app crashes. I have NEVER played on my iPad. open the app, loads and crashes.  but it's so much fun on my phone. ive given this game some hours. quick enough games to be entertaining while you wait in the drive thru or something but also entertaining enough to hold your attention for a while like at an appointment.  I'm enjoying it, it's just ANNOYING that I can't play across my devices. like if it's not functional on that device, why support it?"
"12167",1086252028,"I used to play this game on my iPad and it was SUPER fun and addictive... but now I have a phone and every time I go to get on the app it immediately shuts down and closes out the app. I JUST WANT TO PLAY PEOPLE"
"12168",1086252028,"Every time i would open the app to play, it would glitch out and go to my home screen, i only got to play a few rounds, and few i could finish before the game glitching and sending me out of the app"
"12169",1086378532,"Cool game and fun to play but I purchased the option of unlocking all levels to only find out that there are not any more levels, so I would like a refund back please."
"12170",1086378532,"Not worth the time to play, it won’t let you play online"
"12171",1086378532,"Love you  ;)"
"12172",1086502786,"So I payed for it and it doesn’t let me download it waste of my money .!!!!!!"
"12173",1086502786,"There is no difference between the free and $2.99 version"
"12174",1086502786,"I did the free goosebumbs and beat all the levels and wanted more so I payed 2.99 and it doesn't seem to go any further than the free one,my advise is not to pay for it.I Am very disappointed ,I love the game so much fun,I'm going to give it 3 stars only because I want more"
"12175",1086617993,"This is exactly what I was looking for! I downloaded the lite version and then immediately purchased the full version.. I've tried many different methods to log my day such as Excel, Google docs, iOS shortcuts etc but this app takes the cake! I live that there isn't automatic backup to iCloud.  EXCEPT.. There are quite a few analytics that this application uses.. remove or give your paying customers the chance to opt out!"
"12176",1086617993,"Just need apple calendar integration to be fully complete to my usual workflow"
"12177",1086617993,"I’ve tried so many time tracking apps to try to manage my time and optimize it, but it’s either project/client based or really hard to edit. This is the first one meets all my needs, fantastic!"
"12178",1086625206,"This game does agitate me, but I love it because it helps me out with my hand and eye coordination and to have better timing when doing things.I also found out if you go to the settings of ball escape and click the question mark, it will give you a tutorial where you can get free gems. Also, in the tutorial you can die and it will let you continue without using gems numerous times."
"12179",1086625206,"All in all its a cool/fun game. Tons of advertising. But I got to 100 and beat it (without having to buy anything)"
"12180",1086625206,"The game itself is fun enough I suppose. And I understand the ads for a free game generate revenue. But why would you have gamers run out of balls? You want us to play the game so we will watch the ads to bring revenue, but you didn't consider that if we run out of balls, we might just not play the game, or even delete it (as I did)."
"12181",1086644209,"Surprised it’s not in the arcades!"
"12182",1086644209,"Fun enough, but it consistently takes 30 seconds to load up to the start screen. Makes me wonder what it's doing in the meantime."
"12183",1086644209,"I like this game a lot. It's very addictive and I keep coming back to it. However, the scoring is inconsistent. Sometimes killing something gives tons of points, and other times it gives almost none. A tutorial would be nice"
"12184",1086647459,"Why doesn’t my “contact us” button work? I get a failed to deliver message EVERY TIME I ATTEMPT IT, AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES NOW? So typical of this game. So many bugs in this game! Why doesn’t my VIP fuel actually add to my total when I touch the accept button? Please fix these issues if you EVER want a better rating from me."
"12185",1086647459,"I love this game it needs a little update But its really good"
"12186",1086647459,"This game real good. He’s like a neighbor. Helped me with my math test, cured my hamsters std, and helped me find my sexuality all within the span of 5 seconds"
"12187",1086794447,"I love this game. I just downloaded ir and cant stop playing!! So fun"
"12188",1086794447,"Why is people is saying this give's you a bug ? I just starting playing today I've read ya comments but idk if it's true about the bugs.."

"12190",1086795798,"Wasted 3 bucks on a game that will not even open up"
"12191",1086795798,"I start off trying to survive. I run down the highway destroying trucks and little maurauders with no accessories and I barely get any damage. As soon as I add protection to my vehicle I die right away. I'm doing less than I was without armor. And on top of that, the repair boys don't even repair! I think you need to update the ratings on the accessories or check for bugs... Not happy"
"12192",1086795798,"As fun as a barrel of monkeys."
"12193",1086799932,"Great game. I hope will be sequel?"
"12194",1086799932,"Great game. Love the puzzles, characters, awesome graphics, good dialogue. Bonus game goes along with theme of storyline always a plus. Hope to play more like this game in the future."
"12195",1086799932,"I am having problems getting back into the game! Finished first level and bonus challenge. I loved the hidden and the puzzles parts. Just need to be able to get to the next level easily."
"12196",1086859120,"When I finished what I think was the tutorial I was reset back to square one, with the first thing I did, If I am doing something wrong please tell me but still tell me what I am doing wrong"
"12197",1086859120,"Fun and great time passer"
"12198",1086859120,"That’s was awesome Lux 😁😉"
"12199",1086929344,"The app is good but it takes forever to earn gems and everything costs so much. I seem to be in a group where I don’t belong. I have trouble even getting a million fans and everyone else seems to get more than a million when they dance"
"12200",1086929344,"I only rated the game 2 stars because alot has changed in the game since playing in 2017 everything costs to much diamonds just to upgrade your character you can only watch like 3 videos before says you got to use your diamonds to energy refill I understand the developers need to get paid for there app game but it all just seems so unfair that you can’t really do that much just to get diamonds yes you can click on free ones but not everything on that list is free so I think that’s misleading to app users I love the show and the the game it seems like it’s really not like it used to be the dresses used to be more detailed etc I wish you could make it more easier to earn diamonds and videos to help and making things more detailed like before would be great to it’s 2019 I hope the app gets better"
"12201",1086929344,"Game is messing up and I can’t interact with it at all. Needs an update!"
"12202",1086964574,"Really cool game"
"12203",1086964574,"This game is amazing. As a teenage girl I often find life difficult and Radish girl is a sweet haven where I can relax and be myself. This game is addictive. It has a simplistic style and twist on every radish that make me smile. Even while sitting alone in a crowded blowing alley, I feel inspired by the teenage girl climbing a radish. This company’s games are all extremely unique and fun, and although can be wacky, you can tell a lot of effort was put into them. There’s games have beautiful little details that make you smile and have brought some joy into my life. Thank you RadishGirl. Really good game so recommend."
"12204",1086964574,"This game cured my cats cancer and inspired me to pursue a career in art"
"12205",1086978383,"This game is a real piece of crap graphics bad the game itself is stupid I don’t know y y’all bother making this place they have the toys they can play with those so long story short THIS IS THE MOST STUPIDEST GAME I’VE EVER PLAYED ITS A PIECE OF CRAP SO YEAH THIS GAME IS WORTH NOTHING"
"12206",1086978383,"You should add 4 save files,it would work out well for people who share one IPad,cause right now,they have to share a single save data amount on a single IPad or Iphone,I mean,come on,most of your other games have save files,so this one should have save files Update:Game still good,please add an adventure mode,if that’s added,I would love it,it could be when a crime spree appears around the world and you have to stop it,and even a create your own chase thing,like in the old version before this!That would be awesome,I miss playing around with that!These new features would be great"
"12207",1086978383,"😁😄😃 so fun existing i don’t what to stop"
"12208",1087075743,"I’ve downloaded this game before and things were great; the artwork, the thinkings, everything was great except for 1 thing:  the game is missing level 8. I have a thing where (at least) everything has to be in order (like 1,2,&3) so without that level 8 I can’t go from level 7 to level 9! So I uninstalled it. I appreciate the game, but looks like I wouldn’t download it again if that pesky level 8 doesn’t get added..."
"12209",1087075743,"I’m truly in awe of how fun and satisfying this game is. This is art.  The love the creators put into this game is so obvious. Even the soundtrack is perfect, I actually enjoy taking my phone off silent to play this game, that’s really difficult to accomplish. Seriously it’s amazing, I wish I could meet the creators to thank them."
"12210",1087075743,"Wow! This is a fantastic game and I'm really surprised the first 10 levels are free. Because of their difficulty, it'll still take a little bit to go through them. I'm hesitant to spend any money on this game though because it's not optimized for newer phones, and i don't want to waste money on something that will never receive updates. Will there be a new version of snakebird in the future that's harder than primer?"
"12211",1087125014,"This game has an interesting story. You have an idea where you need to go, but are not sure why you are there. Keeps you guessing."
"12212",1087125014,"Have played quite a few games like this and don't too often provide ratings but I really enjoyed this one. Hope there are more to come!"
"12213",1087125014,"This is the second new game I've played recently from Big Fish that is substantially shorter than their typical hidden object/puzzle adventure game. Unlike the other one (Mystery Tale - In Her Eyes), however, this one at least had considerably more depth. The game showcases many worlds from a wide range of historical eras by cleverly using time travel. There are collectible relics from each era, not too many and relatively easy to find.  There is a balance of HOP and puzzles, ranging from fairly simple to moderately complex; somehow the developer managed to invent new ones, which is always fabulous! Difficulty is configurable to the user, and one can choose match-3 games rather than HOP. The map readily enabled teleportation and indicated live tasks if desired. I could not find a way to easily access the journal without having to go through the map every time, which got frustrating when I had to review puzzle hints; however, this may have been my failure to understand the controls.  I really enjoyed the technology and history in this game, as well as the little surprises built-in when you click on some of the nonessential items; for example, the statue of an archer will shoot an arrow, lava will erupt from the volcano, etc.  Again, however, I can't give this five stars when I finished the entire game and bonus chapter in less than three hours. I hope these short games are not an omen of Big Fish's strategy for future offerings. There is no way I would pay $6.99 for a game this short, and even $3.99 seems like a stretch. I'd rather buy from and support individual developers and get a more robust game."
"12214",1087276648,"Please make this in english, a lot of players like I’am want to play this but we can’t read japanese.. this seems interesting though. Hope you guys can provide english as well like Ikemen Sengoku time romance"

"12220",1087286731,"Amazing performance on the iPhone X. Great face lift on the game guys! Good job! 😎👍"
"12221",1087286731,"I never write reviews but I felt compelled to write one about this app. It is arguably the best game that I have ever played. It's challenging and the graphics are really good. I would recommend wearing headphones when you play because the sound is amazing. When I score 2 stars I immediately start over thinking that I can do better. So, needless to say I'm completely addicted!"
"12222",1087286731,"Addicting strategy gameplay w beautiful scenery. 👏"
"12223",1087286874,"This game has low graphics and is just bad. If you where expecting a game then this is not for you. This isn’t even that fun. The game mechanics are buggy and feel like they are just based on luck."
"12224",1087286874,"the suffer is real"
"12225",1087286874,"Hello, I enjoy this game a lot especially showing my friends my thicc sausage. If you ever get in an argument with your friend you just have to whip out you phone open the app and show them the omega thicc corn dog that took me like 7 years to get. Anyway down to the real stuff I like it when I smack sausages because slapping sausages is the most satisfying thing in the whole world, anyway please add PVP because it gets boring slapping sausages so hard against each other. That’s my review keep slapping those sausages!.!.?:&3’sismeb"
"12226",1087287522,"I think you should get rid of the spikes. Once I played, and every block was covered except for one with spikes. I would like it more if you took that off, and let us listen to our music"
"12227",1087287522,"Seriously addicting game. Absolutely love it. But what I hate is the fact that your ads seem to pop up randomly, even after I start a new round and have about 15 bounces. Or I will click them away and they pop up again immediately. Fix that and I'll change to 5 stars :s"
"12228",1087287522,"Your taste in music and sound effects are not for me. I don't want to listen to your ads, I don't care about looking at the videos after I play, but you game shuts off my music so I just listen to nothing while I play your dumb game that doesn't even work. The gameplay is messing would rather have tilt option than pressing my screen."
"12229",1087318096,"This app is a ridiculously horrible car parking game with missions that are clueless and time limit so short making you get silver meaning less money and then watching ads , just horrible for the car parking community"
"12230",1087318096,"Invincible mode NOT WORKING after I purchased"
"12231",1087318096,"This is cool with the cars everyone should get it it's awesome!!!!!!"
"12232",1087433788,"This a great game funny to play to just a little hard at first it’s all about timing strike at the wrong moment then your ad good as dead"
"12233",1087433788,"More people need to support it. It’s very addicting and fun."
"12234",1087433788,"👍🏾"
"12235",1087489471,"I love this game. Ive played it for several years. Wonderful gameplay and visuals. My only complaint is that lately the game is starting to brake due to the developers basically abandoning the game. Current issues are: Game crashes randomly, game freezes and won’t close without device restart and it used to run perfectly on full settings, now it struggles on the lowest setting. All I hope is that this game gets updated again, more than just new device support."
"12236",1087489471,"This game an awesome action packed game  I like it because it helps teach you the controls really well and there where always new things to learn every minute which I loved One of my favorite parts are the heroes with there different cool abilities  This is one of my favorite games"
"12237",1087489471,"A few bugs here and there. A few new weapons, new enemies and some land scapes. Weekly missions just feels forgotten."
"12238",1087490734,"It is a scamming game"
"12239",1087490734,"Once you finish buying all the emojis there is no point! Also, WAY TOO MANY ADDS!!"
"12240",1087490734,"Ads but nice"
"12241",1087685392,"Sis I"
"12242",1087685392,"Have enjoyed this app for quite a while, but now the ads(which are too frequent) are more than often over riding the silent switch on my phone and come blaring through. Being discrete playing the game at times has become too indiscrete. Considering deleting."
"12243",1087685392,"Won’t move"
"12244",1087693451,"You should add recipes"
"12245",1087693451,"It needs to be 1$ not 2 but it’s fun"
"12246",1087693451,"I just loaded it and it has no sound."
"12247",1087742191,"Great app but there is an error or something.  Each time game is played it it asks us to swipe to buy.  When we do that, it does say we already paid.  Just inconvenient bc it won’t give full access without double swiping each time.  Wonderful app for the kids otherwise."
"12248",1087742191,"$2.99 is a little pricey. My two year old loved it but quickly was saying ""I already did this one."" Just wish you got more than 12 levels/games for $2.99."
"12249",1087742191,"This is a wonderful program for toddlers. However, there is a mistake. One of the activities requires sorting of vegetables, fruits and berries. The watermelon should go with regular fruits, but it will not allow the watermelon with the regular fruits. It allows the watermelon to be grouped with berries. Watermelons are not berries."
"12250",1087784913,"It's a fun great flipping dance game and the characters are really cool. 👍🏾"
"12251",1087784913,"Great game!"
"12252",1087784913,"Super fun! Swiping could be better as another reviewer said. Need more characters. Super fun!"
"12253",1087817882,"It is a fun game for littler kids but I would play this game not one of my favs😐"
"12254",1087817882,"I just got this game and it’s sooooo boring.I hate it even if I like dogs I hate this game soooooooo much.Is this game new to you coco play.But this game is fun too I just can’t buy everything.😭😭😢"
"12255",1087817882,"I like it but could be better"
"12256",1087839782,"It stop allowing me to copy and paste it to my messages"

"12263",1087984514,"this is good for winning the game but ITS A RIP OFF I don’t even have a pc wish I did though ):"
"12264",1087984514,"I Wunt the real game And I want chips lol!!!!!!"
"12265",1088041538,"Not their best, but playable."
"12266",1088041538,"Great game. Ali like it."
"12267",1088041538,"I didn't even finish it. I just wasn't compelled to. I think I am done with Big Fish games. They started off creepy enough to be fun and challenging enough to be worth the money spent. But things have gone downhill since and there's no end in sight. I can't bring myself to spend another penny on a HOG in this vein (and I have bought many). Oakville offers nothing new, has a ridiculous storyline, way too much back and forth, and yet again, objects being used in silly ways. Save your money and go buy a Telltale game instead."
"12268",1088056625,"I used to love Big Fish games, but now there are pop-up ads every time you pause the game.  I would be ok with ads if the game is free, but you pay $6.99 up front and then you still have to deal with ads.  I will not be buying any more BF games."
"12269",1088056625,"You won't be disappointed..more than the purchase price because of all of the extras..I am a big mystery / puzzle player..way back to The Room one..this game captivated me..never once got bored or frustrated..if you just want HOPs..not for you..if you want something to entertain and challenge your mind..then..BUY it!!"
"12270",1088056625,"My rating is closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up because (a) I liked the complex HOPs, (b) the developer went the extra mile with collectibles, and (c) I may be too critical because I personally found the game dull.    The plot never really crystallizes, and the ending to the main game is abrupt.  The bonus chapter is very brief, so it doesn't make up for the shortcomings of the storyline.  However, the graphics, cut scenes and soundtrack are well done, and there is a good blend between HOPs and minigames. Most of the HOPs involve multiple steps, and they are a strong positive for the game.  Also, the developer provided not only a set of collectibles, but souvenirs that you can gather from designated scenes after you have completed the bonus chapter.  The controls need some work. Difficulty is not configurable.  Touch sensitivity for items and movement is erratic.    On the whole, this was a game that I looked forward to finishing, so it's difficult to say that I recommend it.  If you can buy it on sale, you may find it worth your time."
"12271",1088115502,"Very good"
"12272",1088115502,"This app is great"
"12273",1088115502,"Easy to use and fun to see your top pics:)"
"12274",1088172195,"It's not a long game but it makes you think."
"12275",1088172195,"Have to admit I was getting frustrated with this one. Felt like stabbing something with that butterknife, but that’s what I love about these games. A challenge is good"
"12276",1088172195,"Okay, in all fairness one puzzle solution was soooo obscurely not what I was expecting that I considered four stars.  But it was a fair piece of logic, and a little clever legerdemain - my eyes were looking big picture, not small.  Gorgeous to look at, fun to play - typical Goro Goodness."
"12277",1088194226,"I’m a boy i will not play as a girl I don’t care how fun it is I won’t play as a girl And if there is a switch I can’t figure out how to do it"
"12278",1088194226,"Edit: In the absence of any developer involvement, I’ve seen multiple instances of racism and anti-semitism in the chats. Needs a reporting mechanism, and someone to do something about it.  I wouldn’t recommend starting this game now. The developers have stopped managing it and the dedicated players are leaving.  The story mode is pretty stale to begin with, and without new events or content it isn’t fun for seasoned players anymore. Also, the server crashed for 48 hours recently.  I really enjoyed this game and community. Sad to see it go."
"12279",1088194226,"The npc monsters just attack the monster with the highest attack stat on your team giving the game no diversity in the fights other then that perfect and highly recommend but please fix this it really bugs me ok please :( :("
"12280",1088242281,"Bad controls. Bad collision detection. Overall bad game. Maybe try to work on it more. Instead of free movement have 3 set paths to jump between."
"12281",1088242281,"It goes so slow"
"12282",1088242281,"This game can cause your phone to completely freeze, needing a restart.  It also has this insanely irritating glitch ware the camera on your character slips to one side or the other... Until your character is completely out of view... Until you restart the game.  This is a total trash game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"12283",1088300283,"❤️🌹❤️ this app as it's fun but not good on deals with buying chips as its expensive. Will not buy chips until it's cheaper like under $1.99. Other games offer this so just think about it & thank you for the bonus in writing a review & rating as you still get 5 (Five) stars."
"12284",1088300283,"I love this game. Hard to win."

"12287",1088496590,"love the app but hate the night mode. it is too hard to see."
"12288",1088496590,"Wow! I am blown away by the quality and usefulness of this app! Unlike other clash applications, this isn't a cheap cash grab, the developer really put time into polishing this app and I find it extremely useful in planning war attacks. Recommended for any avid war attacker! :)"
"12289",1088540036,"Game was great and can’t wait to support shakedown Hawaii! But can’t bother till this can at least get iPhone X support!"
"12290",1088540036,"I love the game but can you guys update it so that the game uses the whole screen of my IPhone X. And add some more features and building that you can enter in. Also, add some-more EasterEggs. And make it that where you can buy yourself a house and make the map more bigger and open the game more so that you can do some-more stuff. Also can you make it to where you can swim in the water, and reaching a certain point you can get eaten by a shark or a big sea monster."
"12291",1088540036,"This game won’t even run when I try to play it it just boots me out of the game so I can not play and when I try to reinstall it it doesn’t even work then I tried to get a refund but it said I can not get a refund so I wouldn’t recommend this game at all"

"12299",1088625279,"I really like it and could use some more but I never know whats gonna come in the next update. I play this game every day I just love it"
"12300",1088625279,"Lots of fun if you need to kill some time.  Mindless in need of brain power to play.  Needs something more.  There is zero strategy to play.  Needs a ""nuke"" bomb you can use say after collecting say 100-150 gates.  To help get out of tight spots."

"12302",1089048531,"I love this game, except when I finish the daily  3 things you need to finish to get free stuff, it’s free so I guess we shouldn’t expect anything great, but I used to get free gold or coins, now it is, 2 carrots, 2 onions, but again it’s free stuff, but I’m going back to my game, Thanks"
"12303",1089048531,"Love the GAME"
"12304",1089193839,"BEST GAME EVER!!but needs more characters."
"12305",1089193839,"This app is so fun I just can’t stop playing it…I just have two  things.1.If you fail twice you should be able to pay to revive. For example If I fall twice I should be able to revive for 100$ 2. Make the character look better then I can give you five stars"
"12306",1089193839,"At first I read the reviews and was wondering if I should get it so I decided to try it.It's fun and I haven't seen a single add.It's easy to. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it.So if you like the amazing world of gumball and weird snails I highly recommend!Please make more games like this.❤️❤️❤️"
"12307",1089215088,"I'm stuck in the middle of the game, but it's still fun to try and figure out the right combinations."
"12308",1089215088,"and lazy UX design make this feel like a re-skinned paid version of the free Fold.   A total lack of effort was put into reward screens and visual elements outside of blocks. Level selection is a bore. Lack of undo button makes this game even more repetitive."
"12309",1089215088,"Figured whatever, I'll give it a try. Here I am, greatly surprised, I'm loving this game 😀"

"12312",1089336971,"don’t get me wrong it’s kinda addicting but the game crashes a lot and i don’t understand why one of the vaults you open has to be opened by watching an add and usually there are no adds to watch."
"12313",1089580662,"Worthless!"
"12314",1089580662,"This is set up very nicely, but just one problem...YOU CANT ACTUALLY USE IT BECAUSE THE COMMAND IT TRIES TO USE IS TOO LONG. THIS PREVENTS YOU FROM GETTING THE THING!!!"
"12315",1089580662,NA
"12316",1089666978,"This app provides no value."
"12317",1089666978,"Don’t put it is compatible with the iPad if you are going to just have the small square on my screen. Yes I know you can enlarge it but it looks ridiculous. Very disappointed I can’t use with my iPad Pro 12.9 with keyboard. Will change rating once you make it   Fit the iPad horizontal."
"12318",1089666978,"Says it fits all screens, lies."
"12319",1089836344,"I emailed customer support twice, spoke with two representatives to have my account deleted. Even after receiving a confirmation email of my deletion, my account has remained for a month and 10 days. (I used my friend’s account to view it.)   I don’t want any affiliation with any app that uses bots as viewers. Do not believe the hype, this is not a safe app for kids."
"12320",1089836344,"C money"
"12321",1089836344,"Best app ever"

"12323",1089847385,"So hard"
"12324",1089847385,"The concept is good, but what’s the point of looking for the hidden thunder if you can’t use it??? There should be a way that the thunder can be used on specific tiles, but it seems random, and even random when you are asked if you want to use the thunder."

"12330",1090276143,"Thank you for the good game um it’s cool it has picture looks real cool game but please give me free money sponsored by pixelo"
"12331",1090292301,"It’s a fun game, but could really benefit from iCloud game saves. I don’t particularly feel like starting over to play on a new device."
"12332",1090292301,"Disappointing App in that I couldn’t find some basic instructions on what I was supposed to do.  I found it to be boring without knowing the basics.  The developer’s website contained no information at all - just screen shots."
"12333",1090292301,"An amazing game, I loved it from the very start with its relaxing gameplay and interesting hard and easy levels. I love playing this game so much, I wish I was able to get yankais peak but I don’t have money. Anyway this game is so fun and a great stress reliever. Been playing for such a long time and love it."
"12334",1090532562,"I don't know if I did something wrong but not working but I spent 5$ on worser things"
"12335",1090532562,"It can be picky sometimes,  but has already paid for itself, and has helped me find a lot of extra golf balls around the course."
"12336",1090532562,"I'm an avid golfer, about 3 times a week so i just had to give this app a try. It does not work. My eyes were better at finding where the ball was located. I even used the app and it was not even detecting the ball as it laid right infront of my feet. I was very hopeful for this app, but if you have no idea where you ball might have rested, it's not a miracle app that will magically find it for you. Save your money, follow your ball, and use your eyes to find it. A trial version would help others give it a try to help improve it."
"12337",1090552213,"This game has been broken for a year and STILL no fix."
"12338",1090552213,"Sometimes the buttons won’t work, makes me mad as well you know. Having a good run combo is high and then I can’t shoot"
"12339",1090552213,"I love this game and it has really addictive fun game to play with your friends play the game once and you will never pit it down great game I love this game play it all the time"
"12340",1090577736,"Fryta is a facking batch!"
"12341",1090577736,"This game is a lot like hydro Thunder.  Edit:  I was playing Hydro thunder on my Xbox one S and realize that both games were created by the same company. I’m glad that hydro thunder is backwards compatible."
"12342",1090577736,"I any my money back. Not any better than the free games"
"12343",1090617661,"Poop"
"12344",1090617661,"It is kinda hard to keep tapping and if you miss the bar then you don’t jump. It is still fun and easy with no internet😸😸😸😸"
"12345",1090617661,"Great way to escape church"
"12346",1090757314,"So what I like to do is set the app up to replay a scenario but if you look at the back side front leg while you shoot to when you inspect it’s in total complete spot and saying I hit from shoulder isn’t even close to replay a scenario. Should update to single pin also for an option."
"12347",1090757314,"This is a incredible game..I’m a bow hunter and this is fun to mess around with in that stand anyway you guys should add 5 10 15yrd pins and maybe different size bucks and maybe add does it would be cool if you could watch you animal die but any way 👌🏻👍🏻"
"12348",1090757314,"Would be awesome if it had better details of the internals of a turkey, change closest pin setting to 15 yards, different calls for ALL animals, and effect of the animal falling over after kill shots."
"12349",1090759947,"Not sure how this would ever be entertaining or fun."
"12350",1090759947,"Sickest game. Beautifully made and challenging when the tohtum starts moving fast. I love the song. Puts me to sleep n reminds me of my ex girlfriend. A must download for everyone!!!"

"12352",1090826925,"This update is so bad. It makes my ball go so so so so so so so so so slow and oh Em Gee it like gives me a tutorial full entire time. I'm so sorry that I have updated this game is really really bad and it stinks"
"12353",1090826925,"My kids love it!! This is the only game that they wanna play!!!😂😂"
"12354",1090826925,"Great brain game!"
"12355",1090871721,"I would love a refund i don’t understand stand how to do anything in the game the only thing I could do was plow the crops don’t know how to get more money to store the crops and just confused🤨"
"12356",1090871721,"Good game but I can’t find the selling places for my crops"
"12357",1090871721,"This was the worst game I have ever played, Can I have a refund?"
"12358",1090877424,"Pretty fun game"
"12359",1090877424,"Would rate it a 5 if he stayed at Dortmund..."
"12360",1090877424,"Not football. 🏉🏉🏉"
"12361",1090922211,"Maybe don’t charge 4 dollars for a game that gets my son excited and then doesn’t work... sincerely every parent with a 3 year old.."
"12362",1090922211,"Was this app created to charge parents only? We’ve purchased and haven’t been able to use it. The screen is black with the sounds playing."
"12363",1090922211,"Please fix. Use to work and now screen is black on IOS 10"
"12364",1091000556,"Tbh I use my moms credit card without her knowing and this app is amazing ❤️😂 shhh I didn't say anything"
"12365",1091000556,"You have to wait to do anything or pay and you have to pay 1$ to play"
"12366",1091000556,"They locked me out of the app and now my pug will die. DON’T GET ATTACHED BECAUSE THIS WILL CERTAINLY HAPPEN TO YOU. Plus you have to pay money so you can get stuff for your pug. I need birds for a new bed but I have no energy to do tricks or walks so I can’t get a new bed. And if you lose your phone for a day your pug DIES and is too sad to watch just make it run away or something.PLEASE FIX THE GAME SO MY BELOVED PUG WON’T DIE!!!  Please update your game because it hasn’t been updated since 2017 THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. I need more fixes to be done like helping me get my pug back.  My game glitched out and I restarted but it won’t let me get in Alice is going to die I stand with the many people that say FIX THIS GAME PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"12367",1091215595,"Everyone keeps saying well this bugs me that bugs me. It’s annoying. 1 this app is for kids, 2 it’s free, we’re you expecting perfection? If you want it to be all perfect go buy the real version."
"12368",1091215595,"When I downloaded this game as a six year old (I am now seven), I thought it was fun! I am now in second grade and I still think the same thing.I think it is also creative! I can’t believe I can make a WHOLE  DANCE PLAY FROM MY SCRENE! Thank you for making this wonderful app!"
"12369",1091215595,"I really like this game. It’s really fun. BUT,I get tired of having to use the same music over and over again,it gets stuck in my head too much. And the outfit options are horrible. Plus there are only three characters to choose from. When I was playing I saw an ad for the other toca dance, so I clicked on it. It was everything I didn’t have on this toca dance. I asked my mom if lcould get and she said yes. Then she found out that it was FOUR DOLLARS!! So she said no. Was really sad/mad. It is completely unnecessary for a stupid app to cost four dollars!!! I am not trying to be rude. Believe me,I’ve always loved toca apps . But this one disappointed me A LOT. I’m sorry and I hope you take my advice and change the price on this app. Thanks👎🙂"
"12370",1091366179,"Fun little time-waster, although collecting the little balls and leveling them up can be rather fun."
"12371",1091366179,"This game is fun to play when your passing time and it does get a little challenging when you have multiple balls."
"12372",1091366179,"Simple, fun, busy."
"12373",1091366799,"Too short for the price!"
"12374",1091366799,"Map is a nice element;Game flows very Nicely.Good job guys;Keep them coming🤑"
"12375",1091366799,"I will just do a short review because of all of the excellent reviews which are what motivated me to buy this game.  Long Time Game Reviewers (you know who you are), Bless your hide!  Since Big Fish very seldom allows us a short trial before we buy, all of my bankroll is placed on good reviews.  When a new game comes out, I have to twiddle my thumbs waiting for the reviews to come out.  Of course, I am certain that they come out earlier than 3 days after the game's release, but Big Fish has some mysterious reason for not releasing them sooner.  As for the DTE, Please keep giving us such wonderful reviews!  As you said, Lynx Minx, quality reviews is beginning to have a positive effect on the quality of the games being released.  Now if Big Fish would only realize they would also sell more games if they would go back to the old policy of giving their gamers a short trial before buying.  Now, back to my ""Short"" review:  Great Game, Buy It! ❣👍"
"12376",1091456207,"I love this game so much! Just waiting on an update! :D"
"12377",1091456207,"The game is addicting and great for passing downtime, but they need to add new levels"
"12378",1091456207,"It’s just to easy"

"12382",1091569546,"I just saw kubz scouts play this type of games and I was like ....I really want to try this and I got another game after another after another this is the best ❤️❤️❤️"
"12383",1091569546,"I love how you managed to ad some comedic aspects to the game, it made me love it a lot!"
"12384",1091569546,"Im not missing any but it just makes me lose, ew"
"12385",1091598017,"I’ve always been so wary to buy a game on my phone but this one is so worth it. The first few days I had it, played for hours! Trying different strategies and trying to last longer is so fun. And you don’t just see how long you can survive either - there’s a story! This game was so worth it, and I love it!"
"12386",1091598017,"I played for a couple hours and had a lot of fun. I’m playing on my IPhone X though so I haven’t had any issues with the game crashing or not working. For now the game seems to be working fairly well. The game gets a little tedious after the survivors first few days but it seems like a great game for killing time."
"12387",1091598017,"It crashes at the end of day seven"
"12388",1091620783,"That's what this game should have been called. Fruit Ninja Turtles. It's the same mechanics just with Ninja Turtles themed enemies instead of fruit. However the swiping is not as accurate and feels clumsy. Many times I've swiped only to have missed. It's not worth the money."
"12389",1091620783,"The game is ok but there is not enough levels there are only a few.This game is not worth $4 my son beat it in 30mins and is now done with it."
"12390",1091620783,"My 4 and 3 year old really love this game. 3.99 well spent I'd say"
"12391",1091640857,"Dear creators:  Thank you.  Although I stopped at some point and I don't think that I can continue this amazing journey, because of feeling real pain and suffering, but thank you.  You've created something extraordinary.  Thank you."
"12392",1091640857,"I have to say what an eye opening experience this has been. I cried the whole time basically and felt as if I lived the pain that these parents felt. And that pain I felt playing this can’t even equal the pain they went through living this. The strength y’all have is amazing and the faith you kept despite the situation. I thank y’all for this game and showing people that sometimes we can’t escape reality the way we would like to. But instead we should embrace what life has been given to us. Thank you for showing us your journey . Joel is no longer in pain and happy watching y’all from heaven."
"12393",1091640857,"This game touched my heart. I had a experience with cancer not me but my best friend..it all started when I was in pre k and she was in 2nd grade she used to give me a hug every morning then over that summer she was diagnosed with brain cancer she had treatment but on the first day of school I saw my best friend with no expression  in her face and in a wheelchair. She didn’t remember me at all I felt neglected and very depressed. During that summer she died in her sleep. I remember that first day of school I was on the bus and my friend said she died I obviously didn’t believe her because well I was in denial. When I got off that bus I went up to my teacher and whispered to her and she sadly said yes. I was crying but no one cared because they didn’t know and her brother was in my class so he got all the love and got to talk to the teacher i know I might sound selfish but it hurt because no one seemed to care that I felt bad. Over all the game was amazing full of memories."
"12394",1091684426,"This is Awsome !"
"12395",1091684426,"GREAT GAME"
"12396",1091684426,"The game need update to improvement and solve some issues please.  Thanks"
"12397",1091699305,"It is The best game of all time it is so fun and I love game shakers games."
"12398",1091699305,"The game is great but it has just few levels try to make more like in your game other games🤔"
"12399",1091699305,"Game is baging and stop working.😡"
"12400",1091700242,"When I click on the G sign to look for an address with Maps the keyboard crashes"
"12401",1091700242,"I have a Android and a iPhone this is the best keyboard ever and it stays up to date with all the new emojis"
"12402",1091700242,"The worst thing on my phone not even worth a star"
"12403",1091824117,"I got 80% on the first level and it gave me one out of three stars. I am disappointed that games are like this. 👎"
"12404",1091824117,"This game is absolute fun to play with, but the in app purchase is too expensive."
"12405",1091824117,"This app charges SO MUCH MONEY for a simple ""unlimited gameplay"" feature. I tried playing it, and lost immediately because the game has poor mechanics.   Imagine a broken game that charges you $20 for unlimited gameplay. Uh, no. Uninstalled, never downloading again."
"12406",1091944550,"Glitches too slow boring crap DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP APP"
"12407",1091944550,"This is a game we’re you play but there’s something wrong that I’m ALWAYS MAD ABOUT IT.First stop the lagging I always get mad and sometimes I delete the game.Second try to put sounds because with silent it’s creepy just put like... whatever just do it"
"12408",1091944550,"what numbers are there for the code?"
"12409",1091974564,"I’m a big Final Fantasy fan.  Was looking forward to playing this game. Downloaded it then had to download extra content. Had to wait for it to download. Go in to play the game and all it does is show a loading screen and then it shuts the app down. Yes it is compatible with my phone.  This is a big disappointment and cause of this I can only give one star and that’s cause I am forced to mark a star."
"12410",1091974564,"Crash upon loading."
"12411",1091974564,"What is the point of an app that lets you download the product but not let you play? I have solid Wi-Fi, plenty of storage, and I am plugged directly into an outlet. Every time I go to open the app it brings me to the loading screen and crashes out of the app. The gameplay looks better than most other FF mobile games, so I am quite interested in how it actually plays. I guess I’ll just stick to FFBE and DOO until somebody figures a way to stop the crashes. Or I will just replay my FF games on household consoles and remove the option of spending my money in SE apps."
"12412",1092109109,"I love it"
"12413",1092109109,"Hi I'm a kid and the game is very good but there are 2 things I don't like FRIST the toy room would be good if you make it like one of those things with the tubes and slides and the other thing is more then half of the activities are locked so please pleas pleeeeeeeeeeease unlock more of the activities. And I'm also only 9"
"12414",1092109109,"It won't load"
"12415",1092146718,"I appreciate the efforts the author is going to be inclusive but there isn't an ounce of subtlety in this story. There are about 5-6 different points in the game where your character monologues about underrepresented people and has to make a decision about what you plan to do about them. They're literally the same questions and answers slightly reworded with no effect on the story. Of all the Hero Project games I felt like I had the least control over the outcome in this one."
"12416",1092146718,"this book, along with the heroes rise trilogy, is absolutely wonderful to read. weaver is literally one of my favorite characters ever. can’t wait for the second book!"
"12417",1092146718,"This game takes a lot of liberties with the way your character thinks and how they look at the world. It is completely out of your control, you can have a bad relationship with other characters, try to be cutthroat and manipulative, yet can’t help but to be ‘inspired’ or ‘uplifted’ by them. I wanted to play the game as a bitter underrepresented separatist, who sympathized with the games antagonists... and they are options that suggest you can do that, but no matter what, through the narrative you are not that person. I wanted to play as someone who doesn’t like the idea of being idolized or deified, but again no matter what your character will feel like it is their duty to speak for other people. I didn’t feel like this when I played the first trilogy."

"12427",1092463062,"This game brings back SO many memories back in Middle School. I showed it to my best friend and he and I fell in love! This game is so addictive I love it! I love this game almost as much as you guys do and I will continually support it! Thank you  Pixel Grams Team for everything you do for this wonderful game!"
"12428",1092463062,"I've finished every single puzzle with three gold stars and do the daily challenges every day! This is my go to puzzle app to do in the morning along with my coffee. Thank you for making these! I do wish there were some more story puzzles to do! I can only go back and redo those puzzles so many times! 👍🏻"
"12429",1092463062,"I was desperate to get away from the pixel color by number games for so long until I found this game. It was a beautiful game that had an amazing soundtrack, puzzles that kept me on my toes, and a wonderful design. It’s a truly free game with no membership blocking most puzzles, all the main puzzles in story mode are accessible. It is remarkable what a small group can do with a dream and the tools to make it real."
"12430",1092463295,"I saw an ad for this game and it got my attention, so I downloaded it. The first thing that happens 20 seconds after I click on ""open"", it crashes. It just did this over and over again! I hope someday it'll work..."
"12431",1092463295,"I love this game! I played it a while back and it was amazing! 10/10 5 stars whatever! I love it so and I was a big Sonic fan a a really young kid so I like the Sonic update thank you for making a great game and I wish you luck"
"12432",1092463295,"I have been playing this game for years on, and spent so much money on it. Only down fall of this game is the crashes, it crashes more often then it should. Aside from that i would highly recommend for all the anime and weeb lovers haha :3"

"12436",1092704571,"This app is awesome and easy to use"
"12437",1092704571,"Makes purchasing so much easier, always reminds me when my favorite collections are coming out!, cannot ask for a better app"
"12438",1092704571,"Good app"
"12439",1092749144,"5 stars ✨"
"12440",1092749144,"Great update, love the new art and finally I was able to complete the game. It took some time but thanks to the creators. Would recommend 8/10"
"12441",1092749144,"Hopefully part 2 will be coming out soon as well"
"12442",1092850344,"Although there no eeve it’s not very good as an eevee lover eeve is 3rd on fav Pokémon it should be an option"
"12443",1092850344,"I love it I love it"
"12444",1092850344,"I was a BIG fan of Pokémon since I was in kindergarten!"
"12445",1092899813,"Tried several, like this one the most.  Bit frenetic, takes some getting used to, but once you do it’s fun."
"12446",1092899813,"And change the kits"
"12447",1092899813,"Gosh I used to love ads, now I hate them!  REMOVE THEM NOW OR I WILL DELETE YOUR GAME FOREVER!"
"12448",1092971411,"After playing this game only one time and getting frustrated, I just spammed my fingers on the screen and got a score of 74. I don't know if there is any way to fix this but for right now this game has some major ways around how you are actually supposed to play the game.  -Tommy"
"12449",1092971411,"Great game, except for one thing. When it gives you the boost, it drops you right back in the game and I usually end up dying because it has no warning or anything of when it's gonna stop and then I usually run into something right away. I would change it so that after the boost, there's just like 2 seconds of no obstacles before they start coming again so I can be ready"
"12450",1092971411,"They force you to wait 5 seconds and even when you can close the stupid button doesn't even work!!! Why does ketchapp need to work with that company! Please stop!"
"12451",1093108529,"The game is amazing and I love it but it always asked me would like a premium so I would like Better coding very good game though get it and color"
"12452",1093108529,"To start with, most of the pictures are unavailable to you unless you buy the premium version.  So I found a picture that was available to me and started to color.  Every couple of minutes, you were interrupted with an ad trying to get you to buy the premium version.  You can just press continue with free version and go on with your picture.  But, it started happening more and more.  Eventually, you were completely blocked from finishing your picture unless you bought the premium version.  I cannot believe they would do that!  DELETING!!!"
"12453",1093108529,"Don’t get they will charge your card over and over till you have no money"
"12454",1093131935,"This is so much better than drum pad machine or other beat making games because it is add free, has funny costumes, and you can record your music and post it for people to listen to and vote for!! Would highly recommend this game to people, so please download.  P.S. if incredibox makers read this, I recommend an alien set-thing for your next update. :)"
"12455",1093131935,"So COOL"
"12456",1093131935,"Oh my goodness! This game is awesome! It’s like for people that couldn’t afford a $300 producing app! I really wonder what you have in store in V8! It’s worth it!"
"12457",1093180069,"Very nice gameplay"
"12458",1093180069,"I enjoy all their small Civil War battle games.  Thanks for the fun battles."
"12459",1093180069,"This is my third HexWar Civil War game and it is good. Only one glitch, when I downloaded the game no icon showed up. To access it I am forced into going back through the App Store. What's up with that?"
"12460",1093190533,"Best mobile game"
"12461",1093190533,"So I downloaded this game with no hopes because I didn’t think it was good but the more sorry playing it the more I thought it was I was so wrong"
"12462",1093190533,"I love PewDiePie and his content, so after seeing his ad at the end of his video a million times, I FINALLY decided to get it, and it is very fun! I would give more stars if I could!"
"12463",1093326711,"Please optimize your app for iPhone X! Really limits the enjoyability of the game experience."
"12464",1093326711,"This game is the best game I’ve played besides fornite. it is also very funny.  I would like a update, such as making your own brick or character"
"12465",1093326711,"This game is incredibly addictive and entertaining.   As a proud Trump supporter, I find the digs at both Trump and Hillary funny political satire and it just adds to the entertainment.   If you are offended by this game in any way, you are literally what’s wrong with America."
"12466",1093360165,"I’ve loved this app for so long but it’s suddenly acting buggy. It signed me out and now says it’s offline and there are no mediations downloaded and to reconnect.  No matter what I do, I get that screen. :( Anybody else having same issue?"
"12467",1093360165,"I have tried many meditation apps and they all are very limited with their product and what users can access. Although this app also has many meditation options, a lot of them you have to pay for but even without doing that, I get a solid meditation. Definitely worth your time if you like meditating. ❤️"
"12468",1093360165,"I had to delete the app because the loud and obnoxious branded intro ruined my focus and flow going into every meditation I tried or repeated"
"12469",1093396572,"Nope"
"12470",1093396572,"Have played it over twice. Loved every second. Balanced, fun, and lots of room to customize your crew! I’ve only found a single bug in over 15 hours of playtime. 5 stars!"
"12471",1093396572,"Steam World Heist is the greatest game I ever played and the graphics are amazing. But... 🤯🤯🤯❓WHO THE HECK WAS THAT WEIRD GUY RIDING THAT BONE HORSE!!!!?? HE LOOK LIKE HE WAS Straight out of lord of the RING!!!?....💍 YOU GAME DESIGNERS Can’t END SUCH A Great game like That!!🤯🤯! You CANNOT END SUCH A Great game WITH A TOTAL CLIFFHANGER LIKE THAT! WITH A GOBLIN OR GRIBLE OR HOBO WHO Obviously EVIL 😈 😈!!!! OR WHAT ever he is.... LIKE THAT!!!😟😟😱😱 OH AND I’m not the only one who is STUNNED BY THIS.

Please I can’t take the suspense OF it much longer I NEED TO NOW WHAT THE GOBLIN IS PLANNING FOR ARE HEROES!!!! BUB!!! BUB!!! BBAA!!!!"
"12472",1093409783,"It glitches my phone"
"12473",1093409783,"The music is the best part. Graphics are amazing too, but the game is too short. Will you ever add more levels?"
"12474",1093409783,"This is really one of my favorite games to play, it is sooo addictive in a good way. It has THE BEST MUSIC EVER and when you tap it is not choppy at all, and it is sensitive enough so u don’t have to tap twice to make it move. I have completed all the levels but the last one and it has been a fun challenge. I recommend you get this game if u are looking for a game that challenges you but is also really fun. And again I have to remind you that the music is so moving that u feel as if u are the line and are on an adventure!!!!!!"
"12475",1093430283,"Love that the dev has 2 different ways to end the games. Great job."
"12476",1093430283,"There is no logic to figuring out: 1 what the puzzles are 2: how the puzzle fits into the story."
"12477",1093430283,"Glitchy and apparently doesn't auto save. Had to close it down to get out of a glitch and lost all progress. Not very appealing or imaginative over all IMO."
"12478",1093438308,"This cute keyboard of moomin stickers used to work great but now in iOS 11.4 it won’t paste into messages.  Please fix and update the app if you can because I love these stickers!"
"12479",1093438308,"Overall, the sticker pack is filled with a lovely selection of images of your favorite moomin characters. You get to see all the iconic characters as they were portrayed in the original comics as expressive as ever. However in terms of functionality I find the app a bit lacking. Most sticker apps nowadays allow for use of the IOS ‘drag & drop’ style stickers which can be arranged anywhere on your messages. This app utilizes a less customizable ‘copy & paste’ method of posting, which requires sending a whole second message in order to properly display these images. If this app were to add that copy/paste functionality I think the app would be much more successful and allow for increased usability.  TL:DR- Great pictures of your favorite characters but a poor copy/paste method of posting (rather than the drag/drop) makes the app less easy to use in ‘messages’"
"12480",1093438308,"I’m installed and added the Moomijis keyboard to my phones. When I tap on one of the stickers, it says “copied” then I try to paste it into the text area, but it only pastes the last text/image I copied, not the Moomijis sticker. Hope it’s gets fixed to work soon."
"12481",1093466319,"Pj party is Awesome 😎 you should get it you get to do really fun Activities I love it 🥰 ❤️"
"12482",1093466319,"What the heck it is fun but you can barely do anything  This game needs to have a little more detail to it."
"12483",1093466319,"Awesome game I would get it for your child"
"12484",1093488401,"Lot of times the buttons won’t even work."
"12485",1093488401,"This game is ok, but you should make a realistic game with turn signals and lights and real traffic rules and cops and speed limits....."
"12486",1093488401,"This game is bad the cars are slow it lags make a game with a 2015 Dodge Challenger hellcat with turning signals and headlights"
"12487",1093582666,"Couldn’t be happier! Amazing work"
"12488",1093582666,"I choose  Krome + for all my editing.  I do it as gifts.  You transformed my niece’s pregnancy shoot.  My baby pic was amazing."
"12489",1093582666,"Never been disappointed"
"12490",1093776653,"I didn’t really see any consequences for my actions (I just saw the same actions over and over again). I’ve been in so many plays and danced for so many girls.   Also, you just gave me the option to have my iteration kill themselves??? Why the heck would you so casually bring that up? How can I die of COPD but not be diagnosed with depression or something?   Finally, eating chocolate doesn’t make you ugly! Get that body-shaming bs out of here."
"12491",1093776653,"Good game, but it still doesn’t support IPhone X screens."
"12492",1093776653,"This game is wonderfully executed the only problems is that there should be more updates. It has so much more room to improve and it’s sad its developers haven’t done anything yet. The game is fun and challenging and has a great concept."
"12493",1093811993,"I love it but could u make the spa and photo booth and clinic free in the next update? I’d love that too :3"
"12494",1093811993,"I love it 🥰 you guy should get it  You dress up a pony and feed it,care about it and love it!!!! 🥰😍 But I don’t like that you have to buy SOME stuff.😕Bye! I love you guys 😘😘😘😘😘                      -Alina Ferenchuk ❤️❤️"
"12495",1093811993,"Utterly boring, all you do is dress her up and play games, there is nothing else you do, just those two things, add something like achievements or competitions, then it would be fun."
"12496",1093824646,"This app is not fun for me no hate but... you literally have to pay for almost EVERYTHING. the app makers give you the boring stuff for free ( and their aren’t very fun either)  and make you PAY for the actual quality fun parts. that’s just RUDE it would be cheaper just too go out to walmart and buy a composition notebook and write and draw in that! and it would be more fun too! AND THAT GOES FOR ALL OF TabTALE’S APPS!   overall... • i don’t recommend it • too expensive  • boring i don’t like this app at all....  👎👎👎👎"
"12497",1093824646,"I was excited to open this app but I hat the adds and the in app purchases. Come on! We already payed for the game!"
"12498",1093824646,"Honestly I don’t know why you would make people pay for the diary part it’s so dumb and if this is not fixed no one will download this game so I suggest you fix this now and fast 🙎🏼‍♀️😡🤯🤬😡"
"12499",1093825530,"Did game was a bore please fix it!"
"12500",1093825530,"I just don’t like it :("

"12505",1093833768,"This game is TERRABLE I downloaded it thinking OMG IM GONNA HAVE SO MUCH STUFF but NO!!!!! I LITTERALLY CANT USE ANY THING DONT GET THIS GAME ITS A WASTE OF TIME!"
"12506",1093833768,"It’s so good cause it’s like ur really doing it"
"12507",1093833768,"I give this game a 5 out of 5 because it is so much fun for girls and I really enjoy playing this game. I recommend this game for girls."
"12508",1093924230,"I was a huge fan of iAnnotate3, but this new version ruined the program. It has a fatal flaw in which it unpredictably fails to save your work locally. If you are not continuously connected to the cloud, your work will disappear. There are numerous comments online about this flaw, which the software developer has failed to fix. Unfortunately, I didn’t know about this, and I have lost literally THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in billed time because all my work simply disappeared. No warnings, nothing. Once I discovered the flaw. I re-created it repeatedly by annotating a PDF, closing it, and all my annotations would disappear - over and over again.   I have made the switch to PDF Expert, and will never look back. Given the software developer’s failure to fix this flaw despite multiple reports online,I will also never purchase another product made by Branchfire."
"12509",1093924230,"I got this app because iAnnotate 3 was great for searching through many PDFs for text (medical student looking for a specific detail in old notes). iAnnotate 4 does not do this very well or at all.  Edit 9/10/2019:  Update came out that was supposed to fix this problem. It hasn’t helped. I have sadly moved on from this app."
"12510",1093924230,"Can’t import local files or back them up first from the previous version of iAnnotate."
"12511",1094038347,"It's a great first offering from a new developer.... lots of originality, wonderful graphics and music... I really enjoyed it. The puzzles are good, but I think the interface makes it easier than it has to be. It would be more challenging with a different kind of interface. Still, it's a good game. I encountered a big glitch while playing and thought I couldn't finish, but when I went back in to get a screenshot for the dev, it was all resolved and I was able to finish the rest with no more problems. I appreciated that there was an epilogue but it's timed and I don't like timed games.... they make me tense and I play for relaxation.... so I started it but didn't finish. Still, there's a lot of good here."
"12512",1094038347,"I enjoyed the Secret Elevator Remastered and the Timed Add-On.  They were a welcome breath of fresh air in the sea of puzzle games I have played thus far.  The puzzles required more thought and thinking “outside the box” to complete.  If there’s one area that I was disappointed in, it would be the endings to both the original and timed games.  They were not as dynamic as I had expected and left me wanting more.  But, the overall games made-up for this slight disappointment.  I had a real sense of accomplishment when I finally completed each game.  The “Timed” Add-On added another element to an already challenging game.  I had to play it several times in order to successfully finish the game.  Looking forward to future endeavors.  The “skip” feature failed to work on my iPad Air 2 running the current IOS 11 software, which became frustrating as it took me several attempts to solve the Timed” Add-On."
"12513",1094038347,"DON'T PURCHASE - BUGS ABOUND!!!  Addendum to original review: I'm now in the train section of the game. It's clearly got a bug because there's a suitcase I cannot open. I've interacted with everything possible and I can no longer progress through the game. This is supposed to be a ""remastered"" version. I suspect it was just renamed in order to get more rubes like me to purchase it. Reducing rating to 1 star from 2. If I could give it a negative rating I would.   Original review: Purchased a couple of hours ago. Controls are simplistic at best. Easy enough to follow clues. Game glitches out randomly however, and you can only look around. If it's been a while since a save point, this can be annoying."

"12515",1094138419,"This game gets hard and fast and sometimes the cracks and the hit boxes are VERY agitating."

"12524",1094370858,"1-plz add pop ups to view photo such as insta or 3dtouch! and bach by swiping right! 2-plz timeline such as photo app of iphone to review and selection photoes! tnx"
"12525",1094370858,"Simple and intuitive. 3D Touch to preview picture is super useful. Deleted more than 100 pics in 2 minutes. Best app I hve found to clean up the photo library"
"12526",1094429166,"This game was amazing, I totally recommend it, it has so many twists and turns, unexpected events, and a perfect storyline. I got angry, sad, happy, I felt like I was there with Adams, I was able to visualize everything that happened, I felt like I was actually talking to a real person. This game is perfect for people who like being placed in different situations, good or bad, and to the developers, you have made a game that I can tell you gave your heart and soul in every detail, thank you."
"12527",1094429166,"This game is amazing!"

"12531",1094591345,"I really enjoy the game. Been playing since the beginning of the game. I think adding some Apple Watch features would be a great addition to the game. That way, we can capture Pokémon on the go instead of having to pull out phone."
"12532",1094603241,"It's a good game and all but there is 1 problem... IT'S RIGGED!!! When I'm in between the heads and my finger is NOT on my screen it still jumps!!!"
"12533",1094603241,"Impossible and I don't think you get an iPad all I have to say is impossible!!!!!😫😫"
"12534",1094603241,"I got 24 on the game. I'm number 3 in the world David Haskett. Do I actually get an iPad or is this just a lie... Game was hard at first but j got the hang of it"
"12535",1094833642,"My kid has been in love with this app since she was less than a year old. Almost 3 and it’s still a favorite. We got the expansion pack and totally worth it. The music is great and since we have to listen to it a lot, it’s nice to listen to something that I like too."
"12536",1094833642,"You know you should make more songs for the game plz"

"12545",1095003754,"I had acquired Hoverboard Simulator upon seeing the (beautifully designed) ad when I searched up the Asphalt racing series. I threw away asphalt 8 when I saw THIS! It's the best game I've possibly ever played in my life! The graphics are amazing, and the gameplay is seamless. The level of mastery required to win was so high, I spent hours perfecting my hoverboard skills. It is amazing, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Olympics suggested it as an official sport! I would become a champion if I did! In all, I can say that this game has changed the way I look at this world! Kudos to the genius behind this!"

Maybe some letter recognition and counting. I really love the color and shapes games for him but this one has a few things to iron out. Yes I'm still going to use it for the time being and over compensate for it short comings."

I have loved this game since I was three ( not the hospital) . I thought the last there was a new game I was 6 the last time there was  an update I was eight or nine. Please add more games. If you were wondering I have about 10 ideas 💡 for apps .   1. Airport  2. Hotel  3. Amusement Park  4. Pool  5. Jail  6. College 7. Pet Store       Some Update  8. Teens and Toddlers and Tweens 9. Seasons  10. Holidays    Carol 😜🐶😜"
"12554",1095280287,"Listen, your games are amazing! But if you want people to keep playing you have to up your game and add some new stuff. Some apartments and a college with some dorms would be great! There should be a bakery with cakes, cupcakes, cake pops, sugar cookies, there could be some birthday ones, Christmas ones etc.     A coffee shop would be great too. With muffins, hot chocolate, etc. like Starbucks! Christmas decorations that you can put on the house. Different aged kids too. And maybe even a new house! Thanks for reading"

"12596",1096287686,"Although this may be a phone application game, that is the last thing it feels like. You play a Crisis Line listener. Alex is the main character you talk to; he’s a police detective that takes you on the case he’s currently working. I’ve found myself emotionally invested in his story, as well as the actions and decisions he makes. The only problem I have with the game is that I wish there were more options for things to say back to Alex. Nonetheless, I always find myself just checking my phone waiting for his reply. It feels like you’re actually talking to this person. It will definitely leave you on the edge of your seat if you’re someone like me, interested in crime/the paranormal."
"12597",1096287686,"Sometimes the options it gives you are super limiting and frustraing and the path ends for seemingly no reason. The other annoying thing is that there aren’t any remotely halpy endings. I have played every single lifeline in the series and it always ends terrible, which makes the player feel like it was all a waste of time.   Still, I give it three stars for being interesting and spooky."

"12601",1096834193,"With all of Apple technology, you’d think they could come up with a remote app for Apple TV that actually works. Downloaded two days ago & it worked very well at first. Then one by one, each function stopped working. First closed caption couldn’t be turned on or off, then pause went. After that nothing worked. Lastly, it could no longer find the wi-fi. I deleted the app & reset every piece of equipment involved then reloaded the app. NOTHING. I’ve always been a big Apple fan but I’m beginning to wonder if the cost is just not worth it anymore."
"12602",1096834193,"Why is everything Apple turning out to be buggy or otherwise worthless? I've got 3 iPhones an iPad and Apple TV. They all have the latest OS yet they crash constantly or screen freezes. No, it's not a battery health issue. I'm just sick of all the problems I have with my devices while my Android Samsung friends are problem free. iTunes is a whole other beast. It has NEVER run correctly on any computer I've ever owned. Why? Why? Why? Bye!"
"12603",1096834193,"So every time I try to use it ,it says it needs to b connected to the same WiFi which it is but never connects smh really annoying"
"12604",1096918571,"This app is good but overall there are too many cons. First of all it makes my device and my friends’ devices reach high temperatures. Another reason is that it slows the entire device and I am not able to do anything else on my phone. No matter how good my WiFi is it seems as if the video quality is terrible. I am currently using the app at this very moment and my friend is hearing my voice a few seconds later after I speak, even though I have three bars of WiFi. I would expect that an app from google would be better quality but I guess not. This has made me second guess the quality of google apps/products."

"12624",1097200146,"WAY TOO MANY ADS!!!!"
"12625",1097469600,"This is a surprisingly addictive game.  And the more you play the more you start to figure out the best ways to use your special moves at the bottom of the screen and boost your score.  I'm enjoying it enough that I went ahead and paid for premium to support the dev."
"12626",1097469600,"First, they need to provide a way of contacting support other than Facebook.   Not everyone wants Facebook. When first installed the app takes about 124mb of storage on my iPad.   As I play it, it grows and grows.    I've had it almost reach 1 gb.     Ridiculous!     I have to uninstall and reinstall it to get back to a reasonable storage amount.   This badly needs to be fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"12632",1097587096,"Easy to pick up and really fun!"
"12633",1097587096,"I bought this game when it first came out. I am still hooked. I prefer Zen mode, which can be played at a leisurely pace. It's my go-to entertainment whenever I have a few minutes."

"12642",1097757301,"Kinda cool game at first, but as you keep playing it gets boring. There should be more features"
"12643",1097766064,"Love this game, I’m level 273 but the cakes you make are a loop. After so many, they start to repeat.

Maybe a add here and there but, this game is laggy and it gives me a add like every 1 minute and at the beginning it thought me how to move I was like “ok so that’s how you move and look around” BUT when I was walking and it wouldn’t let me do it at the same time I would walk and try and look around a the same time and it NEVER work all I have to say is GET RID OF THE GAME OR FLIPPING FIX THE GLITCHES"

"12648",1097821445,"Well I’m not trashing or dragging this game but it’s hard to control yourself and vehicles. But I think if they upgraded to something more recent and got better graphics it would be better. Though I only had it a total of minutes that’s because it kept crashing which is really annoying. But the back story is good. The game would be way better like I said before if they made better graphics, made us have more control over ourselves, if they update it to something more modern. But other than that the back story is good. That was my review. I think you should give this game a chance!"

"12653",1097895359,"I have played this before on a friends phone and just downloaded it. Unfortunately as soon as I open it it closes. The farthest I have gotten was into the first level, but when I touched the screen again, it closed again. I know that it is a great game so if you are reading reviews b4 getting the app I say get it bc it’s great it just appears to a have a glitch for some people. Anyway, if there is a solution I would love to here it."

"12660",1098006458,"Overall I enjoy playing this game. However, flying and parking are too difficult. In addition, I would like to be able to do other activities like other cars in the game."
"12661",1098041500,"All that family honor stuff is obnoxious as hell and taken to an extreme. I found it too stereotypical of Asian culture to be taken to be seriously and couldn't bear to read through all of it. Beyond the ancestral piety bs, not much of a story can be found."
"12662",1098041500,"The story was extremely linear. While the choices did change your stats, and the stats affected your choices, there were no ""multiple paths"" to follow. That was a big disappointment to me.    Another big disappointment was your name... Because you can't change it. And while your family and roommates call you other names ""like Cat, or Ghost, or names you have a say in"" there is no ""input your own name""  There's only one romance as far as I could see. That might be a creative choice on your part, but I think it would have been better to at least have two, so the player can feel like there actually making a choice, rather than forcing this one character on the player. (Not only that, but I wasn't a big fan on the only romanceable character anyways)  In other words, this wasn't my favorite COG game yet. The writing was decent actually, but the lack of actual story-changing choices was a real disappointment."
"12663",1098041500,"While the premise and story are interesting, the pressures of conforming to Chinese ettiquette and manners is mentally exhausting. The focus on indirectness also comes off as insincere."

Ok, I’m a little sensitive, but all I asked for was a proposal dinner.😡 P.S. I feel bad about your critical notes. Hey, if mine is, write me and tell me. Also, can you respond to my 1st email?

How do I go forward when I’m prohibited from getting into the next game. I do not like the Expeditions at all and do not want to play them. Am I at the end for this Mahjong?"
"12670",1098207701,"Should have listened to the reviews. What a disappointment.  App never finds me an opponent through game center.    Contacted app developer.  Waste of money."
"12671",1098207701,"The only reason this app hasn’t been deleted is that SushiGo is my absolute favorite card game.   I don’t understand why they had to reinvent the wheel by only showing the symbols until you click on a card. Just show us the cards themselves! Single click, all the info we need.   Has the rules surrounding wasabi changed? In my interpretation of the rules, wasabi can be moved and played on existing nigiri."
"12672",1098207701,"Multiplayer is why I purchased the game because we love the card game.  Multiplayer is so incredibly laggy it’s nearly unplayable."
"12673",1098208851,"just started playing, really fun. only complaint is it tells you purchasing a character will remove ads, I did & it didn’t. so I had to spend more money to turn off the ads (there are so many you have to in order to enjoy the game)"
"12674",1098208851,"Great game, need new characters though fun goals tying to unlock them"

"12677",1098209028,"It's ok but not a real colouring book until it can be used with Apple Pencil. Needs Apple Pencil support asap."
"12678",1098209028,"This restriction to only touch paint is droll. I want to use my Apple Pencil and fill in, have the option of 'pouring' paint or using strokes. That way, if I don't want to stay within the lines or if I want to add to the sketch I could!"

"12681",1098307964,"If the store allowed a negative rating these people would earn it. This game looks good and sounds good but it’s a nonstop cash grab bunch of crooked developers soiling the name of a legendary band. I’ve played this game for well over a year and this week they’ve decided to LOCK all skills earned or purchased and require another purchase to UNLOCK items. They want you to pay twice?!! They are dirtbag crooks and should be banned from the Ap store."
"12682",1099092384,"No onscreen controls. No pinching, zooming, manual control of perspective. Waste. Refund time."
"12683",1099092384,"There's no fast forward, scrub or anything for a video. I love there's no download or anything to a video from the library. I have to watch a video from the beginning to end, tap and it pauses? That's the most important, next is to set a point of view with the fingers. Videos start off default where I automatically have to turn my head to get to the right position, want to be able to pinch to perfect position. Will rate 5 stars when at least the fast forward/back is fixed."
"12684",1099092384,"This app is great for viewing VR images. Images can be viewed directly on screen or in a VR Headset. Can load multiple images and cycle through them by tapping the screen.

"12688",1099176816,"Sophisticated and feature rich. Really blown away by the multi-layer flexibility, start and stop anywhere, probe deeper into the characters when you want to, interpretations and definitions when you need them. Very well thought out and executed."
"12689",1099176816,"Most of us have had to read one or two of Shakespeare’s plays in high school. But the problem was that Shakespeare was the last thing we were thinking about. The difficulty of language was a turn off, teachers themselves were not experts in the writing either, so what was the relevance to us? But I think Shakespeare is better appreciated when you have accumulated more personal experience meeting people and delving into some current affairs. I found Shakespeare a more pleasurable experience trying to learn it on my own free time and that is where this app really helps. It has annotations for the entire Tempest play and recorded voice work. So in addition to reading, you get to really ‘listen’ to the words and the different pronunciations. Through this app, it made me confident to say that although Shakespeare is difficult, it does not mean that it can’t be fun. If you take the time and take a leap of faith with this app, I promise that you will have a better appreciation of Shakespeare and create an approachable and optimistic view of classic literature."

I go to the MIDI Learn page which highlights all of the various on-screen controls, and it says I should select one of the controls and then hit a MIDI note on my hardware device, but I can’t even select anything on the screen. I can long-tap to clear the MIDI mapping that exists already, but I can’t seem to tap to add a new one. With the exact same setup and settings, I don’t have this problem on DM1. I would email the developer but the “App Support” links to Facebook - they don’t have a real website."
"12693",1099179070,"So I can use the drone machine but there is a high pitched wave constantly even with all the channels turned down. Drone machine boxes are disabled in the instrument tab or whatever. Bought it for the drone machine part. Unusable so far."
"12694",1099420627,"Not bad but an ad every third loss? That's ridiculous. Try every 5 or maybe every 10... So many ads I only play for like 5 minutes"

"12698",1099703034,"Great idea to make a space marine version of battle chess .. it was a great game and still is if you enjoy chess then this will take it to a new Level...after all what couldn’t be better than space marines and orks 😁"

"12700",1099735932,"Starts out as a mildly fun, if not random, pachinko game. The randomness makes it silly impossible by about level 5. Uncontrollably bouncing through fires so that you die in one or two turns is... kind of anticlimactic. Needs some balancing and it could be worthwhile."
"12701",1099735932,"Retro throwback game. Arkanoid meets Smash TV. Amazing soundtrack and a steal for $0.99"
"12702",1099735932,"Pleasing to all the senses. So glad i took a chance on this. This will fight Alto's Adventure for my mobile gaming time now.  Support this talented developer!"
"12703",1099862552,"Yea, I definitely enjoy this game. Fun, fast pace, and has a lot to offer for customization, plus I like how your not forced to watch a ad every 5 seconds. My only problem is that the days feel way to fast, even for a higher level, but besides that, I really enjoyed it :)"
"12704",1099862552,"Don’t beg for ratings. It’s annoying. Had to give it a rating so it will go away. Otherwise, cute game."
"12705",1099862552,"It’s fun and easy to play. Just wish they would add descriptions of the smith’s special abilities"
"12706",1099950549,"I was enjoying the game until, like other gamers, I got to a place where the game stopped responding. For me, it was at the shooting range. I could select the bullet while in any other location, but at the range I couldn't select anything in my inventory. If I clicked on hints, it told me to use the bullet with the gun, but it wouldn't respond. I tried rebooting, backing out and coming back in, waiting a few weeks...nothing. I wasted my money on this; don't make the same mistake. (I am using an iPad Air 2.)"
"12707",1099950549,"Either this game is in serious need of an update or it is just sloppy. Hard to figure out sequences and slow responses. Garbage"
"12708",1099950549,"This game was clearly intended for larger screens. I play Tons of these HOPs and found it nearly impossible to read the captions. Games were actually so hard that I had to skip the majority of them and that was a surprise though. That was the only high point. Disappointed by this one Eipix!! You usually put out good titles."
"12709",1099995778,"Right off the bat, I am stuck because no matter how hard I try, I can't control the lock on the safe. Waste of money."
"12710",1099995778,"I enjoyed this and feel it deserves a good rating. I liked the variety of challenges and found it not as confusing as many I have played. There were zero glitches too! ☺️👍🏻 So many games don't let me finish because they don't work properly."
"12711",1099995778,"Im surprise with some below average reviews. I thought the game was original and fun. In my opinion worth buying on sale."
"12712",1100023494,"Thought the game was good, but some of the puzzles were hard to get to work.  Good overall."
"12713",1100023494,"I enjoyed this game!!"
"12714",1100023494,"Overall I enjoyed this game, except it seemed to drag things out by constantly having to tap backward & forward to change scenes. Also, whoever wrote the script/narrations obviously has poor command of the English language or the editor didn't do a good job proofing spelling/grammar."
"12715",1100029269,"Just like most other BF games just a different story line & I think this was one of the worst I've played!! Forgot how much I paid, like 2.99. Cheesy characters and animated voices. Constantly have to go back and forth between scenes constantly. Only a few HO if you can call it that, more like find 5 leaves or feathers, or at most 5 objects that are too easy.  Wasn't worth 10Cents."
"12716",1100029269,"I would loved to have given the game 5 stars but after I didn't pick up an item I needed later in the game, I then found I couldn't go back for it.  Other than that I thought the game was great."
"12717",1100029269,"I was most of the way through the game when it became glitchy and crashed. On restart, lost items from inventory and couldn't go forward. This is the 1st in quite a while and it ticks me off."
"12718",1100092726,"This game is awful"
"12719",1100092726,"So you want a fun addicting game that is simaler to stack but you want something different or if you need a fun game that doesn't take up much storage that you will play well this is the game for you it is really fun and let me tell you you will come back again and again to play to try to bet your high score not only that you get cool stuff that you can buy in the store no money costed it has lots of different game modes that you can choose from and each are very fun and enjoyable no I am not hired to write this I really think this is a good and fun game that you should get cause you'll play it and won't regret getting it"
"12720",1100092726,"A very addictive game with a variety of different levels. It's fun, however it does have a lot of ads. Great for when you're bored with some time to kill."
"12721",1100094604,"This is one of the best apps to have and it is always fun"
"12722",1100094604,"I like playing in my spare time"
"12723",1100094604,"There are so much things to do and the game has no problems at all and the progression system is amazing."
"12724",1100110635,"Most of the upper interface is cut off on the iPhone XR.   Please adjust accordingly."
"12725",1100110635,"Started off working good now it just stopped giving money can’t get money when not playing can’t upgrade going to delete just letting you know who reads this don’t waste your time"
"12726",1100110635,"I recently downloaded this game and really enjoy it, but the idle function not working is preventing any progress while I’m away. It’s pretty frustrating. If this is fixed I can give this game a 5 star review. The voices and animations are all awesome. I really hope this gets fixed."
"12727",1100139790,"Fun game, but graphics keep getting stuck and no game reset."
"12728",1100139790,"My toddler loves this game and plays it over and over. But ever since the update about two months ago, there’s a bug when you deliver ore to Skya, Ton Ton gets stuck. The only way to free him, is by earning a letter with another trux. But if you’ve earned all the letters, your SOL. No feedback form in the app to submit bugs, otherwise I’d give this app 4 stars."
"12729",1100139790,"I hate this app because it’s to hard. and it’s not a good game"
"12730",1100147750,"I love your game and all of your games"
"12731",1100147750,"I’m on the Freight Truck mission 36. Whenever the trailer hits a car, the trailer goes all crazy and starts flinging itself into the air. Up to the point where it lands from a great height and says I crashed."
"12732",1100147750,"There is a problem with this game I download it and it comes up as one through five is already done and then starting with six it says to Buy this level with the money and I click on it and it won't buy it so I can't advance to the next car can y'all see if y'all can do anything about that just tell me if there is a way to fix it"
"12733",1100292960,"It’s a great game!"
"12734",1100292960,"How can this game possibly not have online multiplayer in this day and age? A total waste of effort and relegated to the dustbin of history. Guess I’ll go play some Caracassone."
"12735",1100292960,"It’s an okay game on a tablet, but the rules are not clearly instructed, the campaign is senselessly hard (luck is critical for certain missions) and the game is lacking an undo button for simple mistakes like over/under rotating a piece and accidentally placing it as such.  The actual board game is vastly superior, not simply as a matter of preference, but in the actual quality of game play."
"12736",1100331256,"This b*tch is fun"
"12737",1100331256,"Good game for the train. Just enough to pass the time.  Still good."
"12738",1100331256,"I love the dots franchise, really I do. But it is painfully obvious with this iteration that you absolutely do NOT complete levels if the game does not want you to OR unless you spend money. It’s unfortunate. I understand a need for profit but how about just charging me a cost for the game and then giving me a fair shake? Even the game mechanics do not behave consistently which is very frustrating (I.e. I have two lasers in one row but when both are used only one stone block is cleared). The companions who have power ups to “help” you usually end up ruining your strategy and make things more difficult.   I like the concept of these games, I just wish developers thought more about their supporters than their pockets."
"12739",1100472035,"This game is great! I've showed it to our three year old and every night before bed he wants to play Blocko! and every night he wants to see if Level 5 is open!   I've been impressed with this game and more so with how quickly he is learning to use logic to solve these puzzles.   We hope someone for GT will see the and post an update soon!   Thanks  4/12/18   Our three year old is now about to turn 5 in a few weeks... any progress on the new level? If not, please remove the coming soon...   Thank you"
"12740",1100472035,"I like the simplicity of playing this in portrait mode with one thumb. No ads no annoying pop ups. Please create more games like this."
"12741",1100472035,"Clever approach to classic slider type puzzles.  Great game play and Fun to play. Challenging enough to make you think, but not so hard that it's frustrating. No timers, lives, or what have you - just your brain against the puzzle.  Highly recommended. Thanks for making it."
"12742",1100591575,"Really love this game. It's well thought out and really quite beautiful. It is a challenging game and well worth the many hours spent crushing beams in its soothing pastel world."
"12743",1100591575,"It might be a great game???? Wouldn't know.   Sorry, I have many better things to do than sit around trying to GUESS how to play a game.  Hell, reading instructions would be just one of those many things. Actually playing the game with an understanding of what the moves and goals are would be another.  But I guess I'm going to go with deleting a game whose developers were too lazy or dense to provide any instructions instead."
"12744",1100591575,"I read the reviews about lack of instructions so decided to look on the App Store to see if there was anything to explain how to play this game.  There was, and the game is very simple, only cross same color lines. The dots at the top are a time bar to tell you how long each color will last and it's different each color.  I played for a couple minutes and was able to get up to seven same color lines crossed. It wasn't hard to play but wasn't that interesting or relaxing for me either. I'll probably keep the app on for a little while and see if I play it again and feel differently."
"12745",1100636064,"This app is amazing, it's like second soundcloud but way better, i can listen to all of my favourite music and download it. Hope u will evolve it more <3 <3 <3"
"12746",1100636064,"The application interface is friendly and easy to use, easy to set the songs I like on a list"
"12747",1100636064,"Good app, unlimited music and high quality, I can create a custom list of favorite songs general, listen to music every day helps the mind at ease, I will recommend it to my friends. I love it😍😍"
"12748",1100694944,"Very good game for $4. Kids have fun playing."
"12749",1100694944,"I bought this game for my three year old and she was bored within seconds. This game is mind-numbing. I wish I hadn't wasted $2."
"12750",1100694944,"I bought this app for my kid who loves curious George. Everyday for a week my kid would tell me he completed the first island but could not advance. I did not believe him so I tried it out myself. After completing all 10 levels, I could not advance. My friend downloaded the app and scored 3 stars on all levels but had the same problem as well. Overall, its a fun game for the ten levels you get."
"12751",1100723148,"I have bought tokens but they seem to disappear without using them.  Apple confirms that I’ve paid for them but they are not credited to my token account. I want to purchase enhancements and the program says I am low in tokens. Help!!"
"12752",1100723148,"Best little secret for true creatives."
"12753",1100723148,"Firstly, I actually bought all the additional style packs but one. The styles say high definition readymade templates. This can be assumed by many people as the styles are ALREADY signature level detailed templates...they are not. That’s an additional charge each level of sharpness you want. Wahhh? Seriously?   Second, the level of “AI” is a slider lol. You can see where your original line in an abstract digital painting for example was. It’s a filter. Pikazo styles get extremely similar the more you edit with the app. That’s awful when the templates CAN be much more amazing.   Thirdly, almost every app now has layers, offer double exposure options, ACTUAL filter editing (HSL, opacity, contrast etc etc)...and more. We want REAL editing options. Make OUR art not look the literal same as everyone else’s.   Printing is a cool idea but again not if the picture isn’t sharp. Charging us more is outright ridiculousness.   Make a REAL update please."
"12754",1100797913,"This is a fun game. The low star reviews are just people who can’t handle the real life challenges this game brings. It’s worth the money. Believe it, I’ve probably downloaded and played over 200 games on iOS"
"12755",1100797913,"Plz update this app"
"12756",1100797913,"This game needs a major update the car don’t even have enough power and they don’t even go over obstacles you guys need to add 4low and lock differentials"
"12757",1100810556,"Fun game, no too hard, not too easy."
"12758",1100810556,"Have enjoyed all the Hidden Expedition games. Hope there are more new ones soon."
"12759",1100810556,"This game made me appreciate the features that Eipix always includes: the repayable puzzles and HOPs, and the ability to go back and pick up collectibles. I hate finishing a game and not knowing if I got all the collectibles, or finding I don’t have all the puzzle pieces and there’s no way to get them except doing it all over. I really enjoy replaying the HOPs and getting gold and 100% error free for each one. This game also had unusual scenes and an interesting plot."
"12760",1100883805,"Every time I try to do anything on it lately it logs me out and kick me out of the game! I’m sick of it. I don’t want to delete the game but it coming to come down to it!"
"12761",1100883805,"I’ve had this game downloaded for awhile. The game is awesome. Little long on bud times I think. But still fun to play. I recently changed my Facebook. The game will not allow me to change it. 2. I’ve recently subscribed to the newsletter, I got the success email but no potbucks have been deposited. 3rd. When I watch the videos I don’t receive my potbucks. None at all. I hope to resolve these issues. But in the meantime I’m still playing. 💨🤙🏼"
"12762",1100883805,"Getting really tired of not getting rewards for video ads"
"12763",1101109456,"i love this game but when disaster strikes you can’t keep everybody happy and while that is fair it just hits you one after another like i had a war then a fire then the death of a noble and the priesthood conspiracy so like chill out i couldn’t even do anything in between those events."
"12764",1101109456,"Good way to pass times and makes you think sometimes"
"12765",1101109456,"I love this game and recommend it to all! It's really fun I enjoy the fact that you can make your own choices! My dad loves this game too! Great game for all ages. 😀"
"12766",1101141411,"miss one prisioner"
"12767",1101141411,"Way too many ads. Outrageous to be subjected to numerous 30 second ads. Even going back to the Home menu triggers yet another ad."
"12768",1101141411,"No just no"
"12769",1101399354,"Even buying Big Fish games is not enough. Just trying to relax and not be interrupted to review their games. They’re just like Trump."
"12770",1101399354,"Enjoyed playing. The game does have all the things I enjoy in hidden object games. I like the morphing objects, collectibles and picture fragments in the scenes. I did have the game freeze up on me one time requiring me to reload it and start again. That is my reason for not giving it 5 stars."
"12771",1101399354,"Awesome game"
"12772",1101436320,"Two stars. 1) Because I love TLC and 2) because I love being able to watch my shows at any time.   BUT.   It is so totally aggravating that I can’t fast forward to the part of the show I left off on without sitting through every one of the 3 minute ads I already sat through, AND I can’t rewind even 2 minutes if I skipped ahead too far (after sitting through the ads again) without watching ANOTHER ad. It is excessive. It is obnoxious. The ads are longer than any other streaming service, and it takes away from the relaxation of evening TV.   Fix the ad problem."
"12773",1101436320,"There are plenty binge worthy shows on TLC but the app needs some help. I don’t suffer from the commercial problem.. not sure why. I get 4-5 commercials ever so often, not the 8-12 some others say they get.   However... it continuously tells me “this program is for users who subscribe to TLC” WHILE my account is logged in.. and I do have TLC in my cable subscription. I’ll watch a few episodes in a row (I usually put something on my phone while I clean, cook dinner, etc) and then when the 3rd or 4th episode starts, I magically “don’t subscribe to TLC” and it won’t play.. I then have to log out and log in to be able to watch it. Super annoying.   Also - I watch with the app on the fire stick as well. Yes, we have cable but I rarely use it lol we just use the apps and pick and choose what to watch when we want. So I go to pick up where I left off on a TLC show on my tv that I started on my phone - it’s never accurate. It’s always further behind than I really am or further ahead"
"12774",1101436320,"Tv provider connection won’t work. Won’t let you sign in. No point to download."
"12775",1101472953,"I have ALWAYS loved these games and I have always loved big fish games"
"12776",1101472953,"This is an excellent long-play game with lots of new puzzles and extra bonuses. I loved it! It kept me entertained for hours on end."
"12777",1101472953,"I started buying the Big Fish games after playing one that was really great LEGAL LIGHT: SILENT MOUNTAIN. I thought they would all be like that game but they are obviously made by different game designers. The puzzles in this one only made sense about 10% of the time. Some of the things you had to do in the puzzles were just silly and no way you could figure it out without clicking aimlessly on everything. I found myself frequently clicking on the hint button and rolling my eyes ay the solution. At this point, I’m just hoping to the story ends soon."
"12778",1101501512,"I tried to place a purchase for 20 min and each time I saved the billing address, the app would automatically switch the shipping address (even though the button to sync them was off) and then when I updated the shipping address, it would clear all of my billing information so that I would have to re-enter. It literally wouldn’t let me make a purchase! Super frustrating! I ended up using my computer instead, but just a bummer to have wasted so much time trying to buy their product."
"12779",1101501512,"I love Lush, their products, and everything they do for charity work, but their app has a few problems that makes the experience less enjoyable. The website will show how many reviews it has and you can click on the reviews and read them. On the app, the number of reviews are typically wrong (ex. One product might have 600+ reviews on the website, but on the app it shows zero), and you can’t view the reviews. I love you Lush but please fix the app!"
"12780",1101501512,"For the love of God. I love you guys so much. I’ve given this feedback via your support before. But, please put gift message/receipts as an option during check out in the app. I buy gifts for my girls and family members all the time and I have to go out of my way to find a computer or specifically use the web browser on my phone. I have to go out of my way to not use this app when I want to."
"12781",1101582722,"You can only keep playing if you spend money."
"12782",1101582722,"No explanation of reproduction time. And no way to pause passage of time to assess inventory."
"12783",1101582722,"Decided to replay the game after the last war patch, and I am glad to say it is a better game now for it than it was previously. Could still use a better English translation, but the current build I see so far is definitely better."
"12784",1101675121,"I HATE THIS GAME! I CAN'T GET PAST 3! IT'S SO DIFFICULT! MAKE AN EASIER CATCH THE BUS GAME!"
"12785",1101675121,"The tardis was hilarious brings back memories. Great game."
"12786",1101675121,"Why can't u do 0 stars??????!?!?"

"12788",1101691540,"When I got on the game it was laggy and I don't find people to play with 😡"
"12789",1101691540,"I can change my skin!"
"12790",1101848745,"I'm about to delete this game because there no options to get to a higher level if you can't fulfill the tasks. I've tried on 3 different devices to eat 3 ladybugs and it's just not going to happen."
"12791",1101848745,"This game has great graphics but there just needs to be more to it. I mean, there are no rewards,no incentive, no real reason to keep playing. I have gotten all the frogs and even when you complete a ''challenge "" it's no big deal, you don't get anything! Heck now the ""bar"" isn't even moving anymore. Like I said, could be a good game, right now, so-so."
"12792",1101848745,"It won't open it crashes all the time. I haven't even got to play it! I just bought it and I don't get it. I'm so mad!!! Fix it or I wan my money back!! Now..!!"
"12793",1102339559,"Just downloaded the app and made a map for a bus route for tomorrow. Put in about 30 addresses and tried to email a link to someone else who is helping me pick people up. Looks like I can't email a link. He has the app too. In the process of trying to email my finger accidentally hit the delete button. lol. Any way you can add a ""are you sure you want to delete"" option? How about email option? I would gladly pay more $$$. Excellent app!"
"12794",1102339559,"Hi I love your app because I can place pins on a map for areas of interest. I’m using relay to plan a trip to New Orleans this spring. I suggest being able to add directions/lines to show your travel route and travel time (whether walking, driving, biking, or public transit) would be awesome too. Right now I had to write my whole itinerary in my notes and just used your app to see how close my saved places are in relation to one another so I have to go back and fourth between your app and my notes and google maps to get around how I want... which is a little too much juggling. I would love to use your app to plan a more detailed itinerary. I like the app but please make it a little more handy!"
"12795",1102339559,"Really handy app! However, for long travel where adding a lot of destinations are necessary, a macOS version of this would be extremely helpful. It’s very difficult to add lots of points on an iPhone."
"12796",1102346079,"pls add more cars and places and destruction in the coming updates,a very great game"
"12797",1102346079,"This game is really good but the problem is the game needs more content like new cars and tires and stickers maps and obstacles  creator if you read this please and this content 👍"
"12798",1102346079,"This game has a arcade fell to and it's realistic which is god this game has potential to be number1 on top charts just one thing tho can they make it easier to unlock cars if not I understand 😃😃😃😃😃"
"12799",1102362078,"It is so not fun and it is hard to understand 😵😵😵"
"12800",1102362078,"I love this game so much"

"12803",1102364578,"Amazing"
"12804",1102364578,"It helps me build up the habit to do more floor work! Amazing results! Highly recommended!"
"12805",1102411902,"Thanks!"
"12806",1102411902,"The game is not too hard, but not too easy. Very logical.  I was surprised when I thought the game was over, but I started over and thought ""remember your logic!""  Can't wait to find more apps like this.  Plus it's free with very few ads."
"12807",1102411902,"One inventory item is hidden a little too well. Otherwise, clues are hard but mostly manageable."
"12808",1102448232,"Loved it"

"12815",1102508135,"I like the game even at my age. My problem is I have neuro problem. It’s a little hard to turn the iPad the other way to play these games that are sideways to me. I still like to play this apt."
"12816",1102508135,"I've been waiting for levels past 280 for about a month. Please update, or I'm just going to delete."

"12819",1102520605,"Used to be an interactive look at current political races, now it’s just a newsfeed of regular politics articles. No more interactive charts. Where are they?"
"12820",1102742855,"As a long time pilot and a fan of the Red Bull Air Race series, I was excited to see this app.  I have reached the max level of updates for both of the Class D planes I have gotten for free in the app.  Tried buying gold but the purchases never registered. I have reached as far as I can go in the game without a Class C plane to remain competitive.  My maxed out upgrades for my planes are no longer fast enough to win.  This game needs to be updated so those pilots who do well are rewarded with more than just rivets and bolts!  Give us more blueprints.  I am not going to overpay your ridiculous prices for “gold” to purchase more blueprints so I can build more planes.  I would rather spend that money putting real gas in real airplanes and going flying...for real. I also have come close to pylons in a 90 degree bank and it registers as a pylon hit.  When in a 90 degree bank, there needs to be the option to use the elevator to tighten the turn and increase turn rate. Not realistic flying characteristics at all.  Needs updating....period.  I am losing interest in this game."
"12821",1102742855,"Is it just me or anyone else can’t load the game after last update? I can’t play at all...."
"12822",1102742855,"It keeps me from playing it...it loading at the beginning over and over and over...again.... but other than that it’s awesome app!!"
"12823",1102810225,"No I’m not liking it you replace the original Furby how could you this is not nice of a replacement I hate this so much please bring back the original Furbies and make this   go away"

"12827",1102814563,"I bought this app (well I bought the bundle) for my son since he has all the other Pepi apps and loves them. While he does seem to like these apps the big issue is that there is no sound unless your using headphones. I have this issue with all 3 apps from the bundle. My son is only 5 so it is not a typical thing for me to allow him to wear headphones when using his iPad. I already did a trouble shooting with apple and the issue is only with the apps in this bundle. Would love for it to work and function fully."
"12828",1102814563,"It needs clothes and more things to do in it all you can do is cook,play with Instruments, sleep, drive TO NO WHERE, and there is not even enough beds and you could you plzzzzz add more stuff to do one time when I got this game it was 1 year ago in 2018 and now it is 2019 and it march and I got all the games back Pepi hospital pepi store and all the other games that I had BUT still I deleted it one time because the rooms where money and I bought it but then I am like UGH ITS SOOOOO BORNING and I tryed to rp which means roleplay but I had to delete it and here I am now typeing about this game and it’s 2019 and when come back and get the games and I hope for something diffent Nope so then I start to Wright this very very long story and what you should make and re-do with it sooo more and more and more people can have this game so do a update or make it more fun."

"12830",1102828488,"I love the Emily delicious games and have played them for years. My favorite is the first Christmas one but can’t seem to find it anymore. Any chance of bringing that one back?"
"12831",1102828488,"Addictive. Challenging and fun"
"12832",1103201207,"Bought this an it just disappeared . Scam!!!!!!!"
"12833",1103201207,"Was under the impression I purchased he remaining puzzles and when my son used the app today discovered the purchases had disappeared. Came here to find out that it’s a MONTHY FEE to use the puzzles. What a scam. The app is great and works phenomenally but charging a monthly fee for two second puzzles is baffling. Maybe attempt to be less greedy or at least be up front that it’s monthly fee and not an outright purchase."
"12834",1103201207,"Toddler loves this games however very deceiving with charge.  It’s a monthly cost.  Very disappointed with this not being upfront"
"12835",1103278932,"This thing has hair trigger controls so death comes easily and often and every time DOUBLE ads are played which is absolute nonsense. Such an approach to free to try is annoying and nonsense. Shame you didn’t just put this out to straight up buy from the start and bypass the irritation. Then again looking at other reviews you can pay and STILL gets ads. Move on from this developer there are too many other good ones out there that don’t resort to petty tactics."
"12836",1103278932,"This game has gotten me fully addicted. The ads can wait. I don’t care. I have played and then deleted the game multiple times but I always realize that I should’ve kept it. LOVE THIS GAME."
"12837",1103278932,"I don’t see why there’s so many negative reviews. It’s a great game and I love the music it comes with."
"12838",1103310426,"I LOVE my town but the fashion show definitely isn’t my favorite. There is not many good outfits and I can’t believe there is a sponge bob outfit! Who would even wear that? I wouldn’t. If you could replace outfits like those with better ones that would be amazing and u would get a 4 star review. Also, you need to add more characters because it says that there is all the good characters in it but there isn’t so plz add more characters!!! If u add more characters and made better outfits, I would give u a 5 star."
"12839",1103310426,"The game is so fun !You can have a contest to see which one Is better and more!Plese keep making my town apps their  Amazing!!!!🙂👌👍🏻💖🤗"

"12845",1103570293,"Amazing game. Just... Amazing. Dobsoft just makes the absolute awesome games!!"
"12846",1103570293,"Awesome game! Addicted!"
"12847",1103631263,"Paid no ads, still get promo vids of other games when wanting to continue current game, not cool."
"12848",1103631263,"I love this game! I thought it was super hard at first but I gradually improved and it feels like my visual-spatial area of brain is improving. I like that there are also achievements, however I find that the game is slow in recognizing some of them. For instance, I've bought all skins with coins, at least what I can see but it will says I have more to buy. Kind of weird. Other than that it's a great game. Ads aren't that bad when you can skip, plus they're really short!"
"12849",1103631263,"Fun game and I like the concept but every time you make a mistake you have to start over. I would prefer where you continue on to different levels and start using more strategy not just speed until you die then have to start all over again."
"12850",1103679001,"Love it"
"12851",1103679001,"The app dosnt work. When i slide up to play a game i click on the app and it crashes. For all of them. Then i have to restart my iphone. ( i have an iphone 6s + )"
"12852",1103679001,"It does work it is worth 99 cents so you. Should definitely buy it"
"12853",1103804173,"You will be hooked by this fast-paced arena shooter! Amazing graphics and no pay-to-play mechanics along with a good an unique art style is worth the $2.99 you have to pay. Enjoy the game everyone! Thank you devs for making this amazing game!"
"12854",1103804173,"This game is amazing! Every aspect of the game is very well done, from the menus down to the gameplay. You can tell the developers put a lot of time into this game. As for the comment of 0 replay ability well that is totally bogus. This game is a high score chaser, so that right there is incentive to replay! Awesome game guys, I hope to see more games from you in the future!"
"12855",1103804173,"Pretty fun game, no issues whatsoever."
"12856",1103901846,"Wonderful game but it would be nice if there were more of the rare ingredients to get potions or clues as to which cases have more of them."
"12857",1103901846,"I finished the game a couple months ago and there’s still no update for new content . I love the game though. Thanks."

"12859",1104124222,"There's nothing here that you can't get from a better app for free :/"
"12860",1104124222,"So it's a good app, I downloaded it for free to style some of my pics. But then about two weeks after I got the app, an email came in saying I had been charged 1.99 for the app?!?! What is this random charge they've given me? There's no talk of it in the details on the App Store, nor within the app at all!! Not too happy"
"12861",1104124222,"The app doesn't even work.... it sits stagnant with out any options, not even the only button on the screen has no working features"

"12872",1104415942,"This is a amazing game and the best part is that it’s uncharted my favorite game series of all time this game is great and hard or should I say crushing"
"12873",1104415942,"Loved everything about this game. Great way to get items for multiplayer for uncharted 4/the list legacy. Enjoyed!!"
"12874",1104486867,"Like the interface. Like that it uses DarkSky. Don’t like that the widget takes so long to show anything, if at all.  My experience with the widget has been poor."
"12875",1104486867,"I mostly use Weather apps for basic checking of weather forecast. This does much much more, but the basics are still easy to access (love the Siri shortcut stuff). It is also well designed them in aesthetic viewpoint as well as the user interface design."
"12876",1104486867,"I’ve tried most. Great user interface and one handed use gestures. Use the hourly graph to quickly see temps, winds, humidity, etc."
"12877",1104692136,"Uhh"
"12878",1104692136,"If this game is online, how can it work without internet ?"

"12880",1104795347,"Google photos, Facebook and SFTP don’t works.  Please fix it!"
"12881",1104795347,"This might be a great product but how would anyone know. There is absolutely no manual, help filed or even a hint on how to use this product.  It touted things like SMB/CIFS SUPPORT or SYNCHRONIZATION SUPPORT but trying to figure how to use them is a total bazaar.   When you try to get support you must use Twitter or Facebook.  When you click on support you get either a blank screen or opens up a Outlook configuration screen.  I wish I had my money back.  You would do better with a stone table and a chisel."
"12882",1104795347,"Please add recycle bin 🙏"
"12883",1104814161,"It's a really nice scavenger hunt type of game. If I could offer a suggestion, maybe add an extra floor or even have paid dlc for more floors or apartments with different people and harder to find items. As of now, it seems a bit short and easy to do, if an extra floor is added I'll change it to 5 stars"

"12886",1104816326,"I got the record/loop feature to work once. After that, it's unresponsive and no combination of actions changed that. I did exactly as the video showed, pushed the circle, got my loop, and pushed the triangle... no loop. Pushed plus where the circle once was, no change. I really don't get what I'm doing wrong here and it's irritating."
"12887",1104816326,"This is probably my favorite app. But I can't get it to work on iPhone 7. Had the same problem on 5s."
"12888",1104816326,"Could benefit from some more robust/granular settings and the ability to record and download a session (instead of just a sample loop), but in general this is pretty bangin. Good dynamic range (you can really lay down a bass line on this with some practice and a good amp/pair of headphones), some nice tones, really intuitive and fluid for constructing loops, adding to them, and breaking them down on the fly. Considering incorporating it into performance."
"12889",1104855278,"充值玩家，V10+的，这里要狠喷。蚩尤版本前的画风、任务还不错。后面的版本是策划和美术太次还是公司股东想圈钱了。弄的我这高VIP玩家都看不下去了；明抢，新人物还巨丑巨俗。本来好好的画风呢，非要改的俗。加了各种鬼扯的升装备伤害得圈钱玩法，而且玩个仙侠游戏好好的嫦娥设计成日系暴露萝莉真特么醉了。转战有良心的国外游戏厂商作品了。"

"12904",1104986393,"This is a really cool concept but I can’t play the other games without buying them, so if you only want to play pong for free this is the game for you"
"12905",1104986393,"Not only is there the one dollar cost of the app, then you have to pay more for the only games, also, I can’t get the impossible pong game to work. And a suggestion, you should add a crossy road knock off, and change it so that multiple games can be accessed from the Notification Center at the same time."
"12906",1104986393,"The free one is the only one that works! I payed for full and they are all broken! I wish you could get app refunds..."
"12907",1105294926,"I love the game but there’s just to much ads and i saw cars on top of each other in the game and No update hope you guys can do something about that"
"12908",1105294926,"This game is boring plus you pay for the game yet you still get these annoying ads!"
"12909",1105294926,"This game I'm sure would've been popular back in 2012.  For 2018 the graphics are bad, the gameplay is very laggy & glitchy, no one is ever online in your server to play and when it freezes, even if you force quit it'll stay stuck in the same screen. The only way to fix a frozen screen is to delete and reinstall the app"
"12910",1105385887,"It was a nice game.  Not too hard, not too easy.  Just needed to be longer, or more levels."

"12912",1105385887,"Another great game by Sato! I love the unique graphics <3 the location is awesome and after you win its even more awesome! :3 sato's games are a treasure!"
"12913",1105390093,"I like all apps of this developer. Nicely designed and simple."
"12914",1105390093,"Beat the entire game in less than 2 hours, with no puzzle taking more than 5 minutes. Needs way more levels to be a good game."
"12915",1105390093,"Not very difficult, but some puzzle make you think.   Once I finished the last puzzle it jumped back to level one.  It would’ve been nice to see something at the end so I felt a little more accomplished about finishing all the puzzles."
"12916",1105408313,"It does get boring. But A M A Z I N G ! Is something I can say. The foods look amazing. And I’ll name 3 bad things and 3 good things   Good things:                           1. The food 🥘  2. The effort  3. The car!!!!   Bad things:  1. Glitching  2. The hotel room, one of them is a safari one that isn’t something a real guest would like to stay in 3. The bored 😐.

"12920",1105426659,"The game is very fun and addicting  The only thing i want is some skins for the girl or some other players."
"12921",1105426659,"So much fun!!! Getting coins isn’t some excruciating and tedious task like in some games. Good pace, bosses occasionally, and cool weapons. So. Much. Fun."

"12923",1105577194,"This game Is really fun EXEPT for the Ads... Even tho this is a game , it actually taught me some things of surviving in the wild! So Please rate this game ! And also , Please remove ads :D Thank you !                - A fellow rater"
"12924",1105577194,"I’m coming back to this game from a long time ago. Always loved it and still do. My only disappointment? I can’t move the positions of items in my base camp. It’s not essential, but it would give more reason and functionality to ‘viewing’ your camp, making it feel a little more personal."
"12925",1105584845,"Please add more to the game"
"12926",1105584845,"Challenging with appease to the short attention span"
"12927",1105584845,"This game is solid. One of my favorites. Will get you through boring times."
"12928",1105834924,"I really like this game and have played it a very long time. I’m at Level Pack 43, Level 1376. I’m solving levels that your app says only 0.99% of players are solving. My primary feedback is I wish you would make the levels more challenging. For example, I just finished Level 1375 which was Fish. Some of the words that solved it were “fin”, “gill”, “aquatic”. I mean come on! Surely, you can up the ante a bit and put in harder words like types of fish or names of fish species and use some lesser known fish. The game, at these levels should be more intellectually difficult as it progresses.  Additional Feedback: I understand you having to support yourself with ads. But could you please add the ability to silence them? It is EXTREMELY aggravating to start the game and have the ad start blasting its stupid music or whatever other noise it’s music."
"12929",1105834924,"The content of this game is really really good and addictive I love this game"

But it’s my favorite map in this game! I love the east passageway on the starboard side of the spaceship 💙. Also there is a way for the people behind the wall saying “No entry. Where full!” For the people to get to the other side! I lick and jump with the people.  I love secret swimming pool level! It is inside the 3rd and last turdis 💙.  I love the swindler goat! It can spawn over 9000000000 money  Boxs! 🤑 this is my favorite game ever! 2nd favorite is goat simulator classic because it is not in space. Also, Why do lots of games only make bug fixes in 2019 like Minecraft? I’m waiting for Minecraft to make a new mob in the game. I love 🐐’s.   -Nikolai r Kravchenko"

This is the 3 time this has happened, so I highly suggest that if you download this game don’t think that you will win, And if you want to win you will have to spend real life money."
"12940",1105928070,"We had a good time playing through this one. The ""capitol games"" were fun. Felt like this one is setting a lot of the story up for the rest of the books. Really interesting back story."

"12944",1105932165,"Can't believe this is the last book in the Pan series!! We have been playing Pan since the beginning and her adventures never get old. Well worth the price you pay upfront for a fantastic story experience for your kids. Hope there's more coming out soon!!!"
"12945",1105932165,"This app is so much fun, Suzanne and her team has done an amazing job once again! Kids can play this for hours and learn so much at the same time. I highly recommend all to download this app!"

"12949",1106002394,"I love mindless games!!"
"12950",1106002394,"Good, but why are the numbers weird? They have e’s in them instead of just saying million, billion etc. Also it doesn’t super fit the screen of an XR."
"12951",1106002394,"This isn’t a bad idle game if you don’t mind the political jokes and such.  My two big issues though are the amount of space it requires and battery usage. Currently it’s taking almost 2 gigs of space just for an idle game and that’s a bit ridiculous. No other idle games I have require NEARLY that much space. Also, this game loves sucking up battery.   If you guys can find a way to reduce space required and battery usage, I’d most likely rate this 4 or 5 stars, but until then, it’s staying a 3. It’s fun but only if you have the space and power to play it."
"12952",1106014973,"This is stupid it showed aclould and it lagged"
"12953",1106014973,"So yeah you need seven dollars for the whole game not trying to sound poor and I get you need to make money but still.Also another thing is u need to put in your username and password for your iTunes account so mine wouldn’t download so I tried on another device it downloaded but the first thing it did was crash"

"12955",1106057049,"Could changing from scene to scene be any slower? Playing this game is painful. I'm disgusted by the lack of quality in this product."
"12956",1106057049,"Good story, but this one hangs between scenes for 3-4 seconds. Very irritating. Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars as usual!  I'm really disappointed, as this is one of my ""automatically buy new releases"" series of games."
"12957",1106057049,"The game itself is fun but it has re started itself 3 times. So I've had to start from the beginning."
"12958",1106217529,"This type of games are easy to play, hard to master and makes you coming back everytime. The Ad's are a bit annoying, but you have the option to remove them. Just one final note: Please add more characters! 18 isn't enough!"
"12959",1106217529,"Fun game, should have named it ""DAMNIT""! Thinking about how to turn it into a drinking game."
"12960",1106217529,"It's alright. Not really something I would play non stop. It lags kind of but it could be cause my internet isn't good. I feel the cube moves a little too quickly but I understand why cause it gives a challenge."

"12966",1106493268,"First of all, I love tower defense games with real time combat, I’m also a sucker for retro style games and rockin’ chiptunes.  This game checks ALL those boxes, AND it has VERY solid gameplay!    So why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Because: 1) Items are WAY over priced in the in-game shop during gameplay 2)I thought Slayin “fame” points cost a lot, but it takes THOUSANDS of “soul” points to unlock anything!  4 characters is cool, but couldn’t there be more?  SUGGESTIONS: - Cloud support!  - Maybe a coin and/or soul point doubler in app purchase that can be “restored” on other devices.  I’d drop some real $$$ for that! -Lower the in-game shop prices!  Too expensive to upgrade character! -Add more characters like a “Paladin” or even “cleric” type character that can not only take tons of damage, but also heal.  A “Rifleman” distance attack character that uses firearms would be pretty rad too.  Anyway, definitely a very solid and well made game, but if some minor tweaks would be made, this would be a 5 star must play classic!"
"12967",1106510521,"The app is cute and easy to use for a child. You can either use your current location or enter a zip code. However, living in Arizona where it regularly gets over 100 degrees, it just shows ""1.."" for the temperature and not the actual temperature. Hopefully, that can be fixed because otherwise it is a good app and would get 5 stars."
"12968",1106510521,"This is a delightfully cute complement to the Freddy book series. The usually impossible task of picking an outfit in the morning has turned into a game the night before thanks to the 5-day ""Frogcast."" The memory game is another favorite -- gradually increasing the number of cards was a clever choice that helps build confidence before the more difficult later rounds."

As soon as i open the app the edge turn black and it glitches all my other apps into flipping when i turn to multi-tasking for some reason... (iPhone 4S iOS9).

"12982",1106831630,"I really enjoyed this game on pc and I’ve been playing this a lot lately but now it seems like every 30 minutes it’ll crash and honestly it gets old real quick. Would be great if all the hundred crash logs I send actually mean anything but I doubt it does. Seems Feral is more interested in newer games then keeping update their current games."

I hope for more titles and maybe one day multiplayer support to play with the mobile version with them on their phones. This is truly awesome runs great even on my iPad Pro. It’s great to have the kind of RTS gaming I like on mobile gaming. Please keep up the great work and hope to buy the other titles once they are out."

"12986",1107355213,"My favorite shmup is Crimzon Clover world ignition and this is very close to that action. I never thought it would be even slightly controllable in the touchscreen but it is.  Excellent game, fun upgrade tracks and I had no issues spending 99 cents for a new ship type."
"12987",1107355213,"Super dung game. It’s a tad bit complicating to get a grip on but once you do you feel like neo dodging all those bullets! Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to put some hours into it or someone looking for a casual game."
"12988",1107486943,"waiting for the release of this game for a long time. it is so fun, both the images and background music is funny. interesting game to play. the different image of もやし really shows the staffs spend time on hajime's video. Love this game!"

"12992",1107537631,"Especially not BAD Jazz.🎷🥁🥊  Which makes the opening suggestion of “Using Headphones”  a joke.🙉”....make it stop...”  The game itself is way too simplistic. And without any level difficulty or sound options  (other than turning off the volume)...I’ll pass.  📝  Instead of just the usual redundant updates,  why not add the level and sound options, and crank up the challenge..???  I’d be willing to try again. I’m all for second, at even third chances..... 😉"

"12996",1107704042,"I think this game would a lot of fun, but it will not let me unlock the other chapters. We have tried to purchase them, but it keeps saying “not allowed.” Can anybody help with this?"
"12997",1107741196,"The artwork and music in this game are breathtaking, as has been notes in many other places. I love many things about the gameplay, such as the well designed and creative abilities and synergies between the heroes. I played through the Mac version of the first game on the computer and I’m halfway through the second on mobile.  The reason for 4/5 is I keep finding myself wanting certains small changes for conveying information during combat (that wouldn’t change gameplay at all, but make it easier / more convenient to get all the information about what is happening). Specifically: 1) I mostly use the show all armor / strength display in the top right to get an overview of strong enemies still left on the field. It would be a really helpful thing to do something like add a red outline around the displayed armor / str of enemies to more easily sort through the information at a glance, when there are many units clumped together; currently the display is the same for your own units and enemies, making it quite confusing in the case of many units bunched together. This feels like such an obvious small touch that I’m surprised it’s missing given the attention to small details through the whole game as a whole.  2) The biggest lack I feel is the ability to quickly ascertain enemy turn order. In order to figure out the enemy’s turn order you have to click through each portrait, see where they are on the board, then use the clunky armor / str display to see how much damage the enemies can do etc. If there are more enemies than fit in the queue, tough luck. The game mechanics of this game are very similar to Into the Breach (the biggest difference being the fact that each side gets a turn with all their units in that other game) and I would love to have a button like Into the Breach does for a quick overview of enemy turn orders: when you press it, it shows numbers next to each enemy unit, 1 for the next enemy unit in the queue, 2 for the one after etc  Anyway, great job with the game! Even though I mostly focused on what I wish the game implemented, it’s still a work of art and wonderful design. It’s effective at creating a real atmosphere, and the ending of the first game made me cry :*) Perhaps someone has made mods to the pc version with my desired features, Imay have to look into that :)"
"12998",1107741196,"As a fan of Norse lore, this game really hits home with me.  Both a masterpiece of gameplay and storyline."
"12999",1107741196,"I enjoyed the game and don’t regret my purchase. The soundtrack, as with the first Banner Saga, is amazing. I continue to love the hand-drawn art and the unique setting. But the writing took a big step backward in the sequel. I was mostly satisfied with the content of the story, but the style of the writing was sometimes flippant, cheesy and generally much less mature than the first one. I’ll be purchasing the third as soon as it is released on iOS because I do feel attached to seeing how the story ends. But I hope the quality is back to the standards of the first one."
"13000",1107742773,"This game is great when you relive stress or just want a simple game to play."
"13001",1107742773,"Ridiculous videos and no character selection. Just a poorly executed rehash."
"13002",1107742773,"This game is really fun and addictive but it doesn't give you the option to change characters after you have already took the time to watch a video and get a character that you really liked.😞"
"13003",1107822876,"This game is fun and entertaining. Great way to unwind!"
"13004",1107822876,"Fun game!"
"13005",1107822876,"I downloaded this game yesterday when I was looking for a different cooking game. As I see, this game has good graphics and the game itself is quite entertaining and relaxing cause you don't have to think much. The drawbacks is the sound, it's kinda weird and loud but you can ignore it if the game operates well and you enjoy it"
"13006",1107880005,"Everytime I trying to hit the x to get out the out from the video i get send to the app store and is getting stupid"

"13008",1107880005,"Bought this day one and loved it. Then went free and I was given the tank for purchasing when it was a premium game. Reinstalled and no tank and no way to get it back. Please help"
"13009",1108185975,"I have enjoyed previous Adventures in this series; However, this offering has very little to recommend it.  Although the plot initially feels interesting enough, it quickly bogs down under its current own current, with repetitious HO's, stale puzzles, and mediocre graphics.  There is no map, leaving the hint button for all transport.  Placement of the tall lighthouse hint button causes frequent accidental striking of that area, as does the X on the top right of the screen, which is struck during zoom procedures.  The game feels old and stale, and I found myself looking forward to its end.  There is no lag between screens, and HO's are properly reactive to touch.  The game is moderately short, although it seems longer because of its insistence on getting multiple portions of items before they can be used.  Recommendation:  Pass, unless you are desperate to something while you watch your grass grow in the winter."
"13010",1108185975,"I liked the story but the games were somewhat boring. The game wasn't that long (paid version) but made up for it in bonus game. Also it was annoying to continue to get the adds and popups after i purchased the game for $6.99."
"13011",1108185975,"Game was ok, kind of tedious at times. I don't like this new trend of paying for the game upfront without getting to try it out first. Also, the prices have increased substantially. In this case, I didn't enjoy it enough to where I felt I got my money's worth. HOPs were really small to see, and you had to go into settings to see the interactive map, so that was an unnecessary extra step. Story was ok, gameplay fairly long, loads of HOPs if that's your jam. Overall, it felt like it was from a few years ago, could use some more development."
"13012",1108206682,"Wasting your time in ads & you can't get any fun"
"13013",1108206682,"Even after paying 2$ to remove the ad. The ads still appear like crazy. Also there is no option to restore purchases. DON'T BUY"
"13014",1108206682,"This game is easily one of the worst I've played. Nice graphics and cube models. But it has lots of ads and the timing on the jumps are terrible! How did this game go 4 version with this being fixed?!?!!"
"13015",1108340786,"It was fun at first, when it was relatively easy. But as you progress further on, it starts to become a game where you're just memorizing the track, since it goes to fast to comprehend the different objects."
"13016",1108340786,"Too easy"
"13017",1108340786,"My cousins can't get off my phone because of this game!! So addicting!"
"13018",1108384425,"this game is wack. Then you people gone put a “buy full version” as if the game was GOOD. I’m not satisfied. hmph"
"13019",1108384425,"So I was liking the game and like 10 minutes through it said I had to buy the full version to continue. So yeah it’s not a game it’s a trial."
"13020",1108384425,"This game is really great. I love the game. Can we get more levels though. It was so much fun and I want more levels."
"13021",1108417718,"Yes, you can make to level 3 on your own without paying to level up. however, that stupid out of time sound is the number one reason for the low rating. It is also the reason I won’t pay, too much obvious manipulation."
"13022",1108417718,"It’s a great game that’s well executed unfortunately I find myself chucking the phone on the couch next to me rather than playing. That’s because the levels quickly become frustrating with constant ball returns (slides that take the ball right back to where you flipped it from) and too little time to move forward. Combine that with tiny finger buttons that are easy to miss and flippers that don’t seems to always flip the ball in the direction you’d think they would and it can quickly become tedious when not advancing. It’s a perfect game to zone out to with the it’s melodic sound track but the gameplay doesn’t allow it. I suggest a setting embraces the fun of pinball without constantly being under the pressure of a clock. That and bigger butting areas. That would make this a five star game for me."
"13023",1108417718,"I love this game. I sit around my headphones on playing in the back of a Lyft Or standing in line at the bank end it anywhere I’ve got a moment and want to be in another world. Good job guys a really really original game!"
"13024",1108465034,"This makes it harder than it needs to be. I would rather solve puzzles than struggle to face the direction or thing I thought I was navigating to."
"13025",1108465034,"This was my least favorite game of all."
"13026",1108465034,"Very good challenge, plays well, no glitches, has a save, and ads are not intrusive.  The puzzle box under the telephone had me stumped..I hit on the solution at random after trying my logic (lol) several times.  No online walkthrough posted yet..I just kept at it and got lucky.  Hope to see more from this dev..thank you!"
"13027",1108475553,"This is how old my last review for this game was, the iPhone X has been out for over two years, and they have still not updated the game for the screen.   Please, fix this. It is such an amazing game, that deserves the bigger and better screen fit for it.   Edit 03/13/18 - I still love this game, but please update it for iPhone X screen. It hasn’t had an update in almost a year, please at least fix it for the iPhone X screen.   After finishing this game, I can say for certain it is amazing as a port on mobile.  I played it on my iPhone 7, and never had any issues with it.  The controls were actually the most surprising thing to me, as for a touch game they worked great! Most of the complaints I see for the controls stem from using the classic option. I wasn't a fan of it, and once I switched to expert, it felt amazingly smooth. I wish more games had this kind of flow for the controls, as most of why I couldn't put this game down was because of the controls being so surprisingly good.  If you want a great WRPG, that has meaningful choices through out, get this now!"

"13029",1108475553,"Seriously whoever decided that button presses on the attack/dodge/power attack buttons could also select a different target is a complete fool and should find a career in the liberal arts.

"13030",1108507977,"Fellow Former Big Fish gamers that wanted NewReleases, You are really Missing The Boat! Since we are No Longer getting New Releases for us IPad users, you need to go to the App Store and in search: Type in Hidden object games for IPad. The filter at the top left, then hit New Releases.   * There are several AWESOME Games NewFrom our friends at Elephant games. They offer a FREE Trial and are a 1 time unlock purchase price. Trust me - These games are OUTSTANDING! & WELL WORTH THE PRICE. Hope this helps - PLEASE CHECK THEM OUT, as a couple of us regular Dream Team gamers have worked VERY HARD at getting games for us IPAD users again.  As far as this game:  It was good as well, but as you know it is an Older game - Well worth playing. Big Fish, for those of you who haven’t realized it yet, we will be getting NO NEW RELEASES from Big Fish anymore!  This is a down right shame as we iPad users were all Very Loyal Supporters.  Your going to have to look elsewhere Now! Kdboots"
"13031",1108507977,"Enjoyable game! It’s a typical hidden object game with a cheesy plot, but it has an enjoyable story and well designed cutscenes. I love how it’s pay one time for the entire game because you can really immerse yourself in the puzzles."
"13032",1108507977,"UPDATE: For those of you who are going to this review site it is  November 10, 2018. If you are upset that BigFish is not giving us anymore new HOAG and re-releasing the old ones, try and contact me somehow. You can reach me at lynxminx @icloud.com. If anyone can get ahold of KimTwilight, it would help. BigFish will only release games with coins and energy and I won’t play those money draining games! We need a game plan, because there is a new CEO at BigFish and he is responsible for eradicating this entire genre. I hope someone sees this before BigFish or the App Store deletes my review. Reviewers pass along the info along with the way to reach me any way you can.  I have a couple of ideas. But I need help, someone who is tech savvy! Thanks everyone! DRACYY! I had to PAY 5 COINS FOR A MOUSE! A warning would have been appreciated, lol!  Anyway, this was a terrific game. You could customize settings. The graphics were totally magnificent. The game was decently long and had a long bonus chapter. This was my favorite type of game: a fairy tale, twisted as it might be! It was a cross between Rumpelstiltskin and Sleeping Beauty gone wrong. Loading was not quite instantaneous between  locations but the lag time was short. At each location you collect roses and morphing objects. There was no actual journal but objectives were regularly updated. Inventory was labeled and interactive and there were complex items to assemble. There was a marked, if so customized teleport map to transport you. The HO scenes had some variation. Luckily there wasn't an overabundance of them, because you didn't have an alternative. There were many puzzles and games. Some were fun and others were boring rotational stuff that I believe we are all tired of doing. Even so, this game was so gorgeous and fun to play that I didn't care about the puzzles so much.  The gimmick in this game was a wish box which helps you in exchange for drops of blood. It sounds morbid but really is not. It was fun because you learn more of the story and receive help in the game. I deducted a star for the following reasons: lack of a cohesive journal, small lag loading and also for the map to update itself, and too many rotational puzzles. However, all in all it was still an amazing game and I will play it again! It was magical, interesting and exquisite all at the same time. Lynxie sends 💋❤️😘 to Dracyy, KimTwilight, and the rest of the tireless and diligent DTE! Remember, our work is never done and the better our reviews, the better this genre gets! So thanks to all of you for your hard work!"
"13033",1108549870,"Easily my favorite game from you guys. Choices felt real and impactful while still managing to have a very compelling story. So many different story arcs that it’s definitely worth a few replays. Solid, solid work."
"13034",1108549870,"This is the first review I have ever whiten! And this is one the BEST game I have ever played! Sooooooo worth the five bucks! Please please please PLEASE make more of these!!!"
"13035",1108549870,"There were so many feels in this game and it has a bit of replay ability as well. The epilogue was pretty cool but I feel like I could of done better I wonder if I can get a bit further than last time or if it is fixed to end where it did. Anyways... I need a pirates 2!"
"13036",1108580508,"It’s so annoying I was about to beat my high score and there was an ad so I flipped out and deleted the app. rip. IF ANYONE DOWLOADS THIS APP THEY ARE INSANE AND IDIOTS"

"13039",1108623942,"I just started the game but so far it seems clever.  Not too hard but not too easy.  It's holding my interest.  Some interactive things I've not seem in other games. Refreshing!"

"13041",1108623942,"Highly recommend."
"13042",1108697438,"When I try to open/upload the first two “chill pack”’s, your app instantly closes...  Also, when I tried to click on the “Contact Us” option under settings, I get an error message, “This application didn’t configure UserVoice properly.”  I love the idea of your app, the sayings & the girls are cute, but it isn’t functioning properly.  :-("
"13043",1108697438,"I like this app and the boldness of the images, but there needs to be more."
"13044",1108697438,"It’s flirty, fun and a bit over the top! Best emojis ever for fun loving wome"
"13045",1108733742,"This app provides a very simple, clean, and enjoyable iPad environment for writing with Apple Pencil. It is incredible how close to writing on paper this is, even when writing in very small detail. I have 22 (twenty-two!) writing apps (notebook and sketching) on my iPad Pro and this is at least 10 times closer to writing on paper than any of them. Even the most popular note-taking apps do not interpret my handwriting like a physical notepad does (they often fail miserably). Note Always is amazing at making my writing look exactly as it would on paper.  I have only one request. I know this is a simple writing app, but if I could annotate PDFs on this, it would be absolutely perfect for me. Please, please add the feature to import PDFs. This would make it 5-stars!  Thank you for creating this gorgeous app."
"13046",1108733742,"I as a college student am trying to go paperless and I watched videos and reviews online and decided that this app coukd work really well, I paid like 15$ for it and the app is not worth it at all. I can see spending 5$ on it, but that’s about it. The app is not user friendly and doesn’t have a help button to allow for easy tips and tricks other than how to use the eraser. How do I get my money back?"
"13047",1108733742,"Great app just needs type support and zoom handwriting to be perfect in my opinion, a redesign of the main page where you see the folders and notebooks would make the app a lot more intuitive as well."
"13048",1108964305,"Cool game"
"13049",1108964305,"What’s the purpose of getting coins if you can’t use them to buy skins?"
"13050",1108964305,"This game has a great idea which is executed perfectly. The variety of characters make it hard to stop playing. This game is amazing, and it deserves to be more popular"
"13051",1109024890,"Levels were a little too easy and repetitive for me. Breezed through this but would be good for a younger audience."
"13052",1109024890,"Controls just feel awkward but I think that's just the curse of touch screen for me. There's a part in the end of 2-13 right before getting to the totem, where you have a timed challenge but the attack button covers up a rock that's in your way. It's not so bad in normal play but with a timed challenge it's a little awful. Game is not bad though"
"13053",1109024890,"Ignore the bad reviews the game is fun and quirky definitely worth the $ 😊"
"13054",1109425556,"There is no magic app that takes the place of hard work in an emersion setting. This one can supplement other tools available to motivated learners who don’t have the opportunity of living in Spain. Listen to good Spanish radio (hard to find but it’s out there) read books in Spanish, take classes and use apps like DuoLingo/Tinycards/Rosetta Stone. There are so many tools now that weren’t available 30 years ago. This one is just fine."
"13055",1109425556,"An option to hear the card each time it is presented when doing review would be helpful."
"13056",1109425556,"I was learning this and enjoyed it because there wasn’t a limit on mistakes like with Duolingo. But it wants me to have decks. No explanation about what decks are or how you are suppose to get them. So I guess I’m done."
"13057",1109444394,"I like this game. It's really really fun! But there's too many ads and i hate ads and its really addicting but still less ads 😒"
"13058",1109444394,"I love this game it's so fun and I could play it for hours. but I hate the newest update. I wish it was back to the original where it was always the bird as the player and always the ghosts flying across the screen /:"
"13059",1109444394,"I love the game"
"13060",1109489005,"In learning points of sail it shows PORT side to be on the RIGHT. Which is exactly opposite of what it should be. PORT side is on the LEFT!!! I want my money back."
"13061",1109489005,"Great app.  Helps me learn to sail better."
"13062",1109489005,"Love this app, great add-on to the basic keel boat course I’m taking right now.   The only thing I wish this app had was a sailboat terminology lesson. A 3D setup of a sailboat with a vocabulary word match game would be immensely helpful. Confused as to why this was left out because of how important it is. They recently updated the app so I have hope that it will continue to improve"
"13063",1109545844,"What a great storyline.  I read some other reviews about glitches but I didn’t experience any at all. The lag time between scenes WAS a little long however and my only other critique was that some of the shaded or darker areas in HOPs was too muted and I had to use hints to finish.  Best part? Seemed I played forEVER and I like getting my money’s worth!  Great story, great graphics and love that little Imp!"
"13064",1109545844,"I really enjoy this game, especially the little elf helper! I read that some people complained about scenes taking a long time to load but that’s probably due to their system. They do take a little longer to load but if it’s extraordinarily long, it’s your system and not the game."
"13065",1109545844,"iPad Pro - hard to keep track of the extra items and move to scenes where you can perform and action if the map won't open when selected."
"13066",1109674878,"今天更新过后突然玩不了了，一直显示“载入中…5%”就没有然后了。"

"13070",1109751921,"I’d skip it. The AI is knight heavy which Is annoying to battle.  And the boards are are are random enough that many are just not fun to me, but not ever random enough that you will nod you head and think... interesting."
"13071",1109751921,"I think the game would be a lot more fun if we could play with a friend. Also, even if the rank is under 50, the AI always has more bishops and knights than us, which are the best pieces in the game."
"13072",1109781792,"It's really meh. Is that the whole game? It's up to luck, skill has nothing to do with it"
"13073",1109781792,"It's a fun and addictive game that will keep you busy for hours!"
"13074",1109781792,"One of my favorite stages was the monster one also it's very unique and interesting"
"13075",1109788041,"It's so beautiful and relaxing. But you need more variety in shapes.  PLEASE ADD MORE VARIETY OF SHAPES PLEASE.  O I see what happens the shapes change the higher levels you pass. I think or I am losing my mind. I love how challenging this game is. It never gets boring. I love this game."

"13078",1110273623,"This music app didn’t know any of the trending songs when I looked them up to add them to my playlist! When I play a song it is always really glitchy. It also shows me way to many ads even when I do the survey thing to get rid of that ad it still comes back. I do not recommend this app if I could give it zero stars I would!"
"13079",1110273623,"Yo I love this app I would definitely recommend this app for music and I use it like all the time lol!!!"
"13080",1110273623,"I can only use this app on playlist at home only I can not use it outside elsewhere? It keeps giving me error"
"13081",1110368735,"But in a very good way :)"
"13082",1110368735,"Yes, This app is super addicting and can get a bit annoying at times when you can't complete a level.  Good game. Good soundtrack. Good environment and the most favourite Good concept guys well done😘 All sounds good! I wish there will be more game modes and endless modes to come. Keep up the good work. But ofcourse one suggestion, no game centre guys, need to think about it. Thanks"
"13083",1110368735,"This is by far one of the coolest games I have played on my iPad. The gameplay is pretty cool paired up with the simplistic tonic game music.i am hooked.it is good yeah. It's got challenging levels and damm interesting but levels get so difficult that sometimes you just want to crush the game but anyways from my perspective i liked the game good."
"13084",1110376793,"This game is gorgeous, user friendly, and a real pleasure and challenge to play. Hits all the right spots for me. However, there are no settings within the app so you cannot turn the sound off. I like playing games while commuting and listening to podcasts, and with this game you cannot listen to anything else while playing. That’s the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5."

"13090",1110447884,"This is my all time favorite series - and Wolfhill is the best one yet! (Which is really saying something)  The cause of the werewolf curse is finally revealed, and it's awesome. Druid magic and science makes for a bad combination...  Just buy it, you won't regret it, promise!"
"13091",1110447884,"Looks like an older game but i played games that are 3 years old that were better than this. Lackluster graphics, not the best puzzles and dumb story."
"13092",1110447884,"I really didn't care for this one, although for the money, I shouldn't complain.  Other ones in this series were much better.  This one seemed plain with fewer scenes and a lot of back and forth."
"13093",1110480334,"I wouldnt download this game unless you have went threw the whole app store and found nothing better to do with your life."
"13094",1110480334,"This game is so stupid"
"13095",1110480334,"So In the career game mode wrassle the character seems to be way more let’s say better than all the other characters which is wierd cause he’s not on top? Therefore he’s not the best?? So please fix that make him weaker or just put him on top ya know"

"13100",1110700363,"Thankyou for making this game"
"13101",1110700363,"Pretty fun. Sometimes takes a while to find the target."
"13102",1111311076,"This game took my breath away. There’s a sense of a fearless imagination behind this that’s amazing and exciting. Can’t wait to see what else she’s working on."
"13103",1111311076,"In this text-based RPG, you play as a combination firewall/fire elemental, protecting a few people and places from magical and technological threats. If you're like me, that's enough to try it out, and if you do you won't be disappointed.  It's short-ish and linear, but there are so many things to learn and try it has good replayability. I'm very looking forward to Open Sorcery 2."
"13104",1111311076,"A very fun and creative game, really enjoyed it."
"13105",1111420122,"I like the app, but my belly keeps hitting the chat feature or my hand. Is there a way to move the feature or make it available another way? Makes the app hard to use when it just wants to open chat."
"13106",1111420122,"Thought it would be a cool app. Pregnant with twins, now 26 weeks. I have fetal Doppler at home and know exactly where to find heartbeats for each one so I figured using this would be easy and something I could use away from home. Well i think it’s a waste. Cant find/hear either heartbeat and don’t have patience to try for an hour trying to hear something."
"13107",1111420122,"horrible app. you can barely hear your own heartbeat. just sounds like a broken old school tv."
"13108",1111504185,"This app/book version of Hawkins famous laymen book is just an amazing piece of learning. This makes much more accessible and understandable the complex and awesome topics dealt by Hawkings as he explains how our universe works. I am just in awe at how creative he is to produce one of a kind    e-book like this. The pace, illustrations and connections of topics within the book are so helpful and so appropriate for the new generation used to tweets and small bites of information. You can flip over some topics when you have some time, learn some amazing fact, and come back later which no rush or worry about how fast you are progressing through the book. Hope other books on complex topics are translated to this format. And I love the updates of the latest science since the publication of the original book. We have learned so much in the last decade that I agree with Hawkins, it is an honour to live in this times."
"13109",1111504185,"I figure if I'm going to get paid to use the bathroom at work, I may as well learn something. Great information in a very well designed app."

"13118",1111873503,"Extremely disappointed with this app. I cannot figure out how to copy and paste an emoji into my messenger or instagram. It wants me to “allow full access” but that includes potential my credit card information and home address. If there was a way to have my money refunded I would."

"13126",1112071930,"Nice game, good graphics, but......... There are game parameters that are difficult to work with.  Never really understood the “flavor” of individual origami warriors, never really understand the function of the glowing balls in matching, can’t figure out why some warriors have different effects when battling, and WORST of all is the short timed sections.  Why must every game be an exercise in fast button pushing?  And finally, there doesn’t seem to be any access to a support or app maker website or interaction mechanism.  So we end up making comments like this.  Makers:  1.  Eliminate the short timed sequences (level 35 is unwinnable!) 2.  Put in a rules/rationale/strategy page so we can understand what the special features mean 3. Create a website so questions can be asked/answered  I DO really like what has been created so far and would like to continue with it."

"13146",1112481571,"So cluttered.  You can't even use it.  SkyGuide isnwhaty friends had and it showed all the stars and planets in a very easy to see format.   This one is trying too hard to be all fancy."
"13147",1112532917,"Does not indicate in app purchases but immediately indicates 24 levels available for 1.99. Tedious.  Control is not as precise as it needs to be. In some cases the fans should be angled to improve control. How about being able to control the angle. Too much to hope for. The marbles themselves could have been a little more colorful. I found it tedious and then overly difficult. Deleted."

"13151",1112540727,"To all the people who hate this game,  Play the original game they made before this one. Tiki Taka soccer was a great game. The international version was something of DLC. It is fun, and exiting. It's not even that much faster than the old one. On Tiki Taka I had a striker named Straddle, absolute legend. He scored over one hundred goals in a season. Twice. He felt like he had the same speed as William. So, if anything they made the game feel slower. Maybe it was the higher camera, I don't know, but this is a great game no matter what."
"13152",1112540727,"The game is definitely tough but with a little practice it gets easier. The touch style of gameplay and draw to shoot/tackle is what makes it unique."
"13153",1112690545,"My daughter loved this game, but now she can’t seem to watch any videos on any of the GoldieBlox apps—did they move them to YouTube, or some other platform? Disappointed I paid for these and now she can’t access the content."

"13156",1112858566,"Hi I a number of concerns with this game. First being that the game is not free and locks after a couple turns. Secondly i bought a group package and after a couple of turns, the game is still locking, requesting I buy it again. I check to see if i have the group package and it says purchased. I check to buy the mode individually. On the picture it says .99¢ but once i click to purchase, it says $1.99. This feels both buggy or at least like a scam. Please fix."
"13157",1112858566,"I accidentally bought the thing for 5 bucks"
"13158",1112858566,"I don’t like this game because it had too many adds and I could barely play the game and after a certain amount of cards that I went through the purchase menu would pop up. And it kept popping up and I couldn’t play the game like I wanted to."
"13159",1112861301,"Hello I am deciding whether or not I should ask for a refund. This book is beautiful and I love the effects, however the main reason why I purchased this book was because I thought it had a click on the word and the book app would read it back to the reader, feature.

Thank you for your time and considerations. Have a good day."

It now registers my 440 tuning fork as about D#.  Apple recently admitted it slowed down older iphones, which they may have done to my iphone (through IOS updates I installed?) and caused the tuner to read about 3/4 what it should. If you are going to load this on an older iphone, perhaps the IOS ""updates"" will screw it up."
"13173",1113473319,"I looked at a dozen tuner apps. It came down to Boss and Fender.  I loaded both and tried them a couple times.  The Fender app didn’t like the low B string - couldn’t “hear” it well.  The Boss app performed well with all 6 bass strings!  The chromatic mode locked in quick to each pluck.   I turn my phone on it’s side and set it directly onto the amplifier face. This displays only the tuning graphics and they are large enough to read from floor level.  When using TU-3W (black) mode my phone remains discrete.   This is the next best option to an in-line tuner!"
"13174",1113603774,"Flip  line you did it again! Another amazing app! I saw these games on websites. Then when I downloaded them they were great! I love how you dress the character  up according to the holiday! The upgrades In the kitchen are Very helpful! I love making tacos 🌮 in real life and this is helping me practice! Thank you 😊 again! I plan on downloading many other flipline games!"
"13175",1113603774,"Another great game by flipline studios just purchased it today after playing it on the computer and I’m hooked !! Can’t wait to show my niece so she can get hooked too ! Please do bakeria next !!"
"13176",1113603774,"If you’re looking for a great cooking game, then don’t look any further. This game will put your memory and powers of concentration to the test. You get to serve delicious tacos and special recipes to a band of goofy and lovable customers. Decorate your restaurant and celebrate the holidays. Unlock yummy taco shells, meat, sauces, chips, dip and taco fillings.  There’s only one thing I don’t like about the game. Although you can earn stickers, they don’t do anything. They don’t grant bonuses or earn you any extra money to buy kitchen upgrades or decorations."
"13177",1113736426,"The notch at the top is hindering gameplay  Pls update to make the game end up to the notch"
"13178",1113736426,"For those like me that can remember loading up Corkscrew Follies onto the old desktop and pouring in the hours, finding this was quite a pleasant surprise. Gameplay has been formatted for the mobile experience but the navigation is practically the same. It can be cramped at times on a phone but it’s still playable. There’s only one aspect that I wish was included, and that’s the sandlot mode where you were free to design your own rides and parks with no restrictions. I can get past that though because this is much more than I ever expected from RCT on mobile."
"13179",1113736426,"I’m having issues with the sound on the app."
"13180",1113756219,"Super challenging and super addicting. Love this game!"
"13181",1113756219,"I broke my phone cause of this game"
"13182",1113756219,"I liked the game, it's just every couple times I died I would get another annoying  ad, if this app had no ads I would've rated 5 stars"
"13183",1113943452,"Please make some of your games free for limited time"
"13184",1113943452,"I downloaded this game today because it said it was free with App Gratis. The problem is, whenever I load the game, it said that the build has expired, and I need to upgrade. Then it gives me an OK button, but when you click the the OK button, that goes away. I have no idea how to upgrade, and I don't even know if I have the $.99 version of the game, or if I still have the free version, but it's very confusing as to what I'm supposed to do if I only have the free version instead of the promised paid version that is supposed to be  free. It doesn't say whether it's supposed to remove ads, or whether there are extra levels, or what the difference between the paid and free versions are."
"13185",1113943452,"Horrible JUTS HORRIBLE!!!!"
"13186",1114061571,"This keyboard isn't like others. It's a copy paste which doesn't work in notepad, text or Facebook. Frankly I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be able to paste these emojis to. Not worth the space on your phone."
"13187",1114061571,"I really love these cute emojis!! But why do I have to pay for all the new ones when I already paid for the app?? 🤔 hoping for a new update when full access.."
"13188",1114061571,"Loved this app. But already paid for it and now I have to pay for MORE? That's not fair!!!"
"13189",1114127463,"The text cuts off when in vertical mode, have to turn the phone horizontally to actually read the text"
"13190",1114127463,"Haven’t tried to play the game in months. Can’t get it past opening screen on iPhone XR. Support site in store doesn’t work. Game hasn’t been updated in 10 months. Not sure what the issue is."
"13191",1114127463,"Can’t be played in portrait on an iPad for some strange reason"
"13192",1114130722,"It's a fun little game. I've always liked platformers like this. The problem I have with this game is it's is somewhat glitchy. I often run into invisible walls and sometimes I get sunk into the ground. If you are jumping from the edge of a platform, it will not allow you to jump twice,  assuming that the jump was already on its second jump. In the 12th level, I keep getting stuck between the rail and the ground when I am riding in the rail cart... then I die and have to start the whole level over again.  Little things like that can ruin a game. I hope they improve this game, because I really do like it and it is worth a play through even with the glitches."
"13193",1114130722,"It's just my personal opinion but I enjoyed the first one more"
"13194",1114130722,"It's a really cool game it's like a game boy if you like old school games then you should get this game"
"13195",1114170869,"Played this game as a kid and loved it! Was really excited to play it again on my phone (iPhone XR), but there is no sound. Super bummed! Please fix so I can update my review."
"13196",1114170869,"This game was incredible as a kid and this app is flawless! If you are like me, then you want the original sound and graphics. This app delivers with both the original graphics and the updated graphics as options. I loved it and continue to enjoy it. Buy it now! You won’t regret it. :)  Developers: Please consider a part 2! Get the old cast together and see what new adventures you guys can come up with!"
"13197",1114170869,"Just downloaded and no sound."
"13198",1114261491,"Keeps one occupied and with the different game modes you can keep going without getting bored for some time."
"13199",1114261491,"Watch ads IS REQ'D to play trashcan mode, then good luck scoring what you need to unlock players in that mode. THAT IS LAME.   Other reqs for unlocking players is impossible.   Kick is always from same angle. Not realistic.   Same background/stadium. Gets old.   Needs more stats: AVG SCORE would be nice, total rounds played, total lifetime goals scored."
"13200",1114261491,"This game is really fun, I'm hooked"
"13201",1114483079,"DEAR GAAAHD allow for the music to be removed!!!!!"
"13202",1114483079,"Does not provide any strength or weakness information. This seems like it would be the most basic information that should be offered."
"13203",1114483079,"This app doesn't currently offer any information unique to Pokemon Go, nor does it look like there is space reserved for it. Shows basic type, weight, height, and evolutions, but not much more than that."
"13204",1114594263,"It's fun kinda addicting amazing gameplay and of course good job :) :) :)"
"13205",1114594263,"The game is outstanding. It would be one of the best dual sticks on ios if it was not for the controls. I play with a mfi controller and the only time if I have died was because the controls are jittery. My character will shake to the left or right which makes the game impossible in the later levels when there are many traps and you need precision. So I tried to play without my controller and for me it's unplayable, it becomes an entirely different game where you can only fire in 4 directions which makes it no longer a dual stick shooter. So if we can get the controls fixed this is 5 star game for sure. I want to die because I make a mistake, not because of the controls."
"13206",1114594263,"It good I just feel like it hard to move the characters"
"13207",1114606759,"It’s a really fun and entertaining game, love the idea and the game itself! But there are times where after reading an email when I would go to close the button doesn’t work, or.. any button! I started freaking out as the hunger and bill meter went down and there was nothing I could do! I thought this was the cause of pressing on the “click here you’re a winner” spam button in the shop. But even after deleting the game and re-downloading it, it still did the same thing! Please fix because I would love to keep playing! But the buttons not working is keeping me from downloading it again."
"13208",1114606759,"The game eventually stops responding to touch causing me to have to close the app and lose progress. This really stinks if you’re in the middle of a higher paying job because you will fail and then be stuck cleaning dishes or flipping burgers."
"13209",1114606759,"The games great, I love the idea, the mini games and the panic. My only thing is that sometimes things become unclickable or they just don’t respond. So I can panic and tap on the fridge but it doesn’t do anything, so I’d have to save and quit and then open up the save again to make it work.  Other than that, love the idea! Maybe more new added jobs while we’re at it?"
"13210",1114681193,"I think that every time u die u should have the same length as you did before"
"13211",1114681193,"It’s a good game but it’s too hard too many ads are you just still got really small don’t get it"
"13212",1114681193,"Hate it because I hate the creators"
"13213",1114692553,"It’s really fun and different from superhot vr but basically the same, and still really fun!"
"13214",1114692553,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"13215",1114692553,"Fantastic game, but the concept’s spoiled by a wall of death that chases you. Would gladly pay for a version without any time constraints."
"13216",1114710947,"Easy to use."
"13217",1114710947,"I don’t think so!"
"13218",1114710947,"Over all it is a great app but then again there isn’t much to do."
"13219",1114718412,"Could you not put the restart button right next to the continue button? Also, there is no reason for a single plant to be able to ruin your whole level."
"13220",1114718412,"I love the game"
"13221",1114718412,"Before i even install the game dubai's taxis are not like that fromthe pictures these are from ny which is new York. i havnt tested thr game yet as they said dont judge a book by its cover but i hope you see this message and share"
"13222",1114751883,"More game modes and tanks"

"13225",1114811228,"Awesome! Loved it! Need and update and more chapters ASAP!"
"13226",1114811228,"I loved the original game but this game was not my favorite, sure there is multiple endings but there is only one season and that's not worth the 4$ I paid for it so the only thing that I can say is that it is a waste of time and money ."
"13227",1114811228,"Good game but needs to be longer. Maybe three seasons?"
"13228",1114886979,"This game is awesome 👏 is the Best is the moment when you’re ready amp ❤️ ❤️ love it I’ll add it to my favorites"
"13229",1114886979,"This game I awesome I would give it a prize if I could of one of the best games ever and I have so grate ideas for more games 🤗😄☺️ Grate ideas for the game: Toca boca zoo, Toca boca Mansion/houses and city and departments whith school and a church to get mearid but can it be free please!!!!!!!!!!! if not my mom maybe she can’t buy it because you have to pay for it and I’m a really big fan of Toca boca so please be free and iwhant you listen Toca boca I’m so excited for this game I really love Toca boca and please do these games I’m stil an 8 year old"
"13230",1114886979,"Okay toca boca I love your games. But some people argue the expense of them. When I bought this vacation game, I didn’t really like it. But then I thought something. Since I don’t have all the toca life games, I thought if you didn’t like a game, you could return it and get a different game for free. So it’s technically swapping out different games for the want you want and actually like. But, if you want to get more money, you can give all the gamers 1 return and they can purchase more. Thanks so much toca boca! I really appreciate it! :D But, it would be wonderful too if you delete a game that costs money, you can maybe get your money back? You don’t have to do that tho. Thanks again! :3"
"13231",1114893521,"Please add the flash"
"13232",1114893521,"When the notification says get 500 coins for playing, this is the 3rd or 4th time and I've open that notification and no coins were received. Don't lie to make me play a game."
"13233",1114893521,"It's co0l I guess"
"13234",1115010672,"The ad frequency is absolutely horrendous. You get through 30 seconds of puzzle work and are interrupted by a 25 second ad. They don’t even wait for you to complete the puzzle. It’s far from calming or relaxing.  The puzzles themselves are actually enjoyable, but it’s not worth the download until they limit the disruptions."
"13235",1115010672,"I’d pay some money for no ads. Let me know if that ever happens. Until then, uninstalled."
"13236",1115010672,"Beautiful and addictive!  Love it!"
"13237",1115022026,"I absolutely love this app! It really does work. However once your checks get to $200K it stays at $200K every single day thereafter even once you’ve spent the entire check. The whole purpose of this app is to get the user into the mindset of receiving and spending large amounts of money. I would like to see the checks continue to grow with each day. Other than that this app is wonderful!"
"13238",1115022026,"I accepted update 2 days ago. Now nothing, and I mean nothing works   Where is the next update? It came within 2 days and helped a lot. It’s still slower than it was, and glitches sometimes.   But, overall I have to thank the developers for being very responsive and trying to get it working for everyone again.   I use this every morning and, who knows, maybe the universe is just telling me to slow down. 😎"
"13239",1115022026,"i’m only writing this review in hopes that the developer could help. my app was fine until i updated it yesterday. now i can’t use the decimal button when writing in my manifested money, and anything below $1 is shown as $0. would be great if i could get some answers thanks!"
"13240",1115245945,"Fun problem solving game. Really enjoyed."
"13241",1115245945,"It is very entertaining so far in Level 1."
"13242",1115245945,"Very cool game"
"13243",1115249449,"Mine seems to be crashing quite often resulting in me losing & there’s nothing I can do about it. Aside from that, it’s pretty fun :)"
"13244",1115249449,"You’re gonna love this game. It never gets old. Plenty of content. Love that it’s timed and love that it’s a continuous challenge between opponents. I can literally play this game all night long!!!"
"13245",1115249449,"Why is the app having synchronization problems?! I can’t play at all!"
"13246",1115415865,"There’s an earthquake! Well I love this app. Bye!"
"13247",1115415865,"This is the first by Tinybop app I gotten and it is just amazing! There is nothing wrong with the game. I love your games so much. There are so much possibilities with the skyscrapers."
"13248",1115415865,"I thought this game would be fun after reading the reviews... After about 10 minutes I got super bored because you can do anything. 🙄"
"13249",1115633942,"Ive played the first three games on my Iphone 4S. So that gives you an idea how successful these puzzles are. Each started out on its own before Memento, then they hid Gems in each of the levels (+ series). There’s also Red Portals that take you to a Secret timekeeper level in Memento.  One of the additions here in ZEN is: One way portal blocks which you come out of the direction the Gold ring sent you.  You can’t go back through a block however you can move it to a new place you want to send stuff in or teleport out of! The SWEET part lies in certain levels you can actually PUSH the block into the Gold Ring that creates & leads to a WORMHOLE level. Everything move you make there is now REVERSED!   If you never played any of the Quell series before, you can start with the original to see where the game gets better over time. So if you haven’t got the package of 4 - try Memento first.  The original might drive you a bit MAD as there’s less variety of puzzles there & more use of closing gates. However, both original & Reflect each have BONUS levels for extreme challenge too."
"13250",1115633942,"Dear Fallen Tree Game Makers, I love the Quell games so so much!!! Please consider adding the following updates to all Quell games: ability to reset apps to fresh, erase memory without erasing prior purchases, tips for how to solve/reach very tricky locations for gems and portals whether for purchase or through a link to a blog about the games and how they are designed. I love Quell games so much that I want to go Behind the Quell! I want to know the designers, what inspired their choices, the colors, the music, etc. Thank you so much for making these games for us to enjoy!!!"
"13251",1115633942,"The Quell series is a significant work of art on all levels. Compelling, comforting, challenging, inspiring.. I would love to have the option to move through chapters at the same level of difficulty as the first level, when I want a purely relaxing experience. As with Memento, I found some of the puzzles too complex to tackle. That said, I'm always looking forward to experiencing more Quell, and I'm grateful that I can turn to these gems that fill my heart."
"13252",1115647211,"It pastes like a big image it's not a real emoji"
"13253",1115647211,"The app is working great! The emojis are just right and they work better as stickers for iMessage. We can communicate better 👌🏻👌🏻🙌🏻"
"13254",1115647211,"1. When you click the image it doesn't go into wherever you're typing like an emoji should  2. It just ""copies"" then image which, when pasted, is just a string of numbers.   Dev, please help me out or send me my $1 back."
"13255",1115681877,"Stupid app"
"13256",1115681877,"Don’t buy this app it is a complete scam!!!!!!!!!! It says to give it a five star rating but that was a lie!!!!!!!!!!!"
"13257",1115681877,"3:5"
"13258",1115911787,"Good game and you never give me the coins"
"13259",1115911787,"Awesome games really enjoy"
"13260",1115911787,"I Love this slot game."
"13261",1115981170,"I need to change the language to English too TT^TT how to change??"
"13262",1115981170,"How can I change the language to english"
"13263",1115981170,"本当に楽しいです！"
"13264",1116025351,"I love this game but I don't like how you unlock all the areas and then you don't have anything else to update. Also, I want you to add packages.You could put the food in the box and tape it up and then put it in the truck and drive it to a house or something.( but you could also just sell it at the market)  Also, you could add more food like corn, tomato soup where you smash the tomatoes and poor them in a can  I also think you should add an app.You could take a character and dress it up , give it a bath and put it to sleep and give it breakfast.And then in the morning you can take it to work as a farmer ."
"13265",1116025351,"Dr Panda is definitely a fun game for suitable for children as young as 3 -although some young children may need some assistance unlocking each of the different production areas.   Additionally, the app does offer a game environment which is supportive for a young child conceptual development of certain science and early math frameworks.   However, it is important to note, the ""core"" of the Dr Panda is that of entertainment and not of education.  This does not mean Dr Panda is not or could not be used in a constructive manner to promote learning.   Indeed, Dr Panda can be used to promote a child early understanding of addition and subtraction facts 0-5; especially when  a parent or other adult plays with the child and encourages he/she to think more deeply with questions/ statements such as: I see you have 2 customers wanting honey, but you can only make 5 jars of honey at a time. How many jars will you have left, after you give 2 jars to your customers.   This type of dialogue between caregiver and child will not only triple the boost to a child's educational skills; it will open the door for the child's understanding in many other cognitive domains.  Final Thoughts: Since gameplay throughout the farm requires precise fine motor skills - most beneficial for young children who are learning to write- I would encourage children to occasionally play this app using a stylus.   As these pre-writers work to twirl the windmill and place eggs in a carton, they will be developing the same muscles needed to write letters and words."
"13266",1116025351,"Omg dr panda games are one of my favorites and I'm 11. But I really wish there were more things to unlock. Like shearing sheep.or plowing the land and planting other seeds.Again I really like this game and you don't have to take my ideas, by the way my favorite selection is the jelly. Very creative pls make and update, bye😍"
"13267",1116026071,"Hi I am 10 years old I just wanted to tell you how much fun I am having with this app !  I am new to this app and didn’t get this until  yesterday . But this has been the best app ever!!! I am loving this app so much that l am not playing with any of my others !! My favorite part about this app is that you have to unlock all the different buildings. Thank you for creating this app. It is the best !  Your Friend            Claire 😜"
"13268",1116026071,"This app is awesome. You can use it without WiFi which I love, and it has so many fun secrets. It is so cute and interesting, and has great animations. Perfect app"
"13269",1116026071,"You should get it I love it and I can see why people like it and I don’t even want to know why they don’t like it"
"13270",1116027365,"Hi! Just as of right now there is a server unavailable glitch when I try to log in as a guest. If anyone can tell me how to solve this issue it would be great! Love your game and can’t wait to play it once again when this glitch is over."
"13271",1116027365,"Okay so, I’m not new to Mystic Messenger itself. I’ve wanted to get it for a while now, and here we are. But I’ve come across a very frustrating problem. I'm not sure if I just didn't catch the memo for this. Okay so, I accidentally fell asleep last night waiting for my phone to charge. I know the times of the chat rooms so, I paniced this morning figuring I'd just have to pay hour glasses to participate. I logged on and I'd already missed two chat rooms. But when I payed to participate it took the hourglass and didn't let me even look at the chat room. On top of that I can't open the one that's supposed to be the most recent chat room.   Help me T^T"
"13272",1116027365,"God . Finally , I know how to love :)"
"13273",1116112829,"Why do they all cost money! There is only 1 free one and I’m not allowed to spend money. So please in the next update make a couple free packs and get them for free by watching adds"
"13274",1116112829,"Cool concept but controls to customize the scenes are weak. Positioning capability of effect is very limited and the second part of the effects start before the shot scanges so there are timing issue there but overall it is a fun little gag tool but not useful for anything serious."
"13275",1116112829,"It’s great but the magic powers or whatever I really want the power up one better and free cuz my sister won’t buy it for me I want you please to make all powers free please I really want to try out all the new stuff in the app ):"
"13276",1116164772,"The game is thee best but there is somethings i want you to add it first of all i need the character to be circle not square.🤦🏻‍♂️ and i want to add the other characters in diep.io please and yeah thats i hope you do it :D! If do it i will give the game five stars! 🌟 thank you creator for creating this game hava a nice day! :)"
"13277",1116164772,"I liked how it was"
"13278",1116164772,"Not balanced and a bad game"
"13279",1116215882,"OK you can’t play as bubbles because she is the hacker and just because you’re a boy doesn’t mean you shouldn’t watch the Powerpuff Girls"
"13280",1116215882,"Would be a favorite game if no adds please take them away and I will play"
"13281",1116215882,"I hate the ads, but it’s okay. I like the game. It’s fun, and not too hard.   It’s waaaay better than the PPG reboot show.   Miss the original PPG though.  Anyway, nice job with this game, CN.  Can you please add Courage the Cowardly Dog Games for the iOS? Also, other CN classic shows as games."
"13282",1116249582,"Lots of great puzzles and an interesting back story with beautiful graphics..."
"13283",1116249582,"Okay, so I like them a little creepy and this is just that—a little creepy. The story is fun, completely without fairies and magic, just a little paranormal with a helpful ghost. The puzzles are varied in both type and difficulty with more simple ones than brain busters. In all, a fun way to spend a rainy afternoon."
"13284",1116249582,"I really enjoyed this game and the storyline kept me engaged. My only wish is that it was longer."
"13285",1116253995,"I love all of the Dark Romance series"
"13286",1116253995,"Pretty good game!"
"13287",1116253995,"This game needs a little bit more of a challenge but since I dead to play two different roles it made the game even more fun. We need more games like this one!!...."
"13288",1116271098,"6/20/18  Playing this a second time in 2018 and the game is even better. All glitchy issues I had with it initially are gone. This is at present a very smooth, stunning game. Well done! ********** Whoa. A stunning mid-2016 game. It's a delight to encounter the new generation HOPs when they are like this one. At this writing, 5 excellent reviews stand before me, and I can't add one note to theirs other than to share my agreement, but mention one perturbing issue--an odd full screen error message pops up whenever I activate the hint button. It ends with stating ""Don't panic."" I plan to see if this can be corrected by rebooting my iPad 2. Hopefully, it's not a glitch that will affect others, but it's rather annoying to me. I'll edit my review if the error message disappears."
"13289",1116271098,"BORING! Not always sequential. A waste of time and money."
"13290",1116271098,"It's hard to know where to go next most of the time, & if it weren't for the hint button I couldn't get anywhere.  However, the mini games are pretty good.  Not the same ol' same ol'.  But I miss the diary which keeps you up on the backstory.  Big Fish is a good game maker, so I'll stick w/'em for a while longer!"
"13291",1116329647,"Its really fun but it gets harder so good luck if you get it I gave it three stars."
"13292",1116329647,"This game is not good but it is not bad I still like it"
"13293",1116329647,"This game is plain garbage, this company is just desperate for money, so they put loads of ads. Which effect the kickoff because during the ad the game is going on"
"13294",1116494563,"Great game! Kind of hard but really fun! 5 stars!"
"13295",1116494563,"It's very addicting but if you hit anything it's game over."
"13296",1116494563,"I like how when you hit the oil spills you can still play but just have to try hard to control your self! But wen you crash before the starting line you have to start over and that bugs me😡! But I love this game super addicting! Makes flappy bird seem easy! Hard but easy once u play for a while!😄"
"13297",1116536171,"This is literally the worst game ever like when I dab the globglogabgalab come and starts singing all star with Robbie rotten(R.I.P.) and it gave me cancer in my eyeholes like omg and crash bndcot started wohing in my lol face, I rate it 1 out of 5 stars"
"13298",1116536171,"I am a member of the dab police and I had this game and deleted it because I got bored and I joined the dab police. This game is basically a Mario cover-up. I HATE DABBING😡👎! Do the right thing, Join the D.A.B. police today!"
"13299",1116536171,"I’m very impressed by the games graphics. It’s fun and life changing game to play. I definitely will be keeping this app forever. Splendid job creators👍🏼"
"13300",1116549013,"I just got the app and I do not like it 😡😒"
"13301",1116549013,"This is app is terrible and that's the tea"
"13302",1116549013,"This is one of the best app /face filter yet it's smooth no glitches and nice filters great app"
"13303",1116549578,"I’m reviewing to request an English translation if possible...I really love The Sweet Shop Rose and I want to play more games like it!   The art in this game is very beautiful and looks just as fun.   Thank you. ( ^ω^ )"
"13304",1116549578,"Will it have the Chinese version?"
"13305",1116549578,NA
"13306",1116609570,"Well I love doing hair  but I want more stuff I don’t want to pay 💰 10 bucks for the plazas please consider no adds and you don’t have to pay money so you should get the game it is fun so I’m guess you will like it thank you for listening to me."
"13307",1116609570,"I love this game"
"13308",1116609570,"This is a cool game I love it it makes me smile I love to dress up"
"13309",1116785618,"Love this addictive game. Does not requier to much thought. Perfect passtime."
"13310",1116785618,"I love it"
"13311",1116785618,"LOVE Piggy!  A real challenge!"
"13312",1116808304,"What a great game. Feels like Stranger Things meets Tron meets Halt and Catch Fire.  Just get it!  I couldn’t put it down, stayed up all night until I finished it. Worth every penny."
"13313",1116808304,"It’s very relaxing to play this interactive puzzle, moody, cyberpunk type, bit chaser game. Not sure if you could use just one word to describe it, so that was my feeble attempt.  One quick observation, the days seem to be wrong... maybe on purpose? For example, June 30th, 2359 is described as a Monday in-game, and Google tags it at Tuesday. Noticed that at the beginning date as well (can’t remember the specific day, but in-game date said Monday, calendar search had it as Tuesday). Haven’t gotten far enough, so maybe this will be explained later in the story?"
"13314",1116808304,"This, Frost, and Linelight are masterpieces. They’re never leaving my phone. Semidome, thank you for this gem. I only ask for more levels in the future but I know that’s a stretch. What’s here can be played over and over with great enjoyment. Support this amazing game, people!"
"13315",1116902833,"I love the app but since you guys updated the app it’s having issues starting up when I press the app I just get black screen and crash. Please fix it"
"13316",1116902833,"I updated the app and it keeps on crashing"
"13317",1116902833,"Every time I open the app it keeps crashing, it pops up on the unity logo turns black then crashes"
"13318",1116910957,"So I love this game, it’s amazingly addictive. However, one day, I ran out of hints, I tried to buy 5 more for $.99, but I never got the hints. I kept trying, but I got the same result. Otherwise, it’s a great game!"
"13319",1116910957,"0 clues, told I could Restore. Could not. Was halfway through game. Have quit. Recommend no one buy clues!"
"13320",1116910957,"Update!  Make sure you exit the program and then restart.  Once the sync of your profile is there from the web, my character says “inf” for clues.  Like others. Purchased unlimited clues. App says purchased. Never advanced from the initial 10 and keeps wanting to recharge me. Theft!"
"13321",1116980952,"This game is fun, and I would give it a higher rating were it not for the fact that a storm hits literally every five minutes in my game and damages a building every single time. As I type this I have 3 repairs ongoing and just finished a couple. Cut back on the damage, there can be storms that don’t damage your buildings."
"13322",1116980952,"Lots of fun, very addictive! I play in all my spare time!"
"13323",1116980952,"Without spending real $, can be alittle slow.  But a great game. Need constant attention or a storm will destroy what you have built."
"13324",1117166919,"I almost didn’t even buy this game. I was very wrong to second guess myself.   Restarts very quickly after you die. You learn from your mistakes and quickly see how the level can be beat. To be fair, most of the game I had fewer than 10 deaths per level. It jumped up in the second section to fewer than 20. In the final 25 levels, I averaged around 50, and even hit over 200 deaths on level 30 of the final section (each section has 41 levels). It gets really tough, but practice makes perfect. It makes it incredibly satisfying to beat. I probably won’t go back and play marathon mode, but it was easily worth the price."
"13325",1117166919,"This is a fantastic challenging game. I ask the devs to consider just one thing. Option to switch left and right tap controls. Some might might prefer the controls switched. I do. My right thumb would be better at maintaining the continuous tapping that would be required to fly while maintaining specific lift height. My left thumb doesn't have the stamina and loses control. Just a suggestion.   BTW The review claiming the game doesn't auto rotate is strange. The screen rotates just fine on my ipad and iPhone. It always flips immediately without lag every time."
"13326",1117166919,"Don’t waste your time and your money with this game"
"13327",1117310816,"It's quite a sassy little game and it's fun. Great graphics and they are nice and crisp with cute characters."
"13328",1117310816,"I'm having fun love tasha"
"13329",1117310816,"Great game"
"13330",1117365978,"NEEDS MORE PARTS AND LEVELS"
"13331",1117365978,"What happened to lego city my city?"
"13332",1117365978,"This game is so fun you can go on missions and explore so much fun love it rate 5 star"
"13333",1117405948,"I love this game so much!"
"13334",1117405948,"I love it! I love how you can play on your own somtimes and this is the best app my sis loves it too you made this happen and your are super awesome and I love your game!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💝"
"13335",1117405948,"Haven't been able to install the latest update...constantly fails...no way to trouble shoot errors"
"13336",1117621317,"I love this game so much"
"13337",1117621317,"This game is always acting up! When ever u go into the app it always shows an add and never shows the X!"
"13338",1117621317,"Something is wrong with your game and I’m in the MIDDLE of playing and an ad pops up and I cannot close it the game would be better if you fix this problem"
"13339",1117719909,"The best game is good pizza great pizza it’s awesome best game ever but funny face is good and bad I give it one star"
"13340",1117719909,"This app is pretty stupid it doesn’t look that’s really and it makes you just look really weird. If I’m being honest the quality could be a lot better. Overall Snapchat is a lot better."
"13341",1117719909,"I like this app because well I can send my photos to my family and friends🤳🏼👯‍♀️👯‍♂️👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👍"
"13342",1117844680,"It’s like, the best iPhone game but, a bit too hard"
"13343",1117844680,"Pretty good game all together but could need some updates, and new worlds but pretty good game p.s. beat my high score it is 101"
"13344",1117844680,"My high is 29. This is an awesome game not counting how you can't ever go under the drones. Five stars"
"13345",1117905680,"it is so much fun and i can play it all day long"
"13346",1117905680,"Can't actually play because of ads"
"13347",1117905680,"I love dis gaym"
"13348",1117998129,"Worth the pay!! It’s amazing how you’re able to see all the details of the human body and they’re all named as well!! Super cool. Especially for those who really need this app such as kinesiology majors!!"
"13349",1117998129,"What I was looking for"
"13350",1117998129,"This app is extremely helpful when studying Anatomy. With any book you are using to study you can always cross reference with this app and get a better understanding on where things are in the body. Well worth the money!"
"13351",1118072618,"Sounds very close to the original. The updated GUI makes editing way easier than the original and VST. Hopefully the VST version will get this interface eventually."
"13352",1118072618,"Love all the korg synth app products , was enjoying this one as well  till it stopped sending any audio out , I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it to no avail. Tried to look up any remedies online from Korg but nothing was there to help ."
"13353",1118072618,"I have been making the journey from analog to digital synths and in my foray into the land of FM Synthesis I discovered a little Korg box that nails that DX technology that in turn led me towards this incredible synth. This iWAVEStATION is a godsend!! Thanks, Korg, for bringing it back to us in this form. I hope to see the iM1 available for iPhone too."
"13354",1118082679,"This game is great. The insults are hilarious or ridiculous, and the controls work well. The only problem I have with this is that multiplayer just doesn’t work. I played with someone one time, and now, no matter how long I wait, there is no one available. That makes serious Sam and that other guy impossible to unlock! That’s not fair. I’ll rate 4 stars because this game is addictive, but I’ll only rate 5 if multiplayer is fixed.  Also, I wish there was DLC for the game so that you could get more characters or maps.  Thanks!"
"13355",1118082679,"I don’t know how to unlock the other things in the game, but I still love it!"
"13356",1118082679,"At first I thought this game was kid friendly but is actually inappropriate"
"13357",1118247592,"I love the game but I wish that we could like make deserts or something you know? But besides that I love it!😁❤️"
"13358",1118247592,"It’s good"
"13359",1118247592,"This app is so fun I love this game🤩🥳😎😍😍😍😍😍🤣🤣🤣😇😇😇😇😇😇😊😊😊😀😀😃😃😃😄😄😅😁"
"13360",1118353232,"Question for dev - if my shield is blown up/lost on a level, is there still any way to defeat the immovable turtle, since hookshot only pulls me toward him?  Good game - thanks."
"13361",1118353232,"This is my favorite mobile game ever. It’s challenging and engaging and years after starting I still play it nearly every day. It’s incredibly difficult sometimes, but that also means it’s incredibly rewarding when you come to understand it. But even after you get really good at it, it never stops being a challenge. I love that there are no in-app purchases or ads. Just straightforward play."
"13362",1118353232,"Challenging tactics game with fun abilities, environmental use, and enemies that work together well. Each combination of enemy types creates a different challenge. Targeting controls are imprecise and the UI doesn't show targeting clearly, so it's easy to accidentally move or attack unintentional locations. Perhaps a target confirmation tap will fix the problem."
"13363",1118398079,"This game offers cross platform play, but won’t allow you to use the same account on Steam and iOS. Also is not full screen on my device. What a waste of money."
"13364",1118398079,"Don't waste your money!"
"13365",1118398079,"This game is a lot of fun but it refuses to let me log on, which is extremely frustrating when I'm trying to play it with friends."
"13366",1118406919,"Good"
"13367",1118406919,"Love the game but Not to happy with customer service at the moment. I’ve been trying to contact you through the Wordalot app and your website but my emails are rejected as spam!  So silly as I’m not a business ...just trying to ask a question.  Wanting to know if when I purchase the no ads option with coins is it permanent or does it expire when the coins run out?  Does anyone know?"
"13368",1118406919,"Enjoyed the words and keep up your brain work!"
"13369",1118431695,"This game is the best"
"13370",1118431695,"Good game I love it"
"13371",1118431695,"cool game"
"13372",1118441024,"This game blasts me back to my childhood. Its so reminiscent of Bloons Super Monkey 1 and its got a great feel to it. I love that everything can be done without paying any real money. Its a fantastic game"
"13373",1118441024,"I got to ice map and defeated 4 bosses and got a epic weapon the catapult dart machine"
"13374",1118441024,"Compared to other apps this game has minimal ads and give you rewards that are pretty equal to effort. Not too time wasting. But being in the lower levels means things are most likely going to change!"
"13375",1118646945,"Just purchased for watch. Can’t open. $9.99 wasted."
"13376",1118646945,"I am not the only person who has been scammed by the developers of this app. If you make any in-app purchases, the features will NOT unlock. I did research on the app’s website and expected it to be trustworthy— it was well organized and informative. The website does NOT allow you to contact them. I have been TRYING to get a refund but apple support can’t help me and there is NO response from the developers."
"13377",1118646945,"I bought the premium package for a year & when it renewed the app never recognized my purchase, so I could not create new codes. Then support could not help me get back in - even after giving me a token for it. Now the app just crashes on my iPhone whenever I try to open it. Using LastPass now—wish I could get into PinGenie to pull out old passwords."
"13378",1118676232,"I accidentally got the game but I really don’t want it didn’t know it was money can you help me"
"13379",1118676232,"Power ideas Clone Water Grabbing the ground  Tornado flight  Costume ideas A shoulder stuff to attach like war machine gun, wings, etc More items on the back like a shelf shield etc  More stuff in general  Mis idea When you kill someone in game with the telekinesis power the name is gray  I love this game it's great"
"13380",1118676232,"Hey MDickie! I’ve been reviewing a few of your limited edition games and for this specific one I’ve been thinking why there’s no wings for a Superhuman? Add Crimes, Money system and a outfit store for super humans by the bar"
"13381",1118756851,"Trash"
"13382",1118756851,"This game is fun and challenging. The hardest part is when you begin a game and an ad pops up that fills the entire screen. Then you have to push the tiny x before you die. Hardest level ever! (In case the sarcasm didn't come through, this is a problem. Please fix it.)"
"13383",1118756851,"This is a really cool game but you should be able to vs. your friends and their are too many ads popping up all of the time"
"13384",1118803687,"I enjoy playing this game a lot"
"13385",1118803687,"Best game ever! Entertaining!"
"13386",1118803687,"Cute graphics"
"13387",1118844179,"Yeah I love your this app!"
"13388",1118844179,"Probably the worst game on the App Store. The game always glitches and freezes. It’s not fun, there’s too many ads, there’s no point to the game, and it’s just so repetitive. You end up doing the lame boring things over and over again with no real goal. The developer so be ashamed for their self for making such an awful game, and should stop developing apps all together. There’s a reason why no one has ever heard of this game and it should stay that way."
"13389",1118844179,"Trash game, trash graphics"
"13390",1118878857,"So I loved this game and I was good at it but I hadn’t played in years due to personal reasons. So I though “Why not try it out” And a thingy showed up and I read it...IT WANTS MY DEVICES LOCATION??? Ok so um...yeah no...I’m not giving my devices information, my devices location, or any other shenanigans...sorry but no...It’s not happening. Pleaseee help meeeee!"
"13391",1118878857,"Not competitive if everyone can get a box, plus sliding is dumb and that slam is dumb"
"13392",1118878857,"I love this game this game is so much fun it helps me com down and more but I just wanna say thank YOU!!"
"13393",1119002115,"I found out about this app about three hours ago and I was fascinated I had to try it and it has been great thanks guys you’re doing a wonderful job"
"13394",1119002115,"Content is very basic."
"13395",1119002115,"The previous version was much better. It was much more linear and you can track your progress easily. This version lost linearity and let you just jump right into any sort of training, and broke a lot of its appeal in doing so. If you do follow it, the app does help you to an extent, each person will have a different experience. I have had more success with the previous version than I did with this one. Also, upgrading logs you out and they didn't happen to save my progress from the original which was off putting. The latest update is broken too where the keyboard doesn't go away/no enter key, and progress sometimes doesn't record. This version makes you play the doctors videos every time you start training, you can skip it, but in the previous version, the app already knows you've watched it. You would think that after all of the media attention this app got, that they would improve the app, not make it worse."
"13396",1119003636,"Don’t bother. Too expensive for very little."
"13397",1119003636,"I love this app it’s soo cool and you can text with it😋😆😁😄😃😀"
"13398",1119003636,"I have an iPhone 6s and I go in the app and than I pick my gender than it crashes and goes to the home page I tried everything and it still won’t work it looks like so music fun but I can access it."
"13399",1119104329,"Paid for this app yesterday and it has been crashing.  We shut the iPad off and restart the game, only to have it crash moments later. I want a refund!"
"13400",1119104329,"I never tried this game but it looks so fun!(a six year old did this)!"
"13401",1119104329,"My kids love it. Very good for spatial orientation"
"13402",1119132775,"The app requires way too much stability in order to accurately measure between surfaces or points. For example, I tried it in my office, measuring from table top to floor. I got significantly different measurements each time and was told I moved the phone too much. I was simply setting the phone on the floor, picking it up, then setting it on the desk top. Naturally, the phone moved and rotated a bit in the act of picking it up and setting it down. I am not sure I could have been more precise in my movements, but apparently the app requires it.   If I scale this activity up for measuring a building, I would not be able to maintain anywhere near this level of precision and stillness. I do not move like a laser. When measuring a space, I have to walk across a room, or many rooms. I  cannot be expected to not tilt, rotate, or otherwise shift my phone as I move from one point to the next. Often times there are pieces of furniture or other objects in the way.   I think the app requires conditions that are too ideal, and for that reason the measurements cannot be trusted. My work requires very accurate measurements.  I think I’ll stick with my laser. It has not let me down except in sunny outdoor settings."
"13403",1119132775,"I have a iPhone 6 and now since the recent update none of the measurements work"
"13404",1119132775,"Very nice app and easy to use. Very useful. Thanks"
"13405",1119322616,"This is hella cathartic"
"13406",1119322616,"I played the original Auralux & when I got the new iPhone the game wasn’t able to be played. Huge surprise to find that this game has become even better than it was. Absolutely in love with it"
"13407",1119322616,"The game is very addictive, a good time passer. So far I have no complaints would recommend it to anyone"
"13408",1119358760,"Another great game from this dev.  Difficulty was just right, but you need a good ear for this music themed game.  There are two endings, the game plays well, no glitches, has a Save option, and ads are not intrusive.  Hope to see more from this dev soon.. Thank you!"

"13411",1119370883,"I’ve been trying to play Loopy birds for over a month...since it was downloadable. If you don’t read reviews or FB or emails, how can you charge for extra moves you have no intention of delivering?  There are levels that are IMPOSSIBLE to solve w/o extra moves...you’re lucky I’m willing to pay for it...most would not but I really enjoy this game when it works.  There are several levels with scoring errors and I’m sure I’ve not found all the issues. Please either fix it or take it down because going thru the App Store for refunds stinks!  They were great, but couldn’t fix your game!"
"13412",1119370883,"Didn't let me get a score of 7"
"13413",1119370883,"Eh"
"13414",1119424086,"Ok I'm too old for this game but still it's so addicting I can't help it!"
"13415",1119424086,"This game is amazing! I'm 12 and this game is so entertaining! These little kid games are very innovative, and ya gotta love em'!"
"13416",1119424086,NA
"13417",1119482395,"I love this game so much but most of the time when I play it freezes and takes me off the game I want to know why nd if I wasted my money or not"
"13418",1119482395,"Great game but it keeps kicking me out after awhile and I don’t know why."
"13419",1119482395,"I love this game so much! I mostly play it when I do not have WiFi on my iPad. I love how you can fix many different peoples hair, and style them however you want. But sometimes it could get a little boring, because there is no challenge. My suggestion is for there to make the customers ask for a specific hairstyle and outfit 🤷‍♀️ great game tho! I still like this game. But if the creators can work on this, that would be great. 🙂"
"13420",1119569595,"I’ve had this game on my phone for a few years now and have never even thought about taking it off. Sometimes I will go through phases where I don’t play it at all for months but then I’ll go back to it and enjoy it just as much as the first time. It’s tricky, challenging, fun and the humor is also on ball. Well done guys! I love this game!"
"13421",1119569595,"I love this game, is so fun and addicting. I spent 5 dollars or so and then got all the characters easily. Then it got boring and I was just waiting for an update. So I deleted it. I downloaded today to find all my progress gone and all my purchases not in game so either fix this or give me a refund because now my 5 dollars is just useless."
"13422",1119569595,"Title. Very very well polished game and unrelenting. Give it a shot."
"13423",1119644926,"Simply amazing!"
"13424",1119644926,"Enjoy this because things that take you away this much are rare and hard to find.   For readers of science fiction who love space operas, this is an unbelievably rich, grippingly-paced, can't-put-down story / RPG. The music and atmosphere are explosively enveloping - use headphones.   I've enjoyed this more than any movie, sci-fi novel, game, or TV show I've come across in the last year.   Can't wait til episode 3."
"13425",1119644926,"This is not really a game or a choose your adventure, it’s a graphic novel where you can make mistakes and have to start over from a checkpoint. I had hoped it was a blend of that and “Out There”, but it’s not. It’s very linear, and there aren’t really any twists, just false choices. Make the wrong choice? You die, go back to checkpoint. That’s not “decisions that matter” that just black and white decisions.  That said, art and music are 5 stars. The story is pretty cool and paints a gorgeously creative picture of experiencing an alien universe, but again the linearity combined with the shortness does make the experience a bit underwhelming. But perhaps that’s just because it’s so creative and awesome, that I want more. I wish I could bring the universe it creates to any of a number of sci-fi games with real gameplay but lackluster story and characters.  I’m off to play the 5-star “Out There” by this same studio, buy that, it’s worth every penny!"
"13426",1119713595,"This is a really good game with multiple endings. My only real complaint is that there are too many useless items and red herrings in the game."
"13427",1119713595,"Once again an incredible story, great puzzles, and lots of heart and humor. Just waiting for the next WadjetEye game now that I’ve finally played ALL of them!"
"13428",1119713595,"Great game"
"13429",1119856566,"Don’t get me wrong I love this game but I started to lose data like characters and story data and I am really confused because it was a update the all of a sudden I’m replying the first mission so plz fix the problem I miss all my good characters"
"13430",1119856566,"As a veteran Blazing player. Have been playing since the beginning of time. This game started out great and the grind was fun and enjoyable. But the main attraction was PvP. Ever since this anniversary they have ruined the game. Imagine waiting almost an entire year for a banner to come out. And you spent a years worth of pearls for the 2 supposedly ground breaking units after fv naruto and sasuke. And then they release a banner right after anniversary and it decimated the game. At this point the game is dying. They have yet to release a new banner where you can actually grind on to get pearls on. Or updated story mode to get any pearls from. So for any veteran players it’s almost impossible to even get any pearls to summon on any banner. And for PvP sake. It has totally been ruined by 2 units. The whole point is to strategize and defeat your opponent. But not when 2 units literally make it unplayable. New body naruto literally removes 2 chakra and ignores everything possible and switch seals for 4 turns. In PvP standpoint (4 turns is the whole entire game) you can’t do anything about that and if you were to try to build a team around that. The units that can even do that are substantially weaker and slower so there’s no point in even running them. It literally shows you how bad the game is now when new players could’ve hopped on and summoned for the new naruto and sasuke and make it to S10 kage league when veteran players struggled without those 2 units. The game used to be fun due to PvP and PvE but one of them is no longer enjoyable and another you can’t even play when you’ve already done it. Also the GUI of this game is trash, the loading times for everything is trash, buying items are 1 by 1, and you load in and out of everything you do. Gree you really are a trash company, you did the same thing to brave frontier."
"13431",1119856566,"I don’t have any idea what is wrong with this game I’m almost rank 150 and all of a sudden my game won’t load past 70% I  don’t want to uninstall and reinstall just to loose my data l"
"13432",1120072154,"This game doesn't let u even get passed getting his hair wet it is stupid unbelievable"
"13433",1120072154,"This game is good"
"13434",1120072154,"This app is the worst!!!!!! I hate it. You have to buy the all the tools just to play"
"13435",1120181386,"Fun and innovative puzzle concept, well-polished, difficulty level builds up at appropriate place, sense of achievement after completing every level with 3 stars...also thank you for GC Achievements."
"13436",1120181386,"Good game. Make you think"
"13437",1120181386,"This is a great game and fun to play with all my favorite game and I love this game play it a lot and I love it so much"
"13438",1120294802,"Everything else seems the same as before. Raid cards seem pretty cool until you can only use them once per entire round of the guild raid bosses. So if you’re only sitting on three, and you use all three in one attack, you’ve screwed yourself out of attacking anymore until the ridiculous time limit on waiting for a raid boss and actually being able to attack NEXT round. Can’t really say anything else about it since I can’t do anything else because of that rule on the cards. Would have been an awesome update other than that."
"13439",1120294802,"Very fun game I enjoy clicker games and it’s very easy to level up and I think it is perfect in every possible way nothing wrong also no ads unless you choose to watch them which is pretty nice awesome game great graphics very fun."
"13440",1120294802,"No idea what the challenge is supposed to be in this game.  No strategy at all just tap the screen."
"13441",1120339123,"Great graphics. No glitches. Good story. Could've used more hidden object scenes. But I enjoyed it."
"13442",1120339123,"Game won’t load after playing it for a while, turning it off and then going back to it. When you hit continue to game, the screen just turns and stays black."
"13443",1120339123,"Will not load!!!!!"
"13444",1120437406,"This is a great game but could you add more cubes because I have all of them"
"13445",1120437406,"cool game, cute characters.  also...what does the u.s. iTunes app store have against system optimizer apps, system memory refreshing apps, & battery boosting apps?  seriously!  every time i find one that does it all, inevitably the app store phases it out.  these types of utilities are readily available in every other store, but not in the u.s. store. it's as though apple doesn't want it's customers to be able to enjoy the benefits of this type of utility, and they don't have the right to decide that for their customers. (and yet they have done just that) hasn't anyone out there noticed this?  i cannot be the only person."
"13446",1120437406,"This game gets more addicting the the more you play,and the graphics are stunningly beautiful,I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new addictive game to play."
"13447",1120471712,"I used this app for my 22 year olds son's birthday and he was over the moon! I definitely suggest it for anyone! I might even use it myself on my birthday!! 💕😍😊🤳🍒😩💋"
"13448",1120471712,"Doesn't give equality to all players"

"13458",1120838254,"This app is beautiful and everything I love about the octonauts. My sound issue was fixed and I love playing this with my baby!"
"13459",1120861209,"Slide puzzle plus rogue plus dating sim? Fun time"
"13460",1120861209,"While this is a lovely little puzzle game, with an interesting system to figure out, I leave it three stars only because the story and situation are so depressing I simply couldn’t play it anymore. What a downer this game is! However, if you love the idea of repeating a cycle of failure in which you are just never good enough, life isn’t fair, and you find yourself always leaving some sweet children to die in the woods in the cold, surrounded by monsters and witches, because you’re just not up to the task, well, have a great time."
"13461",1120861209,"I get the feeling that I have no idea what I’m doing, but I sure do enjoy this game!"
"13462",1120991202,"Too many ads kill this game. For the first 10 minutes I thought it was more than a decent game, til the ads started popping up. Now I’m dealing with ads that are popping up less than a min apart from one another."
"13463",1120991202,"To many ads in this game. Not very challenging and  pay for items in the middle of play field easy to accidentally tap"
"13464",1120991202,"It’s a decent  game but the ads gets annoying after few rounds . Should fix that at least other than that it’s"
"13465",1121157685,"It is a ok game .   Not my favorite but I do play it"
"13466",1121157685,"These new challenges are great, different! Most of the games could make some upgrades which would really enhance the playing.  For a change I would like games with more animals. Great challenges now.I love the new games! Good payouts but they are few and far between. The new games are more interesting and more fun. Looking forward to summer games and then holiday ones!when are the 4th of July games coming out ? They are fantastic still looking for July 4 games. They’re are fun and challenging. Can hardly wait to see the holiday games"
"13467",1121157685,"Great game fun to play!!!"
"13468",1121425007,"Has a lot of bugs and no help from Big Fish.  I've been stuck in the library and I wrote up a request for help, but have gotten no reponse."
"13469",1121425007,"Stuck at mosaic puzzle as are others. No fix coming was told to get a refund.  Don't waste your time and money till they get a full fix for the game."
"13470",1121425007,"The quill in the forgery game is not responding, even after the update!"
"13471",1121463708,"There aren’t many options for making the emoji just items that make no sense and for the sensible one you have to pay. Don’t download stick with your keyboard emoji. This app will be a waste of your time. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"
"13472",1121463708,"They want $9.99 *per week* for a basic graphics editor. Not worth it."
"13473",1121463708,"I used to love this app 😍! Till this annoying dumb update that they made, no offense, but it’s true, they make it so difficult for kids now 🤦‍♀️🙍‍♀️ 😒😫, Now u made it so complicated, I hate it now, and I HAVE TO SCREEN SHOT IT NOW 😕😫😞😒! Please respond and turn it back into the old one, I will rate this 5 stars again if u do 🔙🔛❤️"
"13474",1121484538,"This game is but I put like 10h in to it and I’m still feel like I’m getting no where this shouldn’t be this hard it’s a Mobile game not pc make it feel like one"
"13475",1121484538,"Could never get into this game. Guess I really just don’t understand it very well"
"13476",1121484538,"I LOVE DIS GAME! Oh and please add a new guy named Isaac and please make a new session event for the summer called the parade for free and gives you 100 more people in the summer! I LOVE DIS GAME ITS SO ADDICTING!"
"13477",1121545201,"Agreed"
"13478",1121545201,"Definitely will reccomend"
"13479",1121545201,"Fun concept, keeps ya busy"
"13480",1121659254,"good"
"13481",1121659254,"玩了一阵子 确实不错 比那些只会坑钱不更新的破游戏好"

"13485",1121740066,"I have a cat with no tail, but I can’t make him. My little puppy has a bird marking on her head, and I don’t see any. There are just the shapes of the dogs and cats in the movie, nothing else. There’s not even a dark brown eye option. I don’t like how the options are so limited. This app is not what I wanted for my little dogs."
"13486",1121782467,"From the graphics to the sound design this game just oozes quality.... beautiful and relaxing, highly recommended"
"13487",1121782467,"This game is so frustrating and will need to watch or read a walkthrough to finish the game."
"13488",1121782467,"This game is beautiful. I have played all of the Samorost games since I was about 6 years old. I was so excited when I found this one. I love the lack of instructions. They just set you off. People that speak any language could play this. There is no element of being rushed, so you can take your time in all that you do in the game. Not to mention the story, which  is great!!  Overall, I love this game. Well worth the 6 dollars that I spent!"
"13489",1121910644,"I tried to park but I can't turn"
"13490",1121910644,"I don't know because I haven't played it yet"
"13491",1121910644,"This game looks like fun but every time you turn it will not turn. So it is so easy to hit a car every time. Worst game ever. Don't waste your time."
"13492",1121943475,"I love that this app gives me the ability to set my borders exactly how I want them. Wonderful app, and its extremely easy to use. I definitely give this five stars."
"13493",1121943475,"It’s an OK collage app.  All I found I could do is add filters and adjust borders.  I guess everything else must be locked behind a subscription (not worth it!).  I’m writing this review sideways on my iPad Pro, since the app is in portrait mode only.  I’d say it's average—hence, 3 stars."
"13494",1121943475,"U need to get this . Its perfect for a wallpaper !🤩🤭💖"
"13495",1121963448,"In the “Christmas 2017” tall elevator scene - is it possible to light the wick lamps?"
"13496",1121963448,"Similar comments as above"
"13497",1121963448,"This game is beautifully done.  I love puzzle games that are also visually stimulating. Add to that the amazing, relaxing music and you can't go wrong! Well worth the money. I'd pay for any game these folks put out based on how well this one alone was made."
"13498",1121971067,"Why do you offer us to watch videos to get free coins and have no videos available causing people to lose out on 1000 free coins and then, still not have videos to watch Tibet the other free coins. You shouldn’t have to close the app and reopen it each time just to watch a video.  And fix the other stuff as other reviewers have said!  What the F is wrong with you people that you can’t or won’t fix anything? You allow us to watch videos to get free coins but more often then not, even more so lately, there’s no videos/you get the message, no videos. And when it’s to get the $1,000 coins after the free $500 coins when there’s no video you lose being able to get it if/when you close it.   Why do you bother to f’ing offer free coins for watching videos if you’re not going to have videos/if there’s no videos to watch!!!"
"13499",1121971067,"I have enjoyed playing this game but lately there have been major glitches which need to be addressed.  Connection issues where it reads waiting for opponent to connect, yet I miss a turn because opponent’s internet connection is poor. Combined with playing Bingo and I hit my target and it’s registered as a miss. Yet when I hit it for a second time, the first arrow is still there. Fix this please. What should be a fun game is turning into a glitchy mess."
"13500",1121971067,"This game is actually fun when it loads, which takes me opening and closing the app two or three times. Takes forever to finally get into the actual game. Other than that, it’s a really fun game."
"13501",1122211704,"This is an amazing puzzle game and I’ve almost gotten all the endings but I’ve had trouble with the green button panel. Some buttons don’t appear but others do on that panel. Sometimes none appear. The only fix I have is to wait a couple days. That’s why I can’t get the diamond ending with the wings."
"13502",1122211704,"Wow thx so much for making this game developers I’m enjoying it very much and it’s a great post apocalyptic app I’m always playing it and it’s very strategy please write back to me thx so much.Also I’ll like to mention the hampster part should have some point of opening it just saying.OTHER WISE THX FOR YOUR TIME 😃😃😃👍👍"
"13503",1122211704,"Hope it was worth it :D"
"13504",1122212503,"This game was a lot of fun. Thanks!"
"13505",1122212503,"I have played dozens of these games and this one is very good in comparison. I like the puzzle piece collectibles and the morphing objects, they are tricky at times in this game. As are the mini games but I like a challenge. Don’t get me wrong, I only do casual mode but I still like the thought that goes into making the game tricky. You have to go back to scenes many times to use different objects to open things so that gets a little repetitive but so far so good."
"13506",1122212503,"Don’t buy this for use on iPad. Mine froze during second chapter. I had many discussions with Big Fish and tried all their fixes. Eventually they agreed the game doesn’t work well on iPads. They couldn’t refund my money because I got it through App Store."
"13507",1122439453,"The app is really confusing if you’re not used to their custom UI, The very first few races, the brake button was covered with ads, The steering is very odd and turns veryyyy weird. Uninstalling"
"13508",1122439453,"I love the game but when I finish a level, it covers the content on the bottom and I can't press next."
"13509",1122439453,"They make all the target times impossible because other traffic goes a slow as they can"
"13510",1122444037,"It’s fun up until you get into the higher levels then the game will literally not allow you to progress. The colors will not fall to be able to match more than 2 or 3 so you literally waste your moves unless you use boosters which cost money. Absolutely ridiculous, games are supposed to be about having fun not having a cooperation make money and ruin your enjoyment. You already profit from the commercials you make us watch now at least let us progress and have fun with a game! Deleting right now."
"13511",1122444037,"Fun game but with the new update it doesn’t work at. When I touch the screen to play nothing happens. Everything in the background still moves though"
"13512",1122444037,"I love playing this game on my down time but it’s recently has been crashing whenever I purchase blasts with my silver coins before entering a level. It forces u to restart the app and you end up loosing a life and coins. It’s also has been releasing less levels lately on Wednesday. Which def blows so I end up beating basically all the new levels and then having to wait 3-4 days for new ones. Only to have like 6 new levels 🙄 really irritating."
"13513",1122498143,"i don’t like many games but this one is nice and i can see myself playing it for a while"
"13514",1122498143,"I deleted the game but then it says that I still had it and no matter what I try it won’t go away! I checked the App Store and it said I still had it but when I click open it does nothing! FIX! THIS! NOW! PLEASEEE"
"13515",1122498143,"It’s a great game I love how there is a little bit of music after each level but the music gets better after each level."
"13516",1122621497,"Please put a feedback email where you can suggest emoji’s such as Diallo"
"13517",1122621497,"This is the hugest piece of crap I have ever download! Sorry just my Review. Expecting what was advertised, but I will never be tricked again! Don’t download? Please! Trust me!"
"13518",1122621497,"You have to copy & paste, however, the “emojis” are pasting as large size photos. These are not emojis. Not what I was looking for."
"13519",1122649984,"Has some of the best filters I have seen around in the appstore"
"13520",1122649984,"It’s fast easy and it’s great  Love it"
"13521",1122649984,"Fun app to experiment with.  Such beautiful colors and visual transformation of my artwork.  I love it!"
"13522",1122682633,"This was a great game when you could shout the music off whilst keeping the sound effects turned on. At least that’s how I remembered it used to be. Then my iPad mini died and I couldn’t play this for about a year. Now I have a new iPad and you can’t shut the music off without totally muting all sound in the game. Fix this alone and I’ll be more than happy to reinstall and give it five stars. The music is a deal breaker."
"13523",1122682633,"Pack 2 level 24 needs to be fixed, should be 48 moves, not 44. Other levels are like this as well"
"13524",1122682633,"Really awesome puzzle game"
"13525",1122904897,"Never loads"
"13526",1122904897,"The emojis are so cool. But after I hit the sticker it says copied but it won’t paste."
"13527",1122904897,"I just wish they’d add more shade mojis but they never do"
"13528",1122909751,"This game is so much fun. And the characters look so cool! But I liked the game back before version 1.2 when there were levels to play through that were challenging. Endless runner is fun but can get a little boring and sometimes starts feeling repetitive. The game was changed so much between then and now that they might as well have made a new app and left the levels for those who liked it. Or maybe leave the option to switch between different game modes. That would be the best of both worlds!"
"13529",1122909751,"Super funny!!!!!!!!!!!"
"13530",1122909751,"I love this game and I believe a lot of people would join and play this game again, plz bring back the old one, online game and compete with other players . No one wants to play an offline game."
"13531",1123042939,"Need wind feature again."
"13532",1123042939,"Needs more players, connection is bad, my progress get deleted mid-week, the cost of a speed or strength upgrade gets so expensive, can I see my all-time best throw somewhere?"
"13533",1123042939,"Fun little time passer. Hard to master."
"13534",1123078102,"It seems like I am constantly kicked out of the article I’m reading and regularly have to delete and reload it so I can read the content I’m interested in. Love the stories. The use of the app leaves a lot to be desired."
"13535",1123078102,"Great app but never quit adding leagues.  More options is always better.  NBC has PLL so why not add that here. More soccer leagues, including international soccer"
"13536",1123078102,"Disappointed that Copa America (soccer tournament) is missing"
"13537",1123109531,"Great game. I love it"
"13538",1123109531,"Really great game and fun but it takes a while to get money and the fist you want."
"13539",1123109531,"This game is addicting and fun"
"13540",1123371085,"It always crashes,, I can’t even play the game"
"13541",1123371085,"It’s crashing pls fix"
"13542",1123371085,"I downloaded the game because it looked fun but when I go to open it the app keeps crashing right away. If I keep trying I only get a few seconds to play before it crashes on me. I’ve tried deleting it and then downloading it again but"
"13543",1123455917,"I really like this game but it keeps crashing randomly. If there’s a fix that would be great. Thanks!"
"13544",1123455917,"איך ליב דאס"
"13545",1123455917,"I love the game is super awesome 🤩"
"13546",1123539597,"There’s been trails and bugs but overall that’s the most enjoyable game I’ve played in a long time been here for just over a year I’m up to four characters now I’m enjoying the game"
"13547",1123539597,"If u wanna play Diablo 2 but only have this you'll be satisfied? Guaranteed"
"13548",1123539597,"I have quit this game several times to play new games that come out and out of all the games I’ve played I seem to always return back to this one. It truly is an amazing way to lose yourself and get caught up in the world of arcane."
"13549",1123579511,"Placed 42nd in the tournament and didn’t receive my ticket. Otherwise love the game"
"13550",1123579511,"Nice graphics, fun and addicting."
"13551",1123579511,"Fun. Addictive."
"13552",1123605369,"I just got this game and have no clue of what I am doing and there’s no tutorial or anything. The art style is really cute but the game itself was just too hard. My highest score is 5."
"13553",1123605369,"I’ll just preface this by saying I’ve never wrote a review for an app before, but I enjoy playing this game so much that I want to share some of my thoughts. So first off, this game is awesome. It’s a new concept to me and is challenging and really fun. However, I’ve noticed that once you get to the 50’s 60’s 70’s etc the game gets slightly stale. After 10 you get the addition of the short ladder and fire, at 20 you get the conveyer belt and a bit further you get the ghost on the conveyer belt. ...And that’s it. There is no more new content (at least that I’m aware of) after that. That, I think is where the game falls short. After the 30’s the levels become the same and blend together. I think that this game could very much benefit from adding more to the higher levels. This would allow new players to have the same semi-challenging environment while giving the more experienced players newer challenges and more to overcome."

"13558",1123631069,"Don't waste your time on this app. The daily allowed energy is only 300 plus 130 if you play a game and watch a video. I also purchased energy and twice didn't receive it. I've emailed the support team at least 6 times now. At first they seemed like they were actually working on it but now no one responds. So I'm out 10 bucks and they refuse to give me my money back or give me the energy I never received."
"13559",1123631069,"I play this game for long time I love the stories but I do spend lot money to get energy but I when I try to purchase the energy it some how didn’t gave the energy to continue the story I was mad I did about five or six times and I have to get my refund. They to fix this game because I really want to continue the story just to keep me going and not only this app all the story app is messed up so please fix it."
"13560",1123631069,"I hit the introductory offer twice and never received the credit or refund. I sent many emails with only 1 small response back. I sent them the Apple receipt showing I am changed and still waiting. No one wanted to either give me the Energy points or refund the money. Finally after being ignored from their horrible help desk service, I called apple to get the refund. You have a very nice story however was highly disappointed at your negligence to assist me."

"13574",1123897951,"I bought the vinyl, I got the VR working (which was a challenge with a lack of directions), and I authenticated my code. My phone threw up a notice saying I had low memory, since this app is over half a gig in size(!), so I uninstalled it. A day or two later, I reinstalled it to show a friend and it said that my ""code/email do not match"". There's no contact email and the card says there are no replacement codes, so o guess I'm just bones now? Decent program when it works, but garbage back-end. Wish I could use this, but I guess I'm SOL now. Thanks, whoever designed this dumb app."
"13575",1123897951,"I didn't expect this. I feel it's an awesome experience. The album is phenomenal but the VR experience is PERFECT! I only have the album because I have all his stuff anyway - but I was shocked at the depth of the album and the sheer perfection this app is in relation to it. I'm old, and usually Jack White wins packaging every year- but Childish Gambino hands down is gonna win this year. I'm blown away"

I appreciate the error.. the updates show that they care enough to make changes but it’s like they fix something with one and then the next that problem reappears amongst others. My largest complaint would be the equipping of items.. you select the item.. select equip.. it goes to your mercenary Page... no way around it.. I’ve tried dropping the item.. sending it to stash... nothing works.. my second largest complaint would be that the characters I’ve PAID to unlock are not available without WiFi... that’s ridiculous.. I’ve bought this game simply because of it single player offline capability. Other than those things the game is super fun hella addictive and reminds me of old school diablo II. Or maybe darkstone.. games like that."

Other than that it's a great app. *Seriously though get a lined paper already set to go on the app!!*"

"13592",1124221308,"My biggest issue was how short the game was, even with the *bonus. I like the mini-games where you have to find whatever the image is IF, and that is a big IF, they actually made the object  recognizable. Map was good. Fun to play if it's on sale."
"13593",1124221308,"A good game, but not a great game.  Many HOP's are the same scene used over again, a sign of a lazy crew.  Music did not always fit the mood of the scene.  The Bells were a nice touch, but several were hidden behind other objects, and so tiny any player with a few years in their plate would need a magnifying glass to get them all.  One was hidden at the upper corner nearly behind the ""X"".  The plot was a little thin, and lagged in a few places.  However, even with all of these little negatives, I give it a 3+ (4), because it has rapid transfer from scene to scene, and a nice hop to the needed location."

"13615",1124476992,"Will someone in a position to make decisions PLEASE muster up the impetus to fix this app. I am begging you guys. This would probably be my favorite app of all time if it ran smoothly. These days I rarely get past the loading screen before the app crashes, and on the rare occasions the app does load, I’m only allowed a few seconds of navigation before the app inevitably closes. I understand if there are limitations due to my (slightly) outdated phone/IOS, or the massive scale of the video library the app offers, but if there’s anything the developers can do, PLEASE do it. The idea of the app is so freaking cool, and the clips are amazing in quality, so it makes me so sad that I can’t use the app :("
"13616",1124476992,"Just like the person that left the last review the app is crashing as soon as I try to open it.  This needs to be fixed quickly."

"13651",1126101226,"While I am glad many have found this app helpful, I don’t feel like the timing and nature of the messages is intuitive to what I’m thinking, feeling, or needing at that moment.  For example, one message read “The song you are hearing right now has been sent by God”- well, I was in a restroom stall with absolutely no music playing anywhere at the time. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, when I go to the app to read the message sent by AAM, I can continually scroll through unlimited messages, and not just the one that was sent to me at that hour.  I really wanted to like this app, but it feels inauthentic, and the fact that I can scroll through unlimited messages that are supposed to be meted out to me at the right times by a higher power tells me something here is deeply flawed.  My recommendation: skip this app and save your hard earned money."
"13652",1126101226,"I wanted more explanation on how the app works.  So I selected to have only one message a day yet when I hit the arrow it keeps sliding through new messages. I’m confused arnt I only supposed to get one message if I select one message daily? If I keep hitting the arrow I keep getting new messages do I just have to not hit the arrow again? Or is there a way to make it so only one message comes up at a time. Theres no more explanation as to how the app works in the description so I thought id ask here.  Thanks"
"13653",1126101226,"The layout of the cards, the options, and the art are all cheaply done, not at all sophisticated or deserving of what the cards claim to do."
"13654",1126212440,"Okay l love this game there are no glitches it’s fun but I noticed one day my battery was draining so fast I could not find the problem well I went to settings and looked at battery this was top at the charts for. Battery drainage it said 29 percentage that is way to much that my only complaint about this app it’s so fun but it just drains your battery to much so I am I was really sad to delete this game can’t find another one like it developers if you read this please fix the battery problem plus I think everyone would also appreciate it I mean this game does cost money so this game needs to have that battery problem"
"13655",1126212440,"I have bought this game for $3 and I believe it was well worth the price and lived up to expectations fully. However I can’t feel like there was a lot of potential lost here. The simplicity of this game is what makes it initially love able to play but it gets boring real quick. The way to beat every level is the same. No matter what you’re up against it takes to brain power to figure out how to properly deal with it, but I must express how empty this game feels with its lack of enemy/unit variety. There are two summonable soldiers and the enemy can use them as well, as far as I can tell your “war tree” summons the different types randomly. That’s the one aspect of this game that is appealing and a pleasure to play with. It is for that reason that I take away a star because this game is so simple and yet so much potential is lost because of a lack of variety in anything. New units, perhaps new trees that summon specific units or you choose what your war tree produces when you plant it, would bring this game to life and an open up a new variety of strategies that the player would have to utilize to potentially deal with the new challenges that more unit variety would bring. Given this game is so simple and the A I are direct, it is obvious playing this game adding a new unit would take minimal effort and vastly improve the quality of gameplay and replay ability especially when you factor in the procedural generation this game could easily have."
"13656",1126212440,"I like this game a lot. I am used to different war games but this is whole new level ball park thing. I didn’t want to spend $ but this is no exceptional. I highly recommended this game."

"13663",1126394027,"I’ve been playing this game for almost a year now. It was fun for a while, but slowly became annoying. First of all, I hate how taking your turn costs money. Like, I know it’s supposed to be a strategy game, but seriously? I mean, are you kidding? I’ve gone bankrupt in 4 turns. AFTER buying. No lie. Make the per turn cost 20 dollars, OR DON’T HAVE ONE. Your own earnings are too little, and the small amount you get from the praise and stuff  is pathetic. You spend all of it when it comes to the conspiracies anyway. Second of all, as I said in the title, the decision making results make 0 sense. Say you prevent the mafia from taking over businesses. Why should the common man, opposition, and oligarchies be mad? They are the ones who it affects. This makes the game nigh unplayable. Or why should stricter security screenings make the police and army mad. Occasionally the ups and downs are random. It’s kind of annoying how no faction can stay neutral. Why should the mafia, army, opposition and oligarchies care if I give the cops more donuts? You have to do what one faction wants, and I get that’s the point, but make it logical. Why would the police be mad about me cracking down on crime? Why would the police be happy i let the Mafia steal their cars? It’s so annoying to think you made a good decision, only to find out the faction you wanted to benefit seemed to like something being against them. And the conspiracies are worse. Sometimes you need to pick between two decisions that would be considered conspiracies against you, and the one that costs money is the one that makes the crowd happy. Like what? Me raising an army general’s salary because he was incompetent makes everyone happy, but firing him doesn’t? It’s so stupid, and as I said, YOU DON’T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE OF THE COST PER TURN. All in all, if the developer made the decisions more logical, and made the cost per turn a LOT less, then I would play it, and love it because the concept is wonderful."

Um really wish that when you enter a floor and when you die you can start at that floor instead of doing the previous floor first before getting to the floor you were on. Kinda redundant to do that since the floor is a checkpoint since when you continue even at the boss stage you must start again at the beginning of the floor.

"13687",1126723825,"very addictive!!"
"13688",1126723825,"I love the gameplay it's probably the best game I've played in a while"
"13689",1126723825,"Really, if you like twitch games, it’s just about best of class. For everyone complaining about ads, I have a solution: pay to unlock. Don’t be stingy with greatness, it’s only a dollar or two."
"13690",1126769121,"I love this game but filling the gas takes way to long. I was waiting for like over 2 mins so I have to restart the game."
"13691",1126769121,"It’s good"
"13692",1126769121,"Wiskk"
"13693",1126845799,"I love this app, goes great w my Arturia Spark drum computer app.  Love it!!!!!!!!!"
"13694",1126845799,"Can't save midi cc mapping? Plays super slow on IPad Mini and older. Kinda having a hard time taking this seriously if basic musical app functions are unreliable"
"13695",1126845799,"Love this synth. Just wish the volume was a bit higher. It tends to run lower volume than my other moog synth apps."
"13696",1126845803,"No matter what you do the audio clips and crackles"
"13697",1126845803,"Audio crackles no matter what you do. Electro-Harmonix, please give this app the patch fix it deserves. This app is the only way I will likely ever be able to use the iconic Mini-Synthesizer in my lifetime. Please help us out with a solution!"
"13698",1126845803,"I really want to like this app, but there are some audio engine issues on my iPhone 6s - lots of high frequency crackles on all of the presets make it unusable for anything serious, and unpleasant for anything playful."
"13699",1126932090,"Seems to try and load a virus or ad every time I even try and open the app. Avoid at all costs!"
"13700",1126932090,"It's a nice fun way to get your brain and hands working"
"13701",1126932090,"Uncreative and overly hard."
"13702",1126935885,"I played the first two games when they came out for free, and when then I waited hoping the third to be free as well, but oh well I love playing them because they're a choose your own adventure stories almost"
"13703",1126935885,"I went over the four apps in my review of the first book, I’ll just add a few things. This is even more complex, tricky and fun than the previous work. Having the rewind feature disabled is a questionable choice. I understand it is frustrating. I would have given the choice to the player, between perhaps a beginner/weakling mode where rewinding is still possible and the full adventure as it is now. Or by giving the player the incentive to give up the rewinding. Or by giving a limited number of rewinds, etc. In the game books, after all, whether the rules forbade it or not, you coud always go back to the previous chapter or to the previous intersection. If you put that reservation aside, the app is again one of the best games out there and the whole series deserves high praise and success."
"13704",1126935885,"I agree with another reviewer, make it an option to not have, but don’t make this great series of games into a frustrating ordeal. Please, please bring the rewind function back for this game!"
"13705",1127108818,"I think that we should be able to buy fifa points through the companion app. And the bugs should be fixed"

"13711",1127440445,"So cute and fun :) Elmo is always a favorite in our house :)"
"13712",1127440445,"This was not worth any money. It's cute but there are better free apps that Sesame Street has."

"13714",1127726827,"We purchased this game and made sure our volume is working, reinstalled it and there is no sound..."
"13715",1127726827,"My son is in the spectrum. And he does this game like it’s second nature. Great. Love it"
"13716",1127726827,"My little girl loves this game. She was so happy to have new levels. Keep up the good work. Only thing I’d change is the music lol it puts me to sleep but she likes it."
"13717",1127910488,"Here is another free app that I like. When I compare the pictures it takes to the ones taken with the camera app that comes with iOS, the ones taken with this app seem better exposed and color balance. The disadvantage is, it requires a lot of processing so on my old iPhone 5s, it took a while but on my SE and iPhone 7, it takes significantly less time."
"13718",1127910488,"sometimes it makes sound when i shot"
"13719",1127910488,"only gets 4 out 5 for 2 reasons - one it crashes frequently on ios 12.1 and the uploader only lets you choose from your local photo library to enhance a previously taken photo"
"13720",1127930385,"If you use it right then it will turn out great."
"13721",1127930385,"I changed mobile carriers and had to upgrade my phone in order to switch. Went from Samsung 7 to Apple Xr (just due to sale and cost) and this Verizon app made it very easy to transfer photos and contacts. What didn’t transfer were my Android apps—some had Apple versions but my actual (paid) Android apps didn’t transfer. Will unfortunately have to research what to do about those on my own."
"13722",1127930385,"I have used this app two times now. It has made transferring phones extremely accessible and easy without having to call Verizon or go to the store like I have had to do in the past. The app works quickly, smoothly, and the directions are simple to follow."
"13723",1127933116,"This game makes me feel like a DJ"
"13724",1127933116,"Hoping the levels will become more challenging!"
"13725",1127933116,"The game is a bit challenging and has a lurking curve but it’s also a good puzzle experience and makes beautiful shapes"
"13726",1128070374,"Neat little game. I would pay to not have to watch the ads (which are for games that look very stupid) after dying just to get back to the home screen. This is a real black eye on an otherwise promising game. Makes me not want to play it."
"13727",1128070374,"I really like this game. It’s super simple and yet super fun! I would definitely recommend."
"13728",1128070374,"I love this game. I love that it's free. I play Dungeons and Dragons- Like the pen and paper version- and this reminds me so much of it. I recommend this to anyone who loves dungeon crawlers!"
"13729",1128311260,"This app is okay, but I was looking for something more. I’m interested in making room and body sprays but this app didn’t have those recipes. I may find a use for this app in the future though."
"13730",1128311260,"I downloaded this today but it does not have the features I need. How can I get a refund?"
"13731",1128311260,"It’s my go to app for all essential oil. I use it all the time. The recipes are wonderful and have made many of them. I use this app when looking for an oil as it is easier to use them looking it up on YL website. When I receive my ER order I go in and update my inventory right away. Helps me keep track of my oils."
"13732",1128326130,"I've finished a few other Kairo games and this one was a let down. I think I'm about halfway through and the game has stopped doing anything new. I don't think I'll finish it."
"13733",1128326130,"It's a great game. The only problem was the last update. It wiped my save I'm upset but I'm not going to write a one star review on something that might not have been the devs fault. Other than that it's a four star game but -1 star for wiped save"
"13734",1128326130,"worst Karo game ever"
"13735",1128623591,"I found Dr Oz stress plan but can’t use it what am I doing wrong?"

"13738",1128801236,"I’ve beaten this game twice, yet I still come back and download it again. This game is a blast and the creators should be proud of this game. Five stars."
"13739",1128801236,"For some reason, it will not allow me to pay to remove ads. I find this extremely annoying. It also seems purposeful, since there is a button in the game for that function. I’ve been playing for a while, but I just can’t take the ads anymore. So, see...Nitrome, you could have made some more money from me, but now I’m just going to delete the game."
"13740",1128801236,"This is a really good game, but there could be more levels. Or a way you can make your own levels and such."
"13741",1128839212,"Love this game"
"13742",1128839212,"Fun game.  I can spend hours playing this.  So many different things going on you don’t get bored."
"13743",1128839212,"When playing this & the other 2 Forest Rescue games they freeze up, is there anyway I can get updates for them so this doesn’t happen?"
"13744",1128855720,"I have always loved this game but when you try to buy in app purchases you never get the item that you pay for. You don’t get ANYTHING! I bought five gold cards that cost $4.99 and I got nothing. Oh Bibi needs to fix this. And there are way to many ads. Otherwise I think it’s a great game."
"13745",1128855720,"Good"
"13746",1128855720,"I’m having fun with this game but ever since the first tutorial race I can’t do any more? I don’t know if it’s intentional but I want to race."
"13747",1128940693,"I love the game it’s one that is just easy and fun but I think there is A lot of potential for this game like multiplayer or other game modes. So developers please keep this game going."
"13748",1128940693,"Good graphics, fun gameplay, cool concept."
"13749",1128940693,"I have only gripes about this game after attempting to enjoy it several times. 1. There's no real tutorial for piloting the lander. 2. If you fly the lander away from the shuttle, you will—for no apparent reason—reverse course and slam back into the shuttle, destroying the lander. 3. There's a never-ending stream of dialogue that takes up part of the screen that can't be skipped and is too slow to focus on. I tried to read it, but it's not engaging, entertaining, or informative. 4. The gameplay is extremely repetitive and frustratingly difficult, even on the easiest setting. 5. You're always working against a timer, which can build tension if used correctly, but the time limit is too short for new players to get used to the mechanics and have proper time to explore the various objects and enemies found on the asteroids.  Developers, you can still fix this game. Start with 10 minutes on the timer, gradually decreasing that as the player makes progress. Also start with as much of a tutorial for piloting the lander and dealing with the asteroid gravity as the one for controlling the astronaut (the only fun part so far). Let players skip from one message to the next one. Explain some of the pick-ups on the asteroids.  I keep finding this bubble thing, but can't seem to use it for anything. Good luck."
"13750",1129050711,"Why is it someone can rob you 18 times bomb you 23 times and you can’t get them back. It seems pretty unfair to me. Only thing to do is delete them or the game."
"13751",1129050711,"I am completely hooked on this game! I absolutely love it! I spend more money on this game than I do my own self! It’s worth it though! You get to have a lot of fun and meet so many wonderful people. Give it a try you will become addicted as well! I also want to say I finished my last island and I think the game developers should not let you get bombed or money stolen! I feel as if you have to wait for the next island to come out and you are finished with the game that your island should be protected as well as your money! I think it is unfair that you move on automatically to the next island when you are done but when you finish the game you have to wait until the next island comes out in a week or so and you have to keep checking on it to make sure that you are not being bombed. I think the game developers need to change that!!"
"13752",1129050711,"I love the game graphics are cool and the game is entertaining"
"13753",1129234419,"I just got this game and looking at the views no one complained about the adds! As happy as could be, I open the app. I beat the first level, Add. Try the second level but use a hint, Add. Beat that level, Add. Like I said, I just got this app, I may or may not get the no add extension pack. But for those who can’t and have to watch adds, do NOT download. I repeat, do NOT download!!!!  (P.S, the game it self is fun, but not with constant adds.)"
"13754",1129234419,"I get an ad after every single level, and after every single hint. It’s not even worth the $2 to get rid of them. Just make the app cost that much if you’re gonna be that big of a greedy douche"
"13755",1129234419,"I like the game, but I can hardly play any of it. Every time I restart a level, or move on to the next, there’s a 30 second add waiting for me. Don’t get me wrong that is how these people get money, so I’m ok with a few adds here and there, but this is just ridiculous. The worst part is I feel like they do this on purpose. They knew how obnoxious the adds were, so they made it so you can PAY to turn them off. Now that makes sense, but it basically forces you to buy it because the game isn’t any fun unless you pay to turn off the adds."
"13756",1129404572,"Can Big Fish do ANYTHING without witchcraft? The little symbols throughout most of their games are clearly evil and wrong for anyone."
"13757",1129404572,"Short game, short review.  Other reviewers have mentioned the color, story plot, and collectibles, etc.  I felt the plot was a little thin, but interesting.  My biggest complaint was the minuscule length of the game, and the bonus game was like a small mid-West town:  Blink and you miss it!  PS-I never review a game until I have completed it, but thanks to those who quickly and thoroughly review new games!  I never buy a game without reading at least 3 solid reviews, and Big Fish only keeps new games at a reasonable price for 3 days."
"13758",1129404572,"Some of the BF games of late have been a little too creepy for me. While I don't always want to be a princess, I don't want to be a homicide detective either. This game has a nice balance of suspense and eeriness without venturing into true horror.  You've most likely already read the reviews about the storyline and the land of Emoless--so I'll get right to the game itself.  Fundamentals are good. Voice overs, cutscenes, graphics, labeled inventory, teleporting map, collectibles, etc. are hard to argue with.  Good against evil main plot is fun, too.  Minigames are fun and diverse, albeit pretty easy.  I didn't play this until after the sale was over, but given the short length, the lack of originality in some of the puzzles, and ease of puzzles, I don't think it is worth the full fare. If it were discounted again, I would recommend it, but I can't do the same at full price.  Good wishes to all.  🍂🍂"

"13763",1129693551,"Trucks are slow in Drive or Reverse and the levels are hard. This game will probably still be hard even if your a pro. This is not the best Parking game, it could be better."
"13764",1129693551,"You absolute idiots it was level what 15 or so when we had to reverse the trailer the green one where you have a parking lot next to you. Yeah it was level 15 and because of that darn thing I had to stay up almost ALL NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! until about one 1 o'clock in the morning you absolute idiots I can't believe that you would do that level you people must be in cahoots You $@"",{%s I also agree with: VlogGames57YT not you people you want to be the mayor of LOOSERVILLE GO RIGHT AHEAD"

"13768",1129966892,"It's a good game and has enough room to level up with out spending a lot, or you can and it isn't too expensive. It has a lot of potential, but it doesn't seem like the developer is investing a lot into the server or in marketing, which would make this game one of the top games to play free. They could make some serious money and have a great platform, it's just not being run correctly to capitalize on what they have."
"13769",1129966892,"Just started playing and so far so fun so :)"

"13778",1130374815,"I got this for Christmas. The first time it worked like a charm! But, after a second use, it got glitchy.  1: the camera turns white and glitches like hell 2: disconnects every few minutes 3: always unresponsive  4: terrible sound 5: doesn’t record videos and the microphone doesn’t send audio. 6: you have to be kidding by “spy bot”. It is SUPER LOUD. this was a massive disappointment. I’m hoping to get the MeBo 2.0.  If that won’t work, I’ll warn other about this piece of trash"
"13779",1130374815,"It's a bad app .I never ever recommend getting this app.It is terrible.After a while the app doesn't work.After that it is just a plastic toy.I think that I would rather get a app that works. I hate this app.The only good thing was that it worked for a while and it was fun for a while. Thank you for looking at this review."
"13780",1130398188,"When I use this app on GarageBand, for some reason it keeps quitting. If you fix this bug again, then I will give it five stars. I like the synths though."
"13781",1130398188,"I got this app shortly after it came out.i have all their other synths and was so excited to get.im running ios8.4 but the app will not open past the brief page that displays then nothing. I contacted apple twice for refund and contacted the developer a couple times. After the initial contact they gave me a suggestion to try nut still no change. I really wanted it to work but now I'm ignored which puts me back. I have many apps over past 8 years without this problem. I don't know what to do and lost over $10 and not happy. Beware this app and poor service."
"13782",1130398188,"I own too many synth apps that are so so. This one does not disappoint in terms of sound or interface. So good"
"13783",1130498044,"The problem I had with my MacBook was probably super simple but nevertheless, this app is great since it’s very convenient! Apple really knows their audience, huh?   I rarely write reviews (though I feel like I should start doing so), but the service deserved one! Awesome customer service; I didn’t feel like a bother at all and it was actually a very pleasant exchange even though I’ve been on edge because of the problem I had with my MacBook. The solution I was given was helpful and it worked!"
"13784",1130498044,"When I chat with an Apple employee, things are usually resolved quick and easy. The thing I noticed today, was that when I tried to email the chat transcript, it says it’s unable to email it."

"13797",1130723425,"Great game"
"13798",1130829481,"It’s so good you should really get it"
"13799",1130829481,"Very dope app!"
"13800",1130829481,"Honestly this mod is so good and easy!!"
"13801",1130901077,"Ok this game is just wow. I love that there’s no levels no upgrades no any off that it’s simply just download and race but I do have one suggestion. I wish there was a reply mode were you could watch the race from different camera angles but the game is amazing and keep up the good work."
"13802",1130901077,"I love this game so much. It’s graphics, its gameplay completely throws F1 Mobile Racing into the ground, and its an incredible game! Theres just one problem.  If this game ever gets updated, make sure that there should be a option for iCloud backups from device to device. My iPhone on season mode was on the Brazil race, (20th race on the season) and i never went on F1 for about a week. A week goes by and I go to do the Brazil Grand Prix, but it restarted everything, season, race setups, and race weekends! I was very outraged by it, so I thought I could load the save from my iPad, that was on the Canadian GP, and it didnt work. This is a 5 star worth game, but I’m not putting 5 stars till this get added."
"13803",1130901077,"It is awesome, it is the best racing game on mobile. So you should get it."
"13804",1131203560,"This app is an amazing app because it helps you learn more and helps you understand what things mean"
"13805",1131203560,"Can you PLEASE make it so you can delete old accounts. I didn’t like my old account so I tried to make a new one with the same email address and it didn’t let me because it was already in use. PLEASE fix this. This is such a good game other than that. If you fix it I will definitely fix my review. Thank You!"
"13806",1131203560,"Overall this app is amazing, you can play games, riddles and quizzes! ALTHOUGH this app is a bit confusing and I really hated how they didn’t give me enough time to figure out the answer for the questions, but still great."
"13807",1131232060,"After reading all the mixed reviews, I was afraid I wasn't going to fully enjoy this game. But so far, I'm loving it; the music is so good, the aesthetic and art of the weapons and sounds - pretty cool.  This would help, there should be an indicator as to when your weapon's ammunition is at max, that way people won't waste ammo pick ups while not knowing they are at max already.  Good game so far - keep up the improvements!  Omg the music is sooo gooood!! 😀"
"13808",1131232060,"Although this game is described to be a rogue-like, I was disappointed that many of the elements like permadeath, steep difficulty increase, traps, and unique items do not appear. I enjoyed the awesome music, pixel art, and thematic mashups from other games. At the moment this is more like a strategic clicker than a rogue-like game."
"13809",1131232060,"Finally a simple rpg that doesn't overwhelm you with overly done crafting mechanics and just focuses on easy to pick up hard to master strategy/inventory managing fun combat. Art and sound is fun and perfect for this game."
"13810",1131251130,"We love it! I like the non-verbal directions. The app is ideal for my students who have trouble with oral directions in English."

"13813",1131342792,"At the moment I am pretty upset, but I am hopeful for a resolution to the issue.  Aside from that I am pretty happy with the service , exception being that the area I am in has been really slow my first work week.   I enjoy being able to see new places in my community that I had no idea existed, and met some very nice people.    Delivery pickups are fairly quick and easy to navigate in the App and Delivery has been pretty simple as well.   I just wished that the App would integrate with my AV display in my vehicle, so that I can mirror the app features on the larger screen, and not have to keep picking up my phone to see what is going on and interact with the app, with the touch screen.  It would also allow me to see new messages and orders easier.   I wish that the Uber Eats support system would be handled and contacted separate from the Ride Share support folks.  It is apparently an issue when the ride share support group has no idea of the policies that govern the operations of the Uber Eats driver; which has caused some issues between myself and Uber Ride share Drivers Support crew.   One tried to suspend my account because I disagreed with him on territory policy, and claimed that Uber didn’t operate in my area.  Funny how I was able to work in my area for the last work week.  Duh!   Now with that being said, I figure that for the first week of my work, with Uber Eats has been really fun and enjoyable; in spite of the issues that just came up.    I am hopeful that a productive resolution will be worked out, as I would not want to be pushed into consideration of going elsewhere.  But we shall see what the outcome will be."
"13814",1131342792,"I’ve dedicated 2.5 years of my life driving for uber and it is so unpredictable. I live in a BUSY city (Denver) and lately I’ve been waiting multiple hours for a single ride!!! Thank God for lyft. I have driven over 4,600 trips on uber alone and have managed to have an overall 4.97 driver rating (which is easily in the top of the charts) and my thanks for being a good driver is waiting hours for a single request even when it’s surging in downtown Denver? There is no incentive for having a high rating so what’s the point of driving safe and going the extra mile to smile and help people with their luggage when drivers  with much lower ratings are getting rides while I’m stuck fiddling my thumb waiting. Absolutely BS!!!!! Getting frustrated and uber is going to lose a good driver because I can’t deal with this much longer!!!! It’s ridiculous!!!"
"13815",1131342792,"I’m wasn’t sure to do it but I’m really happy for what I been done in those 2 past days!! I’m really thinking about to do Uber drive beside the delivery!!! That’s how exciting I am!"
"13816",1131344092,"Great music, but this game is just a copy of color switch"
"13817",1131344092,"Who can play this game for hours at once?!! If I have attained a certain level... I should be able to go to a meeting and pick back up where I left off!"
"13818",1131344092,"But not when they pop up IN THE MIDDLE OF GAMEPLAY. I don't know if this is intentional, or a bug, but its happened to me more then several times. One time I was about to beat my highscore and was interrupted by an AD. The game just stopped in the middle of gameplay and started playing an ad."
"13819",1131388981,"Just downloaded the game And nothing works. Very upset. Makers please help me fix it"
"13820",1131388981,"Have played 5 games and two of them have just stopped working."
"13821",1131388981,"The game just crashes. Don’t waste you time. It makes me not want to buy the card game. If they can’t respect their customer enough to create a working product why should I spend my money on any more of their products?"
"13822",1131422575,"I have been looking for a hard game to play and this is the one I think so far"
"13823",1131422575,"Fun!! Hard to control"
"13824",1131422575,"Fun! Hard to control sometimes...finger gets in the way!  Otherwise - I enjoy it very much."
"13825",1131590898,"Would like my money back. Seriously disappointing, from the controls to the lack of original level selection. Just bad."
"13826",1131590898,"Too easy....to be fair I have a ton of experience with LUMINES... the controls are a little wonky at first but I have over 8 hours logged on the same match on endless and have never come close to the match ending... the skins never really get difficult enough..even with the more  narrow field this game is no challenge for an experienced player, not bad if you need to kill 5-10 minutes here and there."
"13827",1131590898,"Needs better controls"
"13828",1132158938,"Me"
"13829",1132158938,"The baby is bad"
"13830",1132158938,"Hi I’m MaddyTheDolphin and I have to say that this game is pretty awesome and I am having so much fun playing so I think you will too so you definitely should get this app and have as much fun as I did🐬!!!"
"13831",1132201707,"Love it!!! DefentLy  get the app!!"
"13832",1132201707,"It needs to let you do more things like go to the hair salon and other stuff"
"13833",1132201707,"I HATE PAYING so someone was lagging me out some how so 3 star ⭐️⭐️⭐️ I got so mad 😡 I stop ✋ playing I have ben playing this for a couple weeks I hate it when people lag me out I got lagged out on games 6/25 games so that it bye 👋!"
"13834",1132213599,"So awesome"
"13835",1132213599,"My kiddos love this game sooo much! 😊❤️"
"13836",1132213599,"I like this gameI want to play it please."
"13837",1132214105,"So awesome so cool so AMAZING 😘😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍"
"13838",1132214105,"I Like it Because I want Everyone go on that PLANE and MAKE THE SAME MOVE!"
"13839",1132214105,"THIS GAME ROCKS!!!! IT IS SO FUN AND YOU CAN DO BASICALLY ANYTHING !! IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I LOVE YOUR GAMES SAGO MINI!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗"
"13840",1132336222,"Every single game I’ve ever played from Ketchapp was solely created for the ads. Have you ever heard of a game that shows you 3 ads the very first time you opened the app, even before you played the game. 😡 For that reason from now on if I see that a game was made by Ketchapp I won’t even bother to give it a try because I already know that it’s going to be trash. #AvoidKetchapp"
"13841",1132336222,"played for 10-15 seconds. restarted 3 times.  starts out way too difficult for me. not interested in taking 15-30 minutes before i can enjoy it. others might. it seems well designed though. ad obnoxious level as per other reviews,  confirmed"
"13842",1132336222,"It's a hard game to play, that's not a large problem though. There are too many ads which makes everything so laggy. We all hate ads but it's even worse when there are 10Xs more ads than there should be and the ads make it lag!"
"13843",1132515131,"👍👍👍"
"13844",1132515131,"Waiting for book3"
"13845",1132515131,"When does the next book come out?"
"13846",1132517788,"I wanted to know that I like the game and I love th way it is and I understand the best way you can have Reviews.  Except that I you like the review you can love the review even that’s what I want. Guess me and I will lick your body and the fairytales were cool except for vanellope. Like my review and fairytale story. Don’t worry if you break something. We can rebuild it together!"
"13847",1132517788,"I paid for this app and thought it would be great. Unfortunately my daughter showed me that half of the features don't even work. No soundtracks, I can't flip characters, and more. I've tried restarting and reinstalling and still nothing. Also don't expect support from the company, their website has no way of helping you and the App Store link for support takes you to an error page. Clearly, they don't care."
"13848",1132517788,"I wanted to buy this app but I couldn't understand why this app has only 13 reviews. The free version was good as well except there was only one fairytale theme. That's why I bought this app so I can get all the fairytale themes! And it does have more fairytale themes. It's fun! It's a lot better than Toca Boca apps. Safe fun and kid friendly! It's so fun to mix fairytales together and you can even put together scenes and save it and edit them later! So convenient! Lot better than Frozen Story Theater! Keep up the good work!"
"13849",1132537738,"Game has overpriced itself in the market. Very few low cost options to gain strength and status. The game used to have great options from spending anything from .99 cents and up now to get the major rewards they want $250.00 and up still play but don’t pay. I’m vip 10 which means I’ve spent over $1000.00 and was happy with my previous play and spending but that is no longer the case"
"13850",1132537738,"Gameplay is relatively fun, but the acting is left of the horrible. It’s hard to get past it for me, but maybe some people won’t mind how silly it is."
"13851",1132537738,"Great, Great game👍"
"13852",1132539563,"Draw a straight line through rapidly swirling shapes—requires extremely quick reflexes.  Only 4 stars because it so soon got too difficult for me to do."
"13853",1132539563,"Finding where to draw your line is the fun part of the game, but it's pretty frustrating when you have such a small window in which to draw it. If you're not twitchy enough to get it right, you are rewarded by having to wait for the sequence to line up again. Not a puzzle, not interesting for long, not fun."
"13854",1132539563,"Good!!"
"13855",1132542642,"I love when they make sounds I like the purple cat ,cause it’s my favorite Eric Carle stories are so cool even the hungry caterpillar I love the music in this app send story toys apps are so cool"
"13856",1132542642,"My son loves this app, but for some reason the sound does not work.  I have tried everything and I am very tech savvy. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it. Please help!"
"13857",1132542642,"My grandson loves the book, and this app is a great extension for him to play with. We love recording our own animal sounds, and sometimes record us saying the names of the animals, instead. At first the sound wasn’t working, but I emailed support, and someone responded promptly, the next day, with the exact suggestion I needed to make the sound work (by turning off the mute switch!)."
"13858",1132630378,"I love art💞 This game is too small🙁 But it’s awesome 🤗"
"13859",1132630378,"AMP is a great intro for young kids to the basic concepts of drawing by using different shapes. I’m a graphic designer and was keen for my son to get an early start as an artist, this game uses a story game format to really engage kids while improving their motor skills. His favorite part is drawing the outhouse and the doggie. Another great game from Minilab studios!"
"13860",1132630378,"Me being older than the age it's made for and still liking it is amazing. Or I'm just weird. XD But I love the focus on shapes! The art work is really cute and it has a tiny plot! I was able to get this free bc it was the free app of the week (which tells you it purty Gud) idk how much it actually is but I think it should be around erm 99 cents"
"13861",1132754743,"Run jump with the most likeable character, killer time."
"13862",1132754743,"The characters are adorable! I love the little win animations. It's also a really innovative tap based gameplay mechanic. My only critique is that it stars off easy and stays easy. I never really felt challenged. Something about the spinning animals is mesmerizing thoug... I couldn't put it down."
"13863",1132754743,"I love this game, it's really easy to get into and it's super addictive! I don't really think there's nothing quite like this, the graphics are really fun and it's really enjoyable to play. Totally recommend it"
"13864",1132762804,"Awesome news service very professional"
"13865",1132762804,"Five stars"
"13866",1132762804,"La aplicación debería tener el traductor en español y otros idiomas"
"13867",1132817034,"It refreshes that's all that matters now if every one post on here the moment you catch a Pokemon ppl will have time to drive walk to location. Other apps simply post findings and then don't refresh. Spawns don't stay the same for non commen to rare Pokemon. This is first one I found that refreshes or at least time stamps each find so I know it's good. Going to get some Pokemon ""peace"""
"13868",1132817034,"How is this supposed to help me find pokemons ?"
"13869",1132817034,"It is clear to me that a majority of those leaving reviews for this app do not understand that this isn't a radar that shows you right when a pokemon spawns or where one is at all times, it is a crowdsourced app that shows previous spawn points for pokemon that are inputted by other users. Contrary to everyone's beliefs, this app does exactly as it is supposed to. The only REAL problem with the app as well as with the multitude of other apps exactly like this one is that because users input the data, it may or may not be true. Some people put in real and helpful information, while unfortunately, others don't. I wouldn't recommend downloading the app just due to that fact."
"13870",1132842255,"This game is horrible. There is no control you just press a button it bump the ball. Waste of a dollar."
"13871",1132842255,"Terrible game. You can't even move the players around and you just have to press some buttons.. Don't waste your money on it."
"13872",1132842255,"Terrible game !!! Unfortunately lose money buying this game ! Crap app ! I want my money back!"
"13873",1132915398,"This might not be a game but it is artistic and awesome, 3 Dollars will spend,. It only problem it has is a little short but from what I saw it has a excellent atmosphere and beautiful scenery to match it detailed levels. Each level has its own story to tell in a very unique way, that I never seen before.  Perfect master piece I recommend to everyone who enjoys a small but interesting experience, you can’t go wrong with this."
"13874",1132915398,"Bizarre and beautiful, plus the sound design is superb.  As stated, this is not a game in any sense of the word.  This is interactive art that will transport if the individual interacting with it allows it to do so.  Best played in the dark with headphones on.  Herbal stimulation not necessary but is certainly complimentary.  😏"
"13875",1132915398,"Love the style, mood , and surrealism of this place. Enjoyed very much, hope there will be a sequel some day"
"13876",1132992868,"I like the idea of gamification, if you use this app, more stuff is unlocked?  I've slept to it twice, I see 5ish scenes, can make it rain, on my tent, with birds singing.  How much use is required to unlock more features?  Do I have to actively be using it to earn points?  Or using it as background noise generator?  Sleep aid?  Please let me know Franz, or another experienced flow-er....  thanks."
"13877",1132992868,"It was so nice"
"13878",1132992868,"I use this app for reading when I need a bit of calming white noise, and for sleeping when I’m sharing a room with someone who snores.  The rain sounds are perfectly clear, and the ability to customize and adjust the sound levels of rain, stream, and birdsong adds a lot to the experience."
"13879",1133173046,"Fun game.  But get anywhere you really need to spend money on the unit upgrade packs or the enemy will easily overpower you.  Waiting for shards and equipment upgrades is very slow unless you purchase them."
"13880",1133173046,"I have been playing this game for about 20 days, and I'd definitely say it's a great game. However, tonight I was trying to playing this game, it said 'user credentials do not match' and I just could not log in. I looked for support, but there was no such issues. It is driving me mad!!!"
"13881",1133173046,"Since upgrade on 9/16/2019 I can no longer play app. It now displays an authentication failure error, which won’t allow me to bypass.  Since I didn’t signup when I started using this app, I suspect this is a bug.  Hope it’s fixed soon."
"13882",1133241575,"The other reviewer's noted that it felt a little short and it did. But I liked the game. I like that it didn't have any super creepy dark spooky music in the background. And it would be cool if we could go back and find the collectibles we missed. I missed one!"
"13883",1133241575,"Love these types of games"
"13884",1133241575,"This game was so boring I didn't finish it.  No glitches, just a thrown together dud.  I enjoy fairy tales, dragons etc... but this was just a bunch of uninteresting cut scenes punctuated by supposedly hidden object scenes (the objects weren't hidden unless you were visually impaired) and some ridiculously repetitive mini games.  Throwing in a bunch of admittedly adorable critters does not make a poor game any more engaging."
"13885",1133510322,"I am not allowed to pay for games and I love this game"
"13886",1133510322,"DANCE you forgot dance and yes dance is a sport"
"13887",1133510322,"Ok so my children were super excited to play but then when we found out that you have to pay for sports and that made them upset so I would highly recommend that you make the game actually free because my kids love it just they are sad that you have to pay for other sports."
"13888",1133737578,"Great, great game. Seamless gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, compelling visuals, thoughtful subject matter. Buy now!!!!!!!!"
"13889",1133737578,"Just wow. I can’t really put into words the message this game imparted on me. The interaction between the two “beings” says it all without a word being said. One cannot fly without the other, if one falls the other comes back, the interaction between the two was brilliant. Just absolutely breathtaking and beautiful. I cried. That’s all that really needs to be said."
"13890",1133737578,"I’ve been wanting to try this game for a long time and I finally got it. I really liked the in game settings and the music that goes well with the plot. The last chapter of the game is what really got me. It’s kind of a sad game but also relax at the same time. The only thing that I wish for is for you guys to develop more chapters and make some new updates in the game so that we are not just stuck with the same contents, this could help others be interested too. Thank you."
"13891",1133744473,"The game is amazing, but I wish it supported more complication styles and was optimized for the series 4 apple watch"
"13892",1133744473,"Great game very fun my only complaint is that I don't know how to change gamemode on Apple watch"
"13893",1133744473,"I don't know how to change the game mode and it's boring"
"13894",1133749572,"The game itself is a good arcade game. Nothing special, very simple, with nice background music. The problem is that after playing it for a while, there is no more variety. I have maxed out all the possible color schemes for my game piece, so I'm just accumulating useless points. Additionally, the game map itself is just three or four of the same structures infinitely repeated. It's very repetitive, and it's getting boring. As is the case with all of these free arcade games, the ads are very intrusive and have even destroyed my score by popping up during the game! All in all, good game, but these glaring issues make it too boring to play after a while."
"13895",1133749572,"It’s a good game but adds keep on popping up mid game when I play and it’s just really frustrating can you plz fix that?"
"13896",1133749572,"I LOVE this game! The aesthetic of it is very nice and chill, it's a very relaxing game. Only flaw I feel is that there should be an option to lower or increase control sensitivity. At times the controls feel quite heavy and can mess up the player's timing."
"13897",1133883216,"It’s a great game. Still trying to get past any level after the normal difficulty of the real world level. There are no guides or hints or walkthroughs to help out, but I’ll keep trying. Good job developers!"
"13898",1133883216,"Definitely fun to play around with! Recommend this game if you’re into games like Plague Inc.  Review 2: The developers should also make another game where you try to freeze the planet and not burn it. Fantastic!"
"13899",1133883216,"I love the game, but I’m wondering if you can add the following features: - if music/effects are off, play external music at normal volume. Right now it plays at a lightly muted volume if I’m in game. - disable tutorials if I’ve played a specific campaign - make it easier to level up! I know this goes against the IAP scheme in this game, but it would be nice to have a more fruitful unlock system."
"13900",1133896041,"I really like this game. Especially for children. But it would be better if you could multiple click it. It would be easier to click the duckies 🙃"
"13901",1133896041,"WAY to much ads. It's annoying when you're on the middle of playing the game and a bunch of ads pop up.😒"
"13902",1133896041,"This game looks cool at first but then just get boring. All you have to do is tap the ducks and explode  them before they explode. You can also start chain reactions from exploding the ducks. Within the 10 mins of playing the game I got bored of this. If they added more things like power ups or even and arcade mode this game would be so much better."
"13903",1133898987,"This is a copycat of Crossy road,but more fun."
"13904",1133898987,"OMG I can't believe I downloaded the pictures on the App Store for this game they're not real that's not what you do and jumping over obstacles that is stupid this game is horrible and you guys need to fix it up I can't believe I downloaded the pictures on the App Store for this game they're not real that's not what you do and jumping over obstacles that's a stupid this game is horrible and you guys need to fix it up I'm not trying to be rude I'm not trying to be rude. it makes me want to cry and I never been so disappointed at a game You guys need to really do what it says on the pictures on the App Store bye for now."
"13905",1133898987,"Hi I'm in the logang It's cool"
"13906",1133990005,"Let me start by saying this game is fun. The game is very challenging and addictive. Easy gameplay, good graphics. Ads are frustrating though. Overall great game."
"13907",1133990005,"A perfect arcade game!"
"13908",1133990005,NA
"13909",1134086133,"Honestly, I was a bit skeptical of the app when I heard about it...but it's surprisingly addictive, and it has spread throughout my friend group very quickly.   The interface is smooth, the product works seamlessly with my iPhone, and it makes playing Pokemon Go tons of fun. I'd give it a shot if you're on the fence."
"13910",1134086133,"The devs of this app don't monitor the locations and photos. I saw a picture of a dead person as one of the Pokemon locations."
"13911",1134086133,"Love Pokemon go, love this app!"
"13912",1134126831,"Good Science App with Lots of Activities.  My only suggestion is for additional information or some sort of links to learn more about the given activities would be nice."
"13913",1134126831,"I’m starting to get into engineering in high school and loved how many simulations there are,  but these are way to basic. It gives you an introduction but you only have 5 min worth of material from each simulation. Example: the Build an Atom only let’s use 10 protons. You only get to learn about 10 atoms???"
"13914",1134126831,"My kids like to “play” PhET, and I like to watch them exploring and discovering science and math ideas with these simulations! Definitely a go-to choice for our family when we are traveling ... and I love that it runs without needing a connection."
"13915",1134176687,"5/5 love these emojis! They make me laugh every time I use them and it's honestly my favorite emoji keyboard"
"13916",1134176687,"My brother is a swimmer so it's awesome!"
"13917",1134176687,"Just like Michael Phelps they are perfect and are useful for every situation"
"13918",1134511982,"Please remove this game or fix it, it keeps switching to safari and last time to pornographic images!!"
"13919",1134511982,"I like this tangram like game a lot, and almost was willing to put up with the ad redirects (it opens up a browser spontaneously mid game, even when you’re not close to tapping the ad target), ugh even when it happened 2-3 times a game. But most recently it’s been crashing mid game and not saving the game with is frustrating. That was the last straw."
"13920",1134511982,"I really like this game, but I have deleted and redownloaded it twice already. It seems to have some type of bug where it stops in the middle of the game, opens safari, then says “unable to load page” and if you try to go back to the game it keeps doing it over and over until it eventually freezes and you lose whatever game you were playing and have to start over. I would love it if you could fix this glitch."
"13921",1134516647,"I love the game but less ads would be great!!!"
"13922",1134516647,"Dear Developer, Please make it to wear there is not so many adds there is one every time I finish a level ☹️😠 please take them away!!!!! Other than that I like the game."
"13923",1134516647,"Ok I don’t mind ads BUT not the long ones! Apple I know you can put ads other ways! Everyone listen. Before you start the game they have long ads that they put on, I don’t enjoy a game if I have to each a long ad every level, I’m standing my ground! So I will not be playing this game unless they do something with those long ads! NO MONEY here!its been at least a month and still they put the long ads no they don’t want you to enjoy a game. You would think they would listen to the buyers! Deleting this for good! Apple u can do better!!!"
"13924",1134640800,"The game opens, I hit start and nothing. The screen goes black. Major problems"
"13925",1134640800,"I'm enjoying this game very much.  Good story line, nice graphics, excellent mini games. Best of all is NO evil, witchery, murders, thank you."
"13926",1134640800,"This is the worst episode of Echoes of the Pasr game I have ever played!"
"13927",1134805859,"I wasn’t sure what to expect after reading the reviews but I really liked this game. It was pretty hard for me at first figuring out what to do but I really liked it once I got the hang of the clues. After you finish the game, make sure you play it again (2nd round) because it has new challenges. I just bought the Isoland 2 and can’t wait to work through that. Have fun!"
"13928",1134805859,"Each hint requires 1 dollar or watch a 30 sec ad to unlock in a paid game, and there are well over 50 hints. Other paid puzzle adventure games has a time based system to unlock the hints, such as the room, giving players the time to try to solve on their own but also gives players the necessary hints when they are stuck for free. I do not understand why the hint system in this game is behind a pay wall or an ad wall, when clearly there is a better solution available in nearly every game in this category. This just seems to be a cash grab, especially in a game that is not free to purchase."
"13929",1134805859,"It’s not easy if u don’t like thinking or find it difficult to solve puzzles this is not the game for u"
"13930",1134835650,"This game is pretty good I hope they make a third one"
"13931",1134835650,"I hope it can support change language to Chinese Thanks"
"13932",1134835650,".99$ seems like it's really cheap, and it is. The game is great and worth that price, however once you get in the game there's and option to buy a 'fortune ticket' for about ten bucks.  Doing so allows for certain options that you were previously lacking, allowing for more hands free grinding. Personally, I bought it, feels like the game needed it, hence the 4 star rating.  For 11 bucks, this game deserves about that.  Strategy has potential to be really deep, and it scratches a bit of that ogre battle 64 itch. Give it a go, it's worth it.  Also, the ticket is a one time thing. No micro transaction pay to win crap at time of writing, which is both admirable and rare in a phone game."
"13933",1134895689,"It’s good"
"13934",1134895689,"Very epic"
"13935",1134895689,"They add new ships here and there, but by and large this game is just more of the same thing over and over. Same enemies, same weapons, same everything. Overall the game is profoundly lacking in originality or really any kind of exciting content whatsoever. You’re better off playing almost any other app game. Phoenix 2 is not worth playing."
"13936",1135031533,"On at couple of levels at least, there are objects that block that camera's view at essential turns that are made often for restarts. This makes it a matter of timing, which is fine, but if the timing is off from the music, holding that timing in your head can get annoying.   To the developer, just go through and find these areas where objects are obscuring the the turns and we'll be golden.  To the consumer, the game is an interesting idea built around the idea that you not only will fall, but you have to sometimes to move forward. Nice little sentiment there, but there are some frustrating aspects (like I mentioned above) that seem more like design flaws than challenges. Can I get past these ""flaws"" of course, with practice. But I'd rather overcome challenges that feel like their part of the game, not a design oversight.   Give it a whirl while it's free. If not free, maybe browse a bit further to see if another game steals your interest."
"13937",1135031533,"I'm a sucker for puzzle games and I was really excited for this one. The game looks beautiful and has a calming soundtrack, but becomes frustrating very quickly. You never know which direction your character is going to turn. There are white coins on the map not sure if you're suppose to collect them or not but many lead to death. Some maps have switches that open new paths, and the second you click a switch you fall off the map. By the time you reach the end of a level it feels like more of a chore, rather than feeling a sense of accomplishment.  I do enjoy challenging puzzle games , but with poor level design and random controls I can't find enjoyment in this.  Update to 1 star I have never paid for an app and still get ads. Really annoying, most apps you pay for will remove the ads."
"13938",1135031533,"This review is middling-to-fair that, while this is more effective than meditation apps for mindfulness, the ads are too distracting sometimes to play.  I'm a perfectionist when it comes to most games. I will restart levels for the smallest of mistakes. Because most games seem to have a taunting set-up, 'this EASY level took you THIRTY tries??'  This game stands calmly and gently opposed to that. Mistakes are welcome, encouraged, and rewarded. The glowing cubes to collect often are along the wrong path. The option of skipping a level is only there as a reminder that, it's okay if you're frustrated, you can try again later.  The level design is exactly how this succeeds in what meditation apps can't for me. There is something unknown out there. You can't see the whole level. You have to engage and explore and, even if you anticipate something, you can easily see how you do or don't ""succeed in completing"" whatever task you were attempting.  I know that the developers probably can't control exactly what kind of ads they have, but the game would be much better if they didn't flash. It's fair and understandable that they're there, which is why I rated a 4 rather than say a 3. (I was recommended this on an article of pricey but currently free apps. The ads being there surprised me as the app prices tended to be $3-5.)"
"13939",1135126803,"THIS GAME BURRITO BISON IS HELLA FUNNI AND IS JUST A GOOD GAME KINDA LIKE JETPACK JOYRIDE BUT WAY MORE FUN THE PIÑATAS ARE SO FUNNY AND THE ADS ARE EXITABLE ANYTIME AND NO POP UPS WHICH ARE AMAZING THIS GANE GOES SKITZZZZZ"
"13940",1135126803,"It is so much fun and I play it every day"
"13941",1135126803,"Good game but it is addictive also make it so when you break the wall have a check point"
"13942",1135127134,"Great story. This is a lot of fun. I’m glad I found this."
"13943",1135127134,"Very rare but occasional crashing which is why it’s a 4/5 instead of 5/5"
"13944",1135127134,"Entertaining, fun, great story. Keeps you on your toes."
"13945",1135213693,"I've played this game for a while now, and I like it to a point. I get that it's supposed to be challenging, but this game glitches all the time for me because I don't think there's been one update since I've actually downloaded this game, so whenever it glitches it makes the time I'm playing unfair which annoys me. So there are issues that need to be fixed so playing it is actually enjoyable."
"13946",1135213693,"I really would like the game if it let you jump all the time and was actually possible to pass certain parts. Also the game does lag a bit"
"13947",1135213693,"I kinda like this game, but I kinda don't. The highest score I can achieve is 259 and I got lucky. Once you get so far, it stops you. I believe the path you take sets up the rest of the game, got it? But, it's also random, from that path. One easy, one hard. Good luck!"
"13948",1135354652,"For the tickets I get that you want people to get on every once and a while but still I hate when I’m in the car for half an hour and I can’t even play a mission"

"13950",1135354652,"Perfect game to play."
"13951",1135372103,"I love the cars and there theme song. They are so cool🚘🚘🚘. Just can you add music for every car in the next parking."
"13952",1135372103,"This is the first time I review a game.. I really enjoy playing this game. But until when I cleared all the first 70 stages (total 75) with gold medals, I found out that I still need a huge amount of coins (above 20k) to unlock the final car.. which makes me feel kinda sad to the game.. I can't play the last 5 mission just because of this.. hopefully you can fix this 'bug' as soon as possible :)"
"13953",1135372103,"It's a great game but it has some kinks in there, but overall it's pretty awesome and there is also SOME glitches! It was better than I though"
"13954",1135441810,"Whenever I do a trick the drone does not let me have any control and plumbers to the ground, I cant even throttle up to make it stop flying down. Also on all of the drones the way you control the throttle is weird and the first time you use each drone it gives you no throttle controls."
"13955",1135441810,"This is a great little app for practicing. Just wish it had more maps and things to maneuver around"
"13956",1135441810,"This app may be unrealistic, but it teaches you how to handle a drone. I’m kinda better at flying a camera drone than flying a drone without a camera.The problem is that I cannot or buy a real sky viper because my Mom won’t let me afford one, yet a real video drone sounds fun to me. And any time I need help flying my LUMI drone, I can use the app"
"13957",1135518748,"Yes"
"13958",1135518748,"This game is really fun and I love the art work :)😊"
"13959",1135518748,"Very few ads and a lot to work for and look forward to so overall a very enjoyable game for mobile"
"13960",1135596302,"I just downloaded this game and I already love it so much and I just had to buy the extra packs. It’s just so amazing and I’m going to buy your new app. And I totally recommend this to everyone. I hope you make more pack for this in the future and I hope you make more games like this."
"13961",1135596302,"Was looking for a Relaxing(Not Irritating) app to play around with, making musical compositions—LONGER THAN 6 OR 8 NOTES —this was “PICK OF THE WEEK”—HA!—just a TECHNIQUE TO BOOST SALES  I Notice the great reviews are from people who got this app Free a year ago- I assume they got more....  ALTHOUGH—REVIEWERS WHO COULDN’t  EVEN GET THE APP TO WORK-HAVE 2, 3, & even 4 STARS ON THEIR REVIEWS- WHAT’S THAT ABOUT?? ***THIS VERSION IS ONLY 4 (or 5)months old*** - Why are most of the reviews shown 1year old??   For $1.99, I got one 6 note Lily Pad (SOMETIMES AN 8 NOTE LILY) that will play those 6 (or 8) notes, OVER & OVER....supposedly there are 6 lilies Somewhere,  HAVE NEVER SEEN MULTIPLE LILIES on a screen —as advertised (see pictures of app) ONLY 6 (or Sometimes 8) “note choices” can be made at one time, they “go away”, & 6 more can be chosen....not how I play with a keyboard           >> NO TUTORIAL <<  >>DEVELOPER CLAIMS THERE’s A Save option: “You can save and load your {6 note} compositions in the lily ponds screen, which you will find by tapping the lily ponds button in the bottom right corner of the app.” **THE ONLY Bottom Right Corner “BUTTON” found leads to a screen that’s NOT USER FRIENDLY, AND/OR, OPTIONS WORK INCONSISTENTLY—hard to tell—FRUSTRATING, LIKE REST OF APP.  >>It appears that, even if one could (laboriously) compose & then manage to get 6 lilies to play in sequence, The resulting “composition” would contain only 36 (or 48?) Notes....wow      An 8 note lily pad Sometimes Appears-when I first Open the app-don’t know where it comes from or goes to —compositions also disappear ... can’t find a Save option anyway... Mostly there’s that (repeating) 6 note composition option 😔💤 .....Would bore a 4 year old  Easy to get stuck in the Ad-BUY THIS area. VERY EASY TO PURCHASE MORE. Still not sure where(or if!) there’s a multiple LILY PLAY area .... APP SHOULD ENABLE PURCHASER TO:    **Easily PLAY & SAVE WORK—LONGER THAN 6 or 8 NOTES— Should be focus of App    **use Controls that work consistently  But —ALWAYS EASY TO FIND ADS—- App big on pushing PURCHASES for MORE LILIES 😞 also CONTAINS ADS FOR OTHER APPS☹️  ALSO: CONTAINS (customer)VIDEOS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU USE APP  But—REQUIRES USE OF (burning up of) HI-SPEED DATA PLAN, so I don’t know if any of them teach anything-doesn’t seem hopeful  COMMUNITY POSTINGS: —postings read were of no help in using app— HOW TO questions are asked there, but no answers are given Some Compositions are posted--appears hardly anyone viewing or listening to them"
"13962",1135596302,"Adding ability to export would allow me to rate this quite lovely app 5 stars.  Imo, being able to save the audio to files, use it with Audiobus, or export to an iOS daw or other music app is key for me....Sharing a little melody on FB or Twitter is nice for a lotta people, I’m sure but to use this WITH other sounds created from other musical apps is pretty standard nowadays and would be amazing, as the sounds here are super useful and good quality..... All in all, love the sounds and the ability to add layers of melody....Push the app a little more and open the export option and I’ll give 5 stars happily and sing its praises.   Update: Due to the developer’s quick and personalized response to some suggestions I had for this graceful app, which I’m sure will now  happen, 5 stars."
"13963",1135638235,"This is the BEST money I've ever spent. This app is pretty great a I personally love it. I can't do the splits, but now everyone thinks I can, because I sent video proof!! This app is great. It is great indeed."

On both apps, the messages bland, lacking depth and never seem to match any situation.  Between these sets and the failure of the developer to update several apps for later iOS versions, these were my last DV purchases ever made.

"13985",1135867247,"This is a game of chance, and a very basic on at that. The design is nice, but there is little depth. The description suggests it helps teach fruits from around the world and 'forms'. When really all you do is spin a wheel and collect fruit. Beyond matching colors to the four fruits on the trees, there is no education going on. It only says the names of the fruits once, and that is the first time you play.  My son and I played 7 or 8 rounds of this. We only finished gathering the fruit before Theo stole them on the very first attempt. We planted our 3 seeds, then spent the remaining rounds losing our fruit to Theo.  Perhaps the actual board game, with its multiplayer mode, is more fun and involves some actual thinking. I had planned on buying it for my son soon, but I now doubt I will."

"13987",1135973816,"I got this game (and MANY others) during the New Years sale. Most of them were old and only barely interesting. This one was a wonderful exception. The storyline was logical and engaging. The puzzles were varied in type and difficulty with many new twists on traditional formats. The bonus chapter wrapped up the story instead of presenting a lame prequel or unrelated use of beta version scenes and puzzles. Well done! I hope the next one is as good!"
"13988",1135973816,"Well worth the $2.99."
"13989",1135973816,"I think if you were just starting on the BF HOS games it would be a good introductory game. Nothing was wrong with it as far as the game play and story.  I thought it was very short and for me, the puzzles were beginner level.  The great HOS games are much harder puzzles and more complicated graphics and storyline."

"14001",1136136909,"This game really is fun. It makes it easy to get more coins if you run out and prizes are pretty generous.

"14015",1136678843,"I got this because I saw Dungeon Warfare 2 on toucharcade, and wanted to see how part 1 was, and found this was a little cheaper, so I thought I’d check this out first. Its gameplay is actually better than Kingdom Rush (the whole series), The catch is the pixel art is ugly. It’s messed up my studying for almost 2 weeks. The length of the game is ridiculously long. Fun Fun Fun, Evil Evil Evil lol"

"14017",1136744871,"Best game ever"
"14018",1136744871,"This game is not worth it’s price. It is kind of fun but just not worth it. It also seems like sometimes someone gets alerted when you do nothing, causing the police and partygoers to attack, sometimes making you start over a level that you almost finished. Overall, this game is not very engaging and not very fun. It is definitely not worth the price of $6.99."
"14019",1136744871,"I enjoy this game a lot. It’s fun, it’s challenging, and it’s a great thing to do in your free time. But there seem to be some glitches or something with the unlockable characters. Specifically, I have met the requirements to unlock both Katie and the ninja several times without unlocking them. I have had the cops chase me around 5 times before giving up, and I have played 3 games now where not a single body was detected. I’m feeling very frustrated because I have met the requirements to unlock these characters and yet they aren’t unlocked. It seems like more people than just me are having this issue. Fixing it would make the game much more enjoyable."

"14021",1136936929,"Love this game, but I have a suggestion. I hope it’s possible. If you developers know the movie Avatar, then please read. I want you guys to make an Ultimate Ikran Simulator. Those big dragon things. So how it could work is the ikran choices to unlock are all different colors. Like purple, green, blue, etc... The setting could be the legendary floating islands, and the rainforest that you see in the movie. Every once in a while, the Navi people can show up and the ikrans can try to avoid them, or maybe kill them. The ikrans can be predators, and they can eat several other avatar creatures that live in the forest. I hope that you guys can make this. Respond to this when you made the app, or if you cannot make this. I suggest to get permission from the Avatar movie creators if you ever make this game. I’m counting on you guys because you make the best ever animal simulator apps. Thanks, and good luck! 😉🙏"
"14022",1136936929,"(If you like this, I suggest listening to a song called Tails One). Ash impatiently waited for the right moment. The herd needed to scatter. She slowly walked the perimeter of the prey circle. Ash then sat behind a bush, again, waiting. She dug her claws into the sand. “Come on.” She whispered. Most of the zebras were asleep, but still others were guarding them. It had to be almost dawn by now. A sudden sound caught Ash’s attention, and she twitched her ears, hoping to get a clearer sound. Ash looked over to where the giant moon was shining, half of it unseen below the ground. It reflected off of Ash’s curious eyes as she gasped. Ash saw another wild animal. A silhouette of one anyway. She turned away from the zebras completely. Her stomach rumbled as she took a guilty gaze back at her meal. She hadn’t eaten in forever though. The silhouette stopped running, and stared straight at Ash. She turned away from it, stalking the zebras once more. Perfect! One of the children had wandered off too far, and everyone (including the child) was asleep. It was too risky to go after an adult right now. Ash zoomed over to it, very gently picking it up. The child didn’t wake up. Good, she thought. She silently ran to her den with the child in her mouth. The sun began to crest over the Savanna land. The child woke up, drowsily looking up at Ash. It’s eyes opened wide, and it tried to scream and run, but Ash clamped her jaws around its neck. She bit down. Hard. Immediately, the child went limp. Ash delightfully gobbled it down. She curled up, hoping for some rest. A sudden thought nudged at her. Who was that last night? She squeezed her eye and repositioned, but she sat up, frustrated. A cheetah ran up to her. “Fang!” She shouted, happy to see her brother again. He looked terribly upset. “What happened?” Ash asked, full of concern. “Mother is dead.” He said sadly. Ash let it sink in, then threw herself at the stone wall, causing her shoulder to bleed. “WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS!!!?” She screamed, listening to her echoing cries. A hiss from outside the den sounded. “Did you hear that?” Fang asked. Ash nodded, not caring at the moment. An alligator walked in, hissing more. Ash gasped. Her and Fang growled back. Pain sliced through Ash’s leg. She hissed in a breath, looking behind at it. Another alligator snapped its jaws at her and tried to bite her leg again. “Fang, there’s another one!” Ash exclaimed. Fang attacked the first alligator. In three seconds, Fang was dead. Ash looked with wide eyes for a long time. The alligators tried to kill Ash too, but she raced out of her den, now homeless and alone. She ran out faster than she ever had. Tears blurred her vision repeatedly. The cheetah silhouette walked up to her and Ash tripped, her vision still hazy and blurry. The cheetah looked at her. “You ok?” He asked. Ash nodded. “I’m Blur.” He said as he helped Ash up. That’s where it all began. Not long later, they became mates. Ash looked in the distance at her new home, smiling happily at Blur and their cub, who was sleeping in between them. There was a cheetah. One Ash could’ve sworn she saw before. She stood up. “Mom?” She asked in disbelief. Ash raced towards her, feeling exhilarated to run. They almost got to each other when the ground split and shook. “What the-? What’s going on!?” Ash shouted to Blur. Blur picked up their cub, Dash, and ran over to her. A large gap opened in the earth, and Ash watched her mother and her family hang on to the edge, Dash squealing for help. Ash couldn’t save anyone. She was frozen. For the first time in the world, Ash’s fur turned black. She ran over to save them both with her newly found super-speed...  The world turned black. Ash saw nothing but darkness. It was confusing, then she saw why. Ash was not supposed to exist. Now that her existence had become irrelevant, the world had to swallow her up, starting with her family. That’s why Fang died. That’s why she was going to die. Her superpowers made sure of that. Wait- her superpowers!!! Ash ran and ran and ran until her paws hurt. She was running up the earth, but she didn’t know if she had time to save anyone this time. She almost made it to the top, and the earth closed up on her, just like that. She was moving so fast, though, that she was simply phasing through the earth. Ash would soon fall into space. She closed her eyes. Though her life seemed to be speeding by in her memories, she took everything for granted. Ash opened her eyes, and she was on the ground. What just happened? Ash looked around. It was the Savanna. Blur walked up to her. “Ash!” He said excitedly, “We can time travel!”  TO BE CONTINUED."

Since I didn’t have enough funds, I was only able to purchase two of the four available cases. When connected to the internet, I had no problem playing the cases I owned, but while I was offline, despite having already been paid for, I was unable to access them as a text reading ‘Purchase Content’ restricted my entry. I hope I’m not asking for too much, but please fix this Capcom."

Please return it to the way it was, I’ll gladly give it 5 stars if you do, this new model, would have made a nice new game mode, but I preferred the other two.

"14067",1138117315,"I love this game! I like that you don’t need a controller and that it’s great exercise.   But....  I wish you didn’t have to pay. I understand that the developers use that to make money, but I just wish that you could start a player off with 30 tokens or something, not two! Other than that, this is an overall awesome game!"
"14068",1138360976,"All it does is estimate CP for evolution of a very limited number of pokemon. You have to manually input, so it is no easier than just using a good website that does the same. There is no other info; no best moveset, max CP, IV, nothing."
"14069",1138360976,"I don't like the estimated CP update. I just want to see one number when I check the estimated CP of a Pokémon not a range of numbers. I keep track of the Pokémon I want to evolve by using the CP I can't do that by picking a random CP out of the range of numbers for a Pokémon. I want the rest of the Pokémon generations on this app."

There is always a doduo right on top of my house, according to the map. Instead, there is a... snubbull, gulpin, pidgey, bulbasaur, etc. also, I checked in phillidelphia, and it said that there was nothing but those Pokémon, when I know for sure that there are solrocks and stuff because I CAUGHT THEM. Try making a companion app that takes in data from what people actually find instead of making up your own data, Sh*theads."
"14076",1138587244,"This app is horrible it’s the worst thing I’ve ever downloaded it doesn’t help at all and there’s a timer on the Pokémon and there’s so many ads it needs to be fixed"

I will be mid flight then all of a sudden the controls just stop working. I have to press my screen a few times to get the helicopter to fly again — if I haven’t already crashed. Please fix this bug!!"
"14078",1138819531,"I love how you can play with helicopters and get new guns in the game. I have no problems with the app oh it was so great. I love your games company. You should make Dustoff three. And make the H.I.N.D. Cost regular money from the game. I bought the H.I.N.D. on all my devices. I love it the game is so great I think you should go on. If you would do this for me and all the other players it will make me so happy. And please notify all players including me Brandon Michael Duomenis."

I have to wait for 3 hours or more after the game for you to update my total points. Don’t let me start about bonus points, I don’t even know how much time it takes you to add them.  Secondly, when I am making an transfer and I go to check future fixtures for some player, it is not updated since gameweek 2!Seriously?! The only purpose of this app is supposed to be an live checking app for points in the game, and it is not working at all!  Shame on you for releasing this crappy app on the market!"

The ground is really glitchy and crashing is to easy. If you hardly hit any object you crash and $14.99 for unlimited rewind is way to expensive   You cant drive on the water except for the parts covered in rock. Otherwise the game is fine👎👌👍"

"14104",1139753965,"I was so excited to see this was getting re-done, but even though it's different it's just as hard as the first version to advance, if not more difficult.  I'm stuck in chapter 2 because it's requiring me to upgrade my hero, which I can only do by beating puzzles (which i can't do right now), getting free pieces from the tavern (once a day), or purchasing gems. I have tried to purchase four different packages and I got charged for all of them but didn't receive anything I paid for. So basically the game is impossible AND will rip you off. Very disappointed."

"14107",1140023495,"The app is amazing. The VR videos are entertaining and there is a vast variety of them to choose from. My only complaint is that I have to take my phone out of the VR headset every time I want to watch a video. I think it would be cool if there was something like the VRVideoWorld app that allowed us to use the app entirely in VR and control what we want to watch by looking at the options."

Highly recommend this game!! 💕"

"14122",1140396820,"The game is all about timing when to disappear and when to re-appear. My high score is 27 and I played for like 5 minutes already. The game is not confusing at all."
"14123",1140396820,"I see a lot of negative reviews due to no instructions, the controls are extremely simple and I figured them out right a way. However the game is quite repetitive and vanishing is not instantaneous."

"14132",1140451547,"Crazy, this app really works great! Never expected to have so much fun with a golf app. Had it for a week now and not yet even scratched the surface of all the features this app has. Love it!"
"14133",1140451547,"I don’t write reviews but need to share my experience with this app. It is absolutely phenomenal! Hs a ton of different features and has blown all of my expectations away. If you play golf then Shot Tracer is a must have app!"
"14134",1140495295,"I have enjoyed the game so far, but unfortunately a bug causes the screen to be cut off on the right side and bottom. I can’t find a fix anywhere other than someone mentioning the iphone XR has this issue. I doubt this will ever get fixed but if it does that’d be cool because this game is adorable and I’d like to give it a real chance."

"14138",1140513212,"Sometimes it feels like the other characters are ganging up on you. I had the game freeze up once...had to leave for about a day. A little more explanation of the different types of games is needed.  (Classic vs. Story)"
"14139",1140513212,"I like fun quick board games.  This is a fun quick board game.  I do not regret purchasing this game and you won’t either."
"14140",1140680115,"It’s fun I love the fast past but it lags the Character ahead the pad and it makes the challenges and runs harder."
"14141",1140680115,"Could I give this game no stars??? The ads are horrible! The stop you right when you're building up speed and then not to mention that those stupid Sweet Water ads don't EVER go away. You have to exit the app and restart to play again. On top of that the game is just bad in general. Sorry 😔"
"14142",1140680115,"It’s over all pretty great, it’s simple and addicting. My only gripe with it is that I don’t think they know what the mute button is supposed to do. If I’m bored I’ll listen to a podcast in the background and play these type of games but it’s hard to do that with this one when the mute button doesn’t do anything. A small oversight that’s just annoying more than anything"
"14143",1141037183,"Good visuals, fun experience, but glad I didn't eaten by the unicorn and bear."

"14149",1141096674,"I love the simplicity of the app. I also love the backstory to John and the risks he took to pay to have an app built for his idea and then go out and spread the word. That's an admirable quality, especially from a 77 yr old man. 99% of people half his age could never take an idea from start to finish like this. Well done, sir."

This game is much harder than the first, almost unreasonably. Also, they took away the orange sparks you get when you hole out."
"14153",1141118819,"I have been playing this game for very long. Today I joined a multi player game with my friends, and all of a sudden, I was not doing well. This can’t be a problem with my skill, I’m too good. This game is broken. Please fix it."

"14161",1141358828,"The game play is fun compelling and competitive   Two complaints:  1: it seems like I spend more time watching adds to open loot I’ve already won, even after buying the whole season pack it seems weird I still have to watch adds  2: I couldn’t figure out how to flag another players name as inappropriate"
"14162",1141358828,"No ads, no prompts to buy stuff, no wait time. It keeps on challenging with new levels and difficulty. I have only played the campaign so far, but I’m loving it. Highly recommended."
"14163",1141358828,"I have had it “installing” for a WEEK."
"14164",1141643627,"The screen goes completely black making the app completely unusable. And yes, I deleted the app then downloaded it again. Does the same thing on my iPhone and iPad."
"14165",1141643627,"App not rendering on iPhone X.  I’m using the latest iOS and app version.  Spinner just spins."
"14166",1141643627,"I love whataburger and their app concept but I get so annoyed when I order carryout through the app and arrive to the store to find out my order never sent. Big issue that needs to be resolved."
"14167",1141738848,"Another good one from this dev.  Plays well, no glitches, has a manual save, and there are two endings.  Minus a star because this one seems to have more full page video ads than dev's other games.  They display each time you save or un-pause the game :("

"14170",1141762073,"Only got a few puzzles in & I could not figure out the answer.  The hint sucked & in order to see the solution, you have to spend money. Bottom line...I deleted the app. I love brain teasers, but this one is not for me"
"14171",1141762073,"Good game"
"14172",1141762073,"Did it for the coins"
"14173",1141842849,"First of all the arrow keys are too close together. And when you crash your not hitting anything. Last but not least your when you press forward it sometimes breaks your car. And on the taxi level it is very hard to pass one of the levels."
"14174",1141842849,"I love this game and I play every day this game"
"14175",1141842849,"How did you attach the car to the tow truck"
"14176",1141876504,"This game is so much fun can you tell me the updates"
"14177",1141876504,"Good game overall. Only downside is that as you progress through the game, it ultimately crashes and will not allow the game to restart or reboot. The only cure I have seen is to repeatedly uninstall and then reinstall. Time consuming and annoying. And be sure to log in and save your progress through FB or another means. Otherwise you will lose all progress when you have to reboot."
"14178",1141876504,"Recomendable"

"14180",1142016085,"Deserves more tan 5 stars. A master piece"
"14181",1142016085,"Firstly, if you are colorblind (or even partially, like me) be warned that several of the puzzles depend on color matching to solve. But that not why I gave it such a low rating, I don’t expect the world to cater to me.  I rated the game so low because several of the puzzles just flat don’t make sense. Even after resorting to watching the walkthrough for a couple of them,I was left scratching my head and thinking “ok, but it still doesn’t make sense...”  The story is definitely... unique. I will give it that. All around, for the price I don’t feel like I wasted my money. However, I would not recommend it to a friend. If you really like puzzles and need to kill a few hours and the price is under $2.00, eh, just don’t say you weren’t warned."
"14182",1142223652,"Terrible graphics on iPad. Using Unity personal edition - not for commercial use."
"14183",1142223652,"Gorgeous game, lovely to play, way too short!"
"14184",1142223652,"Enjoyed this little gem..short, easy, but clever and unique.  Ads are not intrusive, gameplay is smooth, has autosave.  Hope to see more from this dev..thank you!!"
"14185",1142228312,"This game was SO AWESOME 😎I have played with my mom and I have the other games to they are so fun!! I wish it could be better!!🙂🙂🙂"
"14186",1142228312,"I thought I was rating another game and gave this game 5 stars."
"14187",1142228312,"Sorry, have to change my review after discovering this atrocity...but they are dropping this project/game for good when I already paid full price and they PROMISED new content (in the form of ATLEAST one more level update; it even says in-game 'factory level coming soon!')...but now they say they have 'other projects' they are working on?? Excuse me?? So the fans that finance your game company deserve to get screwed over...and this game obviously did well financially as it was either premium pay with no ads, or free play with ads and the leaderboards show over half a million players! You mean to tell me you didn't make enough money to at least finish what you promised?? Shady business move and everyone should rate this game 1 star and boycott future games from a developer that could abandon you at any moment without warning.  Apple - you need to take direct action against devs pulling this unethical nonsense. This game should be pulled immediately so no other unsuspecting VICTIM pays full price based on a lie for an incomplete game. IOS games are finally being treated with respect with great games coming out; then you get devs like this who give ios AND the App Store a BAD NAME. This honestly feels illegal, and I have no quarrels about bringing it to the attention of the agencies who regulate this sort of thing."
"14188",1142261822,"But one of my teacher’s assistants, Ms. Beth hates zoos. It will break her heart when I show her the “poor” animals behind fences and glass in the game. It better then putting them behind bars 😉. We have a zoo in my city. They’re going to add lions and giraffes (YAEEEEEHHH!)."
"14189",1142261822,"I help my preschool grandson with this and he loves it.  Some reading skills are required, so Nana has to be present.  His favorites are matching animal sounds with pictures, coloring stripes or spots on animals, as well as pressing the recurring popcorn box to make more popcorn.  The entire sequence keeps his full attention.  Well worth the purchase!"
"14190",1142261822,"I love how it takes kids to the zoo without going anywhere! Last week we took a long road Trip and the first thing my daughters yelled was Grandpa! Grandma!"
"14191",1142334232,"I love the ""live updates"", but wow, this is the most notification SPAM I've ever seen.  I love NHL and NFL notifications, but I could care less about NBA, PGA, or anything else. I turn off those alerts daily, after I get ""home run alert"", or anytime a golfer blows his $&@! nose.  Please fix this.  Love the app, for what I like it for, but someday, I will unistall it because I can't silence the excessive notifications that I could care less about."
"14192",1142334232,"I know the app overall deserves more than a 1-star rating. However, the PGA leaderboard is so useless it is beyond frustrating. Whenever it auto refreshes, it reloads the whole leaderboard at the top. It literally makes me angry trying to use it. Unfortunately, the Draftkings app links directly into to it as well."
"14193",1142334232,"I think you need to stop activating alerts from sports I'm not interested in. I turn off all alerts other than Nba/NFL and after so much time, I'm suddenly getting alerts for PGA and MLB. Cut it out."
"14194",1142345991,"Played all day can't get pass level 5! Too hard, not fun anymore. Will give up!"
"14195",1142345991,"FUUUUUUN"
"14196",1142345991,"I am a person who has no problem buying in-app purchases, but when my money is stolen I will be contacting apple. If this isn't fixed soon."
"14197",1142348885,"absolutely loved this one!"
"14198",1142348885,"Thanx for the heads-up, Izzyoc (and Dracyy) and for telling us about upcoming games. I just wanted to let everybody know that I really handed BigFish their heads on a platter, for the whole Puppet Show debacle. I accepted NO EXCUSES and NO GENERALIZED ANSWERS! I threatened them, basically. So Puppet Show is no longer available. For those of you who bought it, ERS is working to fix it and then will bring it out when it is working properly. They tried and brought out another version but it did not fix the problem, and obviously BigFish doesn't seem to be on their case to fix it! So don't worry about it for now! On to Phantasmat. I was concerned about playing it because the subject matter (murdering family and using their remains, such as bones and ashes, in their artistic endeavors) is truly gruesome and macabre! This game is not for children! When I played it, it was such a fantastic game that I felt the same way as both Dracyy and Izzyoc. The storyline held my interest. There are 3 difficulty settings, although there is no option to customize the settings. It was a decently long game and had a bonus adventure. The graphics were eerily gorgeous and very crisp and clear. The cut-scenes were chilling and quite frightening! At each location you collect a rocking horse and at some you collect a morphing object, and there is an indicator which tells you when you have them. The morphing collectibles allow you to access portfolios of the Ward family. There were many locations and loading WAS instantaneous (for a change) between locations! There is an in-game marked (dependent on settings) teleport map to use. You learn the story via notes, and objectives were regularly updated. Inventory is labeled and interactive and there are complex items to assemble. The HO scenes had variation, and if you preferred not to play the scene you could play match-3 instead. I actually enjoyed the puzzles in this game; there were some new ones and they weren't only boring rotational junk! My actual rating is 4.5 stars, and I deducted half a star due to lack of a cohesive journal. The game ran smoothly and I did not encounter any glitches. This game was extremely clever and I enjoyed it immensely. I even bravely fed the mouse and thought that it was kind of cute (EIPIX did not torture me too much!) Of course I will deny EVER saying a mouse was cute, lol! Lynxie sends lots of ❤️💋😘 to the intrepid, fabulous and hard-working Dream Team Elite! Keep up the great work, and please also keep pestering BigFish to get Puppet Show updated. The more we annoy them, the more pressure they will have to do it! I cannot do it alone, although I really have tried! Please Dracyy, KimTwilight, Izzyoc, Opinion, Sunshine Susie, Deana M and Catalina, keep sending nasty emails to BigFish. A lot of people bought the game and it is unplayable! What will it take for ERS to finally update it?"
"14199",1142348885,"It's downright evil. Sad. Depressing."
"14200",1142366464,"Don’t buy it I hate it i got it cuz I love spongebob I thought he was my bf but I got the game and it sucked so bad theres nothing to do don’t buy it it’s a scam"
"14201",1142366464,"I thought this game was that you get to be in a spongebob Minecraft world but it was not and I think it is the worse please make the game better and don’t buy the game!!!!!!!!!"
"14202",1142366464,"This cheep knock off is not even a mod! You fling spongebob and his friends to the right. In my book that just spelled out B O R I N G !"
"14203",1142385805,"Good game. It reminds me of NiGHTS, and Yoshi's Island. Nice idea, cool gameplay. Challenging but fun. My biggest gripes are the abundance of ads, and the child. Let me explain. This game is like Yoshi's island in that if you're damaged, a ""child"" that is riding you gets thrown off, with a ten second timer to retrieve it. This would be fine, if the child was not constantly thrown ABOVE the screen, where you can't reach it. Once you go above-screen, however, it will throw you downwards, meaning you have even less of a chance. Another issue, though less pronounced, is that your power up will deactivate and immediately leave you exposed to the enemies were about to run into. At least there could be a few safety frames before being fed to the dogs?  Edit: Controls really aren't a problem. Hold the screen, you spin in one direction. Let go, spin in the other. Tap over and over, you'll go straight. It's simple unless you have such a bad sense of timing that you overshoot where you need to go. I have had very little problem with controls.  TL;DR, Many little glitches woven into a good idea. This if a complicated recommend, but if you're interested in playing the game, knock yourself out."
"14204",1142385805,"Controls are bad. Game wasn't that good to begin with but I like it a bit. I would expect more from padoga west. Cuz these are the developers of sonic mania here!"
"14205",1142385805,"Though it's not my favorite kind of game (the controls are a bit complicated—not my favorite), the picture/look of it, the color quality and the graphics are BEAUTIFUL! Great job!! I will definitely look for more of these amazing quality graphics games!"
"14206",1142578941,"Been playing this game for a couple of years now. Really fun and mindless entertainment. However, level 711 only gives you 2 moves! What’s up with that?? There’s no way to beat this level unless you buy a lot of moves. So I guess this is the end of the game for me..."
"14207",1142578941,"Level 711 allows only two moves?  Impossible with out buying a bunch of extra moves."
"14208",1142578941,"Love this Game omg stress free game"
"14209",1142657936,"Name is Spoofr but spoof it does not! Trail mapper would be more apt. It does NOT spoof your location so do not buy it for that."
"14210",1142657936,"Have to download a program on your computer and that process can take over an hour. Than you get nothing but error messages once you try to use it. Waste of money. Just emailed them for a full refund."
"14211",1142657936,"I just bought this app cause the pictures make it look easy then when you try to use it you discover a 15 set set up. Most of the sets involve setting up another app you have to get to make this one work. To top it all off I can't even find and English version of the app for iPhone which was what I bought this app for... So basicly I spent money to just delete this app and look for another... Thank you for that!!"
"14212",1142717730,"I loved the first two Cadenza games - great animation and music, and fun puzzles - but this one didn't do it for me. As others have mentioned, much too short. I only got a couple of hours of play out of the game and the bonus. Second, I didn't care for the mini-puzzles - either very same old, same old (shove the tiles around to make a picture), or too arcade-style for my taste, with an emphasis on fast reflexes more than being able to figure it out. Great voice acting and animation, but I'm really disappointed in the lack of imagination with this one."
"14213",1142717730,"Been playing these games for a while now and while many have a plot that is disjointed and have you running back and forth from screen 6 to screen 2 and back again, this one flows beautifully with a plot that makes you feel like you are part of the game. Good for all levels, mostly family friendly, as in no demons and such, but you do have to sucker punch someone and threaten with a gun.  No overt violence, and in the end, love wins. The music was not too ""jazzy"" (not a big fan), some mystery type music is thrown in, and a couple side things you can do while you're playing. Length of game is also good. A thoroughly enjoyable time!"
"14214",1142717730,"Great graphics, realistic. Plays like a real relatable story did not want it to end."

"14218",1142803226,"I was looking for an app to make cool animated pictures. It does that for the most part, but the pictures end up turning out blurry and not high quality at all. I wish there was a way to adjust how much of the filter you want to put on one picture. I was also kind of disappointed with the lack of other filters they had and the ability to adjust those. Was it worth $2 not really!"
"14219",1142803226,"Not worth 1 star or the money. Effects are not how they show 👎🏽"
"14220",1142803226,"This app is so fun. I am able to create art of any photo or create real time! It’s easy and addictive. I’m sharing this with everyone."
"14221",1143052259,"Very Detailed game , not so many ad breaks that it drive u crazy addictive game...."
"14222",1143052259,"I love it."
"14223",1143052259,"Exciting and fun game, I certainly rate this game 10/10"
"14224",1143258387,"The ads kill the game, it could be a decent little game but the ads make it terrible! I will never buy OT download anything from an ad ever! Removed them please. And no I will not pay to remove ads the game is not that good"
"14225",1143258387,"Difficult and not fun"
"14226",1143258387,"About once a minute, full screen ads that mimic other games appear, and can't be dismissed for several seconds. My kids got very frustrated at accidentally getting sent to the App Store over and over. Deleted immediately."
"14227",1143689829,"I can’t even complete a face and the app closes and anything I have done is gone. $.99?? For what?? It’s garbage"
"14228",1143689829,"Half of these faces and eyes etc don’t even look like me I try and try to adjust and I just can’t get right so I deleted it."
"14229",1143689829,"1)Does not let you make a copy, so if you get an emoji looking like someone just right but just want to change a feature (i.e holiday hat, etc) you have to create the emoji from scratch; 2) Developer does not answer emails; 3) App not updated in over a year"
"14230",1144018570,"Even after a year of a review this developer has not tried to fix the problem with the ads issue. Do not download if you don’t wanna have to watch a ad every 3 seconds."
"14231",1144018570,"Would be fun if I wasn’t watching an ad before I even got to play it once. Literally every time you fail you have to watch an extremely long ad."
"14232",1144018570,"I downloaded the game and pressed the screen to play like it said. It went straight to an ad. Not worth it for a second."
"14233",1144154105,"Beautiful but ridiculously frustrating and tedious. Touching any part of pretty much anything besides the level gate kills your character. Made it to level 2 and decided it wasn't worth the time."
"14234",1144154105,"This game is an undersea challenge in which you control your jellyfish character through dangerous caverns to reach keys that unlock higher levels, while collecting gems along the way. The game has potential to be an enjoyable little title, but has several issues hindering its success.  First, the intro to the game is a non-interactive animation.  You're visually shown what to do in the game, where instead you should be prompted to try the controls, and get a feel for the gameplay.  Once the animation is done, you're thrown into the first level with tap left/right instructions, and left to explore the level.  Normally, this type of introduction could work, but the one-life/start-over gameplay leads to frustration.  The level design suffers from what has been described in other reviews: the beginning stages are particularly difficult, taking numerous attempts to complete what should be simple, easy goals to build player confidence.  After your character (repeatedly) braves spiky walls to reach the level goal, you're presented with a key contained in smooth-looking semicircular ring, which you might expect to be a haven after all the effort required to reach that point.  But no, touch any part of the ring and it's start over (again).  It could make sense to add this level of difficulty at higher levels and introduce an additional challenge, but including this behavior in the first levels is a recipe for game deletion for all but the most dedicated players.  Enabling the character to take up three hits before having to start over would at least allow some planning to complete the level.  In terms of style, the game sports well-designed visuals, and the cute jellyfish character responds with the appropriate physics behavior.  The dubstep soundtrack isn't bad, but seems out of place given the undersea setting and the floating, undulating movement of your jellyfish.  Speaking of the character, you will unlock different jellyfish as you progress, but it's not clear whether the characters have any significantly different abilities, or are just style upgrades.  As it stands, Slip Away Mystify is fairly daunting out the gate and will likely appeal only to those seeking high difficulty challenges. Hopefully the developers can rethink the gameplay and level progression, but in its current state, it's difficult to recommend."
"14235",1144154105,"Too difficult. Fun for the first few levels. No check points so prepare to restart levels constantly. Not worth the money at all."
"14236",1144164707,"There isn’t any enemy variety and there should be some team abilities like in miitopia that I thought was a awesome detail.And there should be a WAR MACHINES like the bilista,catipalt,cannon,goloms,and lastly the legend told even to day the demon of the sky a dragon. Oh and more heroes and villains.Plus being able to buy or earn different weapons and armors for buffs and the armor would make your heroes/villains have more verity and to look cool.For example the swords would have strangeths and weakenesses.Like smaller swords would swing faster but do less damage or DPS,and heavier swords would do lots of damage but would take longer to swing.And if your lucky you can get weapons that have spells that could freeze enemies,or burn,splash damage,+5%gem chance,and if your wizard is a high enough level he could confuse enemies to attack there own team. Well this has been a fine dandy time but I have no more complaints for this game and add caricature interactions and friendship levels witch would effect your game play! Good bye all I’m out!!! Peace!"
"14237",1144164707,"The game is okay but I would like some more conversations. The game is addictive but it just keeps repeating over and over all the time when you prestige."
"14238",1144164707,"I’ve played this game for quite a while after it launches, but then quit for a little bit.  It is a lot of fun and had a solid progression system, but after a few prestige resets it started getting too repetitive.  I have recently started playing some more on a regular basis and it is still pretty fun and a good idle time waster.  I also really enjoy the silly banter the characters talk to each other.   If you like idle progression games, give this a try."
"14239",1144247611,"Might be a decent game if it wasn’t for so many freaking ads. But as it is now, it wears thin super quickly. Uninstalled."
"14240",1144247611,"It was a fun game until it stoped working"
"14241",1144247611,"I've been waiting for a game like this M.A.G.A 🇺🇸"
"14242",1144422536,"THIS GAME IS STILL AMAZING!!!! But it needs an update to get the ads to work for coins- and for the cloud to work...   AND IN THE UPDATE -IT WOULD REALLY HELP TO SEE THE ACHIEVEMENT LIST Like “Hold three rubber duckies at once and get a prize”- AND MAYBE EXPAND THAT LIST- Ski safari made a MINT and an INFINITELY playable set of games doing just that- so I can replay to get achievements and use those to level up my stuff...  PLEASE CONSIDER AN UPDATE- I know you have the newer dolphin version- And That’s GREAT TOO- But this one can STAND ON ITS OWN as a Really Great Game... I WANT TO KEEP THEM BOTH- Please Consider..."

"14244",1144422536,"Loved the first game on the windows phone and I want to love this one. But it’s frustrating when you get to a check point, watch an ad to progress and the game freezes. You have to force quit the app and it messes up the flow of the game. I would pay for no ads in this game."
"14245",1144446958,"Booo!! 👎"
"14246",1144446958,"Don't bother with this game. Period. ...You want to know why I say that? Fine. I was expecting nearly everything to be locked already, but this ""game"" shattered my expectations. For example, when dressing up the girls, it surprised me that the pants section is locked, so no matter what option you pick for the top, your character looks silly. This game needs more content unlocked by default to even make it a good demo. But it seems that this company just cares about milking as much money from parents as possible, so I expect it to stay exactly as is right now."

"14249",1144458512,"I love this app and the simplicity of it but I wish when you edit an event you can customize the location so the date take its account the time zones.

"14260",1145275343,"Yet another update that doesn't fix the game. The game won't even open!!! I paid $10 for this back when it worked. Then after an update it just refused to do anything. I want a refund!"
"14261",1145275343,"I won’t pay another $10 to buy this game because I switched to iPhone. I would appreciate if I could just play with the content I got when I bought the game but alas, all my hard work is locked behind a paywall."
"14262",1145275343,"I wrote a review complaining bc I paid $10 and didn’t get the updates for it but I’m re-writing this because just go click purchase again and instead of buying it again, click “restore purchase” and then you get your updates."

"14269",1145465310,"Let people have Cherry she’s my favorite character on strawberry shortcake and I love it but needs more people please 😃😀😄😁😆"
"14270",1145465310,"ok I love this game but hold on, money people... why do you guys care about money more than our fun? Bacically the hole game cost money money money 💴 I’m sick with app purchases. We only get one world which is New York but nothing else! Purchase this and purchases that uh! Would you mind making things free a little at least one more world please. I’m giving you five stars because I love hair style games. I mean I live with purchases which mean ALL of my game need purchases. I’m begging you for more free stuff"
"14271",1145465310,"Why I love this game is because my sisters love playing this and please don’t hate because we’re sad because we are foster kids and we have been took away from our mom for 2 years straight and my dad doesn’t care and my mom loves us and my mom is not a bad mom she always cared about us so please don’t hate  Please :(🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😗😗😗😗🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺"
"14272",1145485982,"I’m playing on an iPad and iPhone. Level progression saves in iCloud but coins are not saving. One device has lots of coins, the other zero.  I started the game on ipad, then switched to iPhone. FYI-iPhone X, iOS 12.4. & iPad Pro iOS 12.4. Thx!"
"14273",1145485982,"I purchased in app currency and it approved the transaction but then gave me nothing. I’m concerned they just stole my money even after I had to pay for the game in the first place.... contacting apple services to get my money back"
"14274",1145485982,"In app purchases don’t work. I spent 2$ and it showed I had the 2000 coins or skulls or whatever and then it went back down to 0 and restore purchases button does nothing. Very cool game but purchases are broken"
"14275",1145500015,"I would like more cars on the game that you could at least buy with the money you get while playing and from bank robberies"

"14278",1145528262,"It does what others can do and is much like it states about selfies being “OLD” the functions and filters this does is “OLD”.  Moving on to more important things like playing hot wheels with my kiddo rather than playing with a phone."
"14279",1145528262,"Crashes non stop on every apple device I own. Really really bad code, you can even tell from the dev notes they're not professionals that made this app."
"14280",1145528262,"Over all, it is a great game. Their are some minor problems, but it after all is a funny thing to do."
"14281",1145541321,"OMG THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD. Like omg the puzzles in the beginning are fun and super simple but as the boards get bigerr they get much harder. I bet u cannot beat 7 boards on 5x5 for 30 seconds. This game is soooo much better than the original Flow Free. Flow Free Hexes is much better with its sleek design of the hexagonal board. And when I play it at night when my mom and dad think I’m sleeping the dark astatic is soo nice on the eyes and makes it nice and easy to play. My favorite part of the game is the adds that come up when I play. “CAN YOU BEET THIS GAME?!?!?!?!?!?” Adds are sooooooo funny and make me die every time Best game on the App Store!!!! I recommend to anyone who has played any of the other three in the series!!!!!!"
"14282",1145541321,"My 4 1/2 year old grandson works the puzzles and we have match offs! I don’t let him win but he has worked a couple I had trouble with."
"14283",1145541321,"I love Flow Free and this version does not disappoint."
"14284",1145602670,"No instructions, annoying music, not fun."
"14285",1145602670,"This game is an eye candy... As simple as it is, looks just amazing in the Apple TV! Now, the gameplay is a little confusing, even though the controllers are very responsive, the game itself is a little simple and repetitive... Played it for a few minutes, but didnt get hooked."
"14286",1145602670,"This game is crazy yet highly enticing one. Opening the app felt weird and hypnotizing due to the sound effect and black and weird background. The gameplay however is really addictive, balancing as many people as you can . You really have to concentrate to proceed further in this game as the challenges are interesting and also difficult. The balancing meter holds key the proceed further, concentrate on your balancing meter."
"14287",1145738671,"Best"
"14288",1145738671,"Yeeeeet"
"14289",1145738671,"More levels plz fix bugs."
"14290",1145823552,"The optimization for iPhone XS is completely broken, annoying to play because of this."
"14291",1145823552,"Excellent puzzle city building strategy game.great presentation.worth the money"
"14292",1145823552,"Really engaging game with brilliant AI. HOWEVER, that AI is way too slow. There's one piece where you need to play in a four player versus game. Waiting for the others to ""take their turns"" is just as annoying as waiting for humans to play. It takes so long, my iPad tries to sleep while I wait, even with the speed set to turbo. Three times I've played before bed and fallen asleep waiting for that particular board to play out. Other than that, it's truly a great, challenging game that's worth the money."
"14293",1145877280,"I saw the picture it looked so fun but it was the worst game I’ve played in my life it’s so boring whoever buys this game it will be so boring  I want a refund 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"14294",1145877280,"THIS GAME SO STUPID!picture don’t means anything!this game so BORING!!!i thinked it was real fnaf in minecraft!"
"14295",1145877280,"The game looks like five nights at Freddy‘s in Minecraft why did you make it so so so boring!?"
"14296",1145920150,"There were two levels in particular that took me literal weeks to figure out. 99 and the other was 72 or 49 or something idk they were SO hard. But so rewarding. Definitely play this game if you’re into flow, unblock me, Black, snappers, etc."
"14297",1145920150,"There is no trial of the game so you have to buy to play. Once you pass the tutorial there is no help or advise on how to play good luck getting past level 5.  Had to delete the game and throw away that money. So sorry I bought the game. HATE THIS GAME IT IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS NO INSTRUCTIONS AND IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS LEVEL 5+ Please refund my money"
"14298",1145920150,"As soon as I get almost solved, the app freezes. Has happened on the same puzzle three times. I really do not want to do that puzzle yet again. I will wait a bit for an update and if it isn’t fixed, I will uninstall,  I guess. It is a shame, but it is pointless to keep having it freeze two moves from completion."
"14299",1146128499,"I absolutely love this game EXCEPT, when I go to use endless mode the screen immediately goes black and goes back to the home screen! Is this game not compatible with iPhone XR or something? Anyway I love this game."
"14300",1146128499,"Love it 😊 this app is so much fun my favorite one is rapid you have to play rapid and if you don’t like this app then I Don’t Know 🤷‍♂️ what is wrong with you because this app is so amazingly fun I love this app!"
"14301",1146128499,"I love it so much. It helps relieve my stress."
"14302",1146138135,"I love this game! I love video games, but I’ve been too busy and tired lately to be interested in very many video games. That’s where this game helps. It’s a little challenging and addictive. It’s probably the only game right now that I find is fun and requires low energy/effort."
"14303",1146138135,"Perfect."
"14304",1146138135,"Awesome puzzles"
"14305",1146177222,"Really enjoy figuring out the puzzles. The sound and graphics are indeed soothing. The only problem is that when playing on the iPhone it can be quite difficult to turn the arrows"
"14306",1146177222,"Flud presents challenging puzzles with polished design and animation. Its grid-clearing concept bears some similarities with games like Mr. Square, Fold, and Blip Blup, but features its own unique mechanics.   The puzzles are well-crafted and satisfying to solve, striking a good balance between logical deduction and lateral thinking. The animations provide some nice eye-candy, but they're just slow enough to become an annoyance during play, as the UI stays completely unresponsive until after all the blocks have finished doing their dance. This means waiting several seconds every time you make or undo a move, which quickly grows tiresome as the levels become difficult.   The tiny navigation buttons can be hard to press on smaller devices. I've experienced occasional minor glitches, both with the graphics and placing arrows, but nothing that critically hindered play. The app does seem to use more CPU than necessary, battery drain has been an issue on my device.   However, all of these faults are overshadowed by the quality of the puzzles. Overall, Flud is a fun, challenging puzzler that could benefit from a few under-the-hood refinements to improve the user experience."
"14307",1146177222,"Is there seriously no way to turn off the SUPER annoying sound effects? Idk if I'll even get a chance to find out if I like the game as it bugs me so much. Not amused..."
"14308",1146274176,"I think this game is okay. It's not better than Pokémon go but it's an alternative to those who can't get Pokémon go. Those who are saying this is horrible, well why don't you try making a video game yourself and see if you could do better!"
"14309",1146274176,"stop this game"
"14310",1146274176,"This game is sooo retarded you can't even move if you are looking for a game like Pokémon go get SOMETHING ESLE."
"14311",1146398155,"I love ❤️ this game and its a lot of fun 👍🏻❤️😎😱😱🥳🤩😋😛😘🥰😍🤯🤗💩👍🏻 Yay 😀"
"14312",1146398155,"I thought 💭 I would not have to be the teacher, it was nothing how I thought it would be I don’t even know how to say it but I have no bad feeling about this game:) ♥️but is not as I sespected"
"14313",1146398155,"I do like it a bit 🙂😜🤪bet I father go to bed🛏🛏😴😴"
"14314",1146465836,"Ok"
"14315",1146465836,"Good game"
"14316",1146465836,"Great game to pass the time away. Fun to play"
"14317",1146543227,"Like a lot of people, I assumed that Procreate was the go-to drawing and painting app to use with my Apple pencil. But I really, really hate the way that Procreate handles its pencil brushes (feels totally unnatural to the point where its more frustrating to work with than anything).   This app is infinitely better. Pencils feel like pencils, and when you tilt your pencil to do some shading work, it actually responds the way you'd expect it to (unlike Procreate).   So glad I found this one."
"14318",1146543227,"I love this app it’s so good and plus it’s for free."
"14319",1146543227,"I've been using this app for several years, first on Android and now IOS. I purchased the premium for both and was very happy with what I had. The app got better with every update and I've recommended it to several friends and family. The only problem I've had so far, and recently, (that is of any significance) is that now I can't access the quick tool bar where the paintbrush and eraser, etc, access points are located. What happened was, I recently bought an iPhone XR and I accidentally moved the bar to underneath the slide up panel. It's only half on the screen and no longer accessible...I've tried to move it but the panel is fully covering it. Also, the undo and redo buttons are small and I had a difficult time attempting to use them, I kept tapping marks on my canvas. I hope this gets resolved soon, because unfortunately I'm no longer able to use the program without extreme limitations. Otherwise, this app is amazing and I definitely recommend you download it!"
"14320",1146552070,"So, I downloaded the game since it looked fun.  I spent 1-2 months on my main save getting to league 7 and buying 8 dogs. And guess what happened? The game deleted the save!  My iPad's storage is full, but that is no reason that the game deleted my save.  I hope the developers read this, because if this game keeps deleting saves like that, then its going to fail.  Can't wait to see this game die in a year or two. Maybe sooner."
"14321",1146552070,"Dog Sled Saga is a great game. It has good quality, and I really think you should get it. Only thing, the game freezes sometimes and I have to go back to the main page of my iPad and restart the game. Also, maybe some more dog breeds? Maybe Chiwawa, Pug, etc. Otherwise great game!!!!! Thx"
"14322",1146552070,"Supposedly, if you're children state they are too old for Dog Sled Saga then they are too old for your ""Fortnite church rules"".   While I don't like Fortnite for different reasons, hating Fortnite because it has ""weapons and violence"" in it is a lame way to think. Fortnite is the best and most appropriate ""shooting-game"" if anything. I'm also confused how they have access to Nerf guns if you dislike that too, unless that's already been ""banned"". There are many things a million times more disturbing than Fortnite. Give your poor kids a break and stop trying to act ""hollier than thou"" when in reality you sound like a total nut job and control-freak. Disgusting. 😬"
"14323",1146601414,"Since it’s no longer run by OWN this game is ridiculous. The special games don’t add. Get an error message that I need to connect to the internet. Well, I am. I haven’t played the last several special games series for this reason.  I’ve quit playing and will delete it. Maybe retry in a couple years."
"14324",1146601414,"Love this game but am sorry they have chosen to not continue releasing any more new levels.   Feel it is a unique game among so many that all feel and play the same.  Wish they would change decision to not continue releasing new levels."
"14325",1146601414,"Great game, but I’ve finished level 25 over and over and it won’t let me advance to the next path. The “Help” button is no help at all"
"14326",1146696085,"Don’t know why, have not updated."

"14329",1146828763,"The ads kill what would be a perfect iphone game"
"14330",1146828763,"I have been playing this game for a while, and it is very fun. Just one problem... I have gotten to the point of having only the balls cheese, dirt, basket and eye left. But I had the suspicion that the game was repeating my purchases.  In other words, I received balls I already had. So I saved up about 2000 gems, enough to buy 20 balls, and NONE of the “random” purchases landed on the four balls I didn’t have.  Soooo this should probably be fixed: it’s a problem..."
"14331",1146828763,"This game is so badly made. I trucks you into pressing on the add and then when you close the ad the game just crashes. Please fix this you are ruining the game with poorly designed ads"

"14333",1146971602,"I found a glitch that gave you 10 holocrons when you get 1 or 2 holocrons"
"14334",1146971602,"I’ve had this for about 2 years now and would say that this is the best Star Wars tech experience out there. Very fun for all ages. I would recommend to any Star Wars fan."
"14335",1146991999,"I know this app is rated for babies and toddlers. I'd say that's pretty accurate. For patient children, it would be good too. Not so much for my active 7 year old grandson. While he loves music, the time it takes to get the items to respond is too long for him. I purchased it hoping it would be a good program for him. Not so much. This program should not startle young children. It does play classical music while things slowly move on the screen. The listener controls the action by touching certain items. I did not no which ones to touch, so it is good for exploration."
"14336",1146991999,"My daughter is in love with this app. She can sit for a very long time, playing her favorites over and over. My husband and I are both classical musicians and we love the quality of the recordings and the chosen pieces. Thumbs up!"
"14337",1146991999,"My grandchildren love this app. Every time they are near my iPhone they expect the ""music cartoon"". I can't wait to tell them his name is Tongo. He is already loved, now he is named."

"14341",1147195439,"Bubble island is the best game I have found. It’s fun and a great way to pass the time. Thank you Wooga for making an awesome game💜 I can’t wait for another bubble island"
"14342",1147195439,"Back in 2013 I downloaded this game and loved it, but now I cannot use it well last time I tried because it does not work with voiceover like it used to. People who are visually impaired blind love this game but now I’m about to download it again to see if I can use it if not I wish that this game can be used with voiceover. Thank you for reading"

"14346",1147225129,"Horrible control response time renders this thing unplayable."
"14347",1147297267,"I've played this game off and on for a couple years, but in this version, the graphics are so herky jerky that I get an instant headache from trying to play. It's an iPad Pro, so it's not a lack of horsepower."
"14348",1147297267,"Original don’t starve supports gamepad but this does not. I bought it because who woulda thought a newer game would abandon a key feature"
"14349",1147297267,"Don’t Starve is a great game, and even this DLC is virtually the same as the computer or console versions. However, this DLC only offers one game play mode, when you die, game over, begin again. Considering how long it take to move from island to island I personally feel this penalties is too harsh and prevents me from getting into the game.  Don’t starve app has a no sweat mode, why not this one?  Also I’d appreciate being able to use my Bluetooth controller, I can on Don’t Starve, but not here."
"14350",1147331964,"If you’ve played XCOM2, this game is essentially that, minus the story. It even allows you to customize specifics of your campaign, so you can decide ‘how you want it to be difficult or easy.’ This is good though, especially for mobile.  Its all mostly geared toward info collection and stealth. Hostile encounters are absolute: all shots hit, no one gets a health bar. This forces you carefully set the terms of each encounter ahead of it actually happening (ambushes, hacking, dones, etc.).  Perhaps, my one gripe is its light on info, especially when hacking targets. Its possible to hack something that looks hostile (red), but it doesn't appear to do anything if its not hacked, and doesn’t do anything after its hacked."
"14351",1147331964,"Failing and starting over has been designed into this game, just like Faster Than Light. I call that limited marketing vision. Otherwise, I love this game. It’s just that after about the 5th restart, it’s no longer fun. Just tedious. They’re leaving money on the table with this kind of game design, in my opinion, as not everybody considers countless restarts as enjoyable, especially the paying real money for the pleasure. Plus I don’t care for Desktop ports that are not ‘really’ adopted for iOS. Using the mouse pointer Desktop icons, which are always too small, etc."
"14352",1147331964,"I really love the game. I just wish the game was iphone compatible. Some big strategy titles (such as Rome Total War and Civilizations) recently brought iphone support. Please consider the same. I would even pay again to have this game on my iphone."
"14353",1147424561,"This game is really fun but you guys should make the enemy players faster. Other than that I love it!!!"
"14354",1147424561,"I hate it when whenever I’m trying to download it it always stops and I have to delete everything just but I am adding game I don’t really like it"
"14355",1147424561,"This game has cool skins in all, but they don’t do anything while you are playing. Plus, the players aren’t even fast. SUPER ANNOYING!It is also really hard to aim to another receiver.If you just download this, delete it!Please fix this!!!"
"14356",1147432809,"Tempo control is tough on this because you only have one way... the apps way. Please add link or external tempo control! The more I use gadget and this synth I realize that korg needs to get on the audio unit bandwagon because I hate how taxing gadget can get when you really stack things up. They need to implement track freezing in that too! It would be great wouldn’t it. 🤪 As far as my review for this synth goes, it’s got awesome arpeggios and oscillators, but all the cool stuff is in the apps presets that sadly don’t get included in the gadget presets. Pick up an arpeggiator app like StepPolyArp or Rozeta sequencer suite and Aum until midi clock in is supported!"
"14357",1147432809,"Great sounding synth with sequencer for live use, but it’s not AUv3, which would allow me to record Midi into my favorite iOS Daw. It’s InterApp Audio though. Love the sequencer, great for lead sounds."
"14358",1147432809,"I play the bass so I’ve got an ear for a really good sounding bass …this particular device gives me a lot to choose from …as far as different tones and I don’t get calluses on my fingers I love it ha ha ha ha I just love it"
"14359",1147452760,"I love all Easy Tech Titles thoroughly and this is one of my favorites. The ability to bring generals through different eras is spectacular and I love the concept. The difficulty does get ridiculous (I’m in the Discovery Age), but the game is fun nonetheless. Thank you Easy tech for adding support for the latest IOS devices. I was pleasantly surprised to see the full screen be used."
"14360",1147452760,"I love this game so much and I’m now playing it everyday but I’m stuck on the 1ST Joan of Arc level. It’s basically impossible since the English archer men with generals do 1000 dmg. Even if I use the George Washington guy I bought it’s still impossible to win for me."
"14361",1147452760,"My only problems are that some of the games take forever to be honest I don’t think I finished a conquest just because they take forever. I would play this game a lot more if all the conquests will unlocked at the beginning of the game. Just like a lot of your games you have to complete the hole campaign just to do the conquests but in my opinion it’s still a fun game."
"14362",1147863312,"Tried to run game 4 times on iPhone 6 - app would close. What a game-huh?"

"14371",1148046351,"Crashes often, but what I found unacceptable is they don't include Pluto in our solar system and I'll be darned if I will allow my kids to be taught wrong information.  Neptune is not the furthest planet in our solar system."
"14372",1148046351,"I've deleted and downloaded this app three times to see if it would fix itself, but it doesn't. It crashes every time you push a button to learn more about a planet. Our iPad is even running iOS 9.3.3 and the specs say you only need iOS 8 or later. I will be asking for my money back."
"14373",1148046351,"I downloaded this game for my 6yr old son.  App downloads fine, but crashes EVERYTIME it opens and renders app useless.  Very frustrating for a 6 yr old.  Don't waste your time or money!"
"14374",1148047801,"I played (and continue to play) Siralim 1 and had a blast with it; one of the things I really appreciated was that it's one of the few in-depth games my old iPad can run without any problems. Needless to say I was psyched about this game, especially because it looks like they fleshed out the spellcasting system a lot (creatures can cast spells now with indvidual stats, and you don't have to worry about running out of charges on your best scroll and having to search for more scrolls once that happens) and made character class have more of an impact-- not to mention the various quirky gods (the god of anger who always cusses at you might be my favorite so far, though it's a close call between him and the creepy/flirty spider goddess of poison). However, one problem: the game has a very annoying tendency to crash when someone (either me or my opponent) casts a spell in combat. I'm still giving it 3 stars because it looks like they tried to take some measures to fix it, with options letting the game run more smoothly on lower-quality devices, and it's nice that they're showing consideration for players like me who don't have the newest devices; also, it seems like it would be a lot of fun if it didn't do that every time. Maybe add an option kind of like Turbo Mode but that only disables spell graphics or something, not all combat information? I don't know. Looking forward to playing this when they get the bugs ironed out."
"14375",1148047801,"I love this game a lot, had 100+ hours on my main save before I took a break for a while. Now that I’m finally getting back into it, I can’t remember what it was I was working on with my builds and such since I didn’t bother to record my plans anywhere...  It’s super fun to plow through levels while earning more reputation with the various Gods, at least, though I also don’t remember who I really needed to rank up and what items or materials I really needed to get to unlock further bonus features and such. :P  All I know is that I can slaughter the enemies in Daily Realms and everything no problem, but with the sigils, it tends to be the exact opposite, lol. And the last Task in my current set for the fortune teller requires me to beat a level 5+ Primal sigils... (I had to check the library to remember what Tasks were and a bunch of other stuff, so I’m thankful that’s there, maybe I need to read more of that to figure out more strategies and stuff, or just start putting more time into one of my NG+ saves with some of the “cheats” active to help me out a bit more, lol.)"
"14376",1148047801,"Such an awesome game. I rarely find a game I can put that much time in to... I put about the same amount of time in to the first one. Can't wait for siralim 3 for iOS!!!"
"14377",1148053146,"This game is so cool I love the graphics and the controls are spot on. It’s also a real challenge which is rare to find in an adventure game. It’s like Mario and Undertale combined!"
"14378",1148053146,"iPhone X controls are too close to the edge of the screen"
"14379",1148053146,"When I started playing this it was fun at first but after awhile sometimes I have to take rage quits."
"14380",1148119410,"After playing Taylor’s three adventures this one is kind of a let down. The main character is quite unlikable and it doesn’t always follow your choices so it seems like the story is taking you where it wants instead of you choosing the path. The story is interesting but since the character annoys the heck out of you, you find yourself ignoring it."
"14381",1148119410,"The story twists and turns in many unexpected ways and is what makes this such a great app. I would definitely recommend this app. The millions of paths can be reviled with a simple click of a button."
"14382",1148119410,"I love these games but now that I have the series 4 Apple Watch this doesn’t even work it just says launch app on iPhone to start I’ve tried deleting and redownloading but nothing’s working please fix I just paid for this. And these games are amazing"
"14383",1148138918,"Truly original storyline. A little rough to follow I have to be honest. I have played thousands of these games so finding an original storyline gets big props even if it is a little strange and tough to follow at times. This game at least sticks out of the pack and I will remember it. I do like that, so I would recommend it on that fact alone."
"14384",1148138918,"Unlike most of the games, this one is worth the cost.  Challenging mini games, long enough to feel like it is worth the cost."
"14385",1148138918,"Hi, Izzyoc! I wish I had seen your review but today our XFinity was down for 5 hours so TV was out of the question! I have nothing else new to play so I guess for the price I'll try it. By the way, do you have any idea when some of the games you listed will be released for iPad? I can't wait for a new Expedition; it's one of my favorites. Thank you so much for all of your input! I actually liked this game a lot more than I thought! First of all, you could customize the settings. Orneon actually gives us a journal, a feature sorely lacking by other developers. The game was lengthy, with a bonus adventure. The storyline wasn't overly complicated, or even really unusual. Still I liked it because I had no trouble following it. Objectives were regularly updated.The graphics were incredibly colorful and gorgeous, and the cut-scenes were electrifying, especially when you use the magic lamp and enter the time portal. Loading was instantaneous between locations and and there was a marked, if so customized, teleport map to transport you. There was no map in the bonus adventure, but I don't know why that was the case. Inventory was labeled and interactive. There was a lot to do at each location. You also had a neat device to use to dispel evil magic. Collectibles included flowers and morphing objects. The HO scenes had variation and some were more like puzzles. The puzzles/mini-games were diverse: there was some boring rotational stuff, some games of skill, some coding puzzles, but at least there were many puzzles and there was something for everyone. I was very happy not to deal with any major rodents! Thank you, Dracyy! I deducted a star for the following reasons: I found that some of the puzzles were very hard to manipulate, although the game ran smoothly otherwise. I didn't like the hint system because it was a spoiler. Lastly, with such magnificent graphics, we were not given any gorgeous wallpapers in the extras section, and I would have loved them! This was still a good game and I would definitely enjoy another sequel. I would like to say Happy Thanksgiving to the entire DTE and the other gamers/reviewers as well! Lynxie sends 💋❤️😘 to all!"
"14386",1148177808,"When i got the app i couldnt watch it and when i tried joining fans everything went gray.i would have picked 1 star but i didn’t feel like it so i put 2 stars"
"14387",1148177808,"This is a really good idea, but I would like to see all or at least most of the games on the fox sports go app, specifically NFL, MLB, and NHL. If you can include that, I would gladly rate it a 5 star. Please make this update fox sports!!!!"
"14388",1148177808,"The app overall is wonderful. It works well with and without a cardboard headset. However there needs to be a bigger variety in sports and more current games. A way to show more interesting topics is by allowing us to choose our teams that we want to watch. If these all happen I’d without a doubt give this an instant five stars"
"14389",1148229094,"Es bueno, pero quisiera utilizarlo para subirlo a snapchat como si fuera un emoji pero cuando quiero poner varios en solo 1 foto solo me da la opción de subir el emoji como una IMAGEN. :("
"14390",1148229094,"Baje hace poco la app y cuando añado el Burbumoji al keyboard, se pone súper lento y no funciona. Tuve que eliminarlo y dejé la app instalada."
"14391",1148229094,"Not so good of an app."
"14392",1148320769,"Deer ketchup the first time I had ever got the game I could describe one thing and this game is really really addictive and so much fun and you can earn new characters and even earn some coins and you can even see how many levels do you have and how many scores do have and this game is the best game ever and I can stop playing this game and it’s really addicting it’s i could play this game all day long if I want to play this game all day in my hollow in tiered life and I can even play this game even when on my Christmas break to Mexico and I can play this every where I go and even when I’m bored and when I am back home from Mexico to my family and I can ply this game when I am bored at Mexico and it’s really really fun and it’s cool hands down it’s the best game ever and you can play and pick your own characters and and even when someone characters by playing and get more points and think you ketchup for jacking this game the best game ever and in the morning it’s going to be fun tennis game and thank you again for making this fun and addicting thank you again you’re really the best at making game like this one"
"14393",1148320769,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"14394",1148320769,"It was very very good game"
"14395",1148321705,"Awesome game really brings back a lot of memories"
"14396",1148321705,"Best game first I played it in ps2 and that was great and now it is on phones so play it guys it's the best"
"14397",1148321705,"Played this game years back first on ps2,then on the Xbox 360, been my favorite game ever since. Nothing has ever even compared to bully. Now I’m able to play my favorite game on the go on the phone! Never thought I’d see the day were our technology has advanced so much that we can now play console games on our phones. I remember thinking this years back that I wish I could play bully always on the go, and now here we are and we can! Thanks rockstar for making such an awesome game available on the mobile format!!! 5 Stars!!!"
"14398",1148362520,"This is pretty much on par with what I would expect from Killary Clinton and her bunch of sinners.  Great app!"
"14399",1148362520,"If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. Definitely a solid 5/7"
"14400",1148362520,"It looks like they went back and sharpened all the graphics. The gameplay is even smoother and the added ability to post to Facebook is awesome. I love this game! Ya gotta hide it!"
"14401",1148364175,"This app is a HUGE life saver for my Business! I use it daily...UP UNTIL THE LAST 11 days. Our prices have changed for our products BUT the app hasn't updated. SUPER disappointing"
"14402",1148364175,"Great app overall but the zipcodes for 93065 is incorrect. I pay $1.99 per month for zipcodes and I found few wrong ones already. Also, Can you add $45 kit to new consultant category, similar to what you have for new PC. Thanks so much!!"
"14403",1148364175,"This is the worst app I’ve ever used. When touching the options, I have to tap about 1/2 inch above the actual tab I need. Today, I cannot even select a state and it keeps asking me to purchase the zip code for an extra 20.00. I’d like a full refund on this app. I’ve tried the support tab and I get redirected to Facebook."
"14404",1148587239,"I give this one star because I cannot play the game anymore.  I go into the app and it automatically freezes and doesn’t unfreeze. I use yo give this app 5 stars neutrality this changed my mind. The school bus doesn’t even come Anymore . Can you guys fix my problems?"
"14405",1148587239,"Awesome!"
"14406",1148587239,"I love playing My Town Preschool because it is so so much fun.I LOVE IT."
"14407",1148979232,"This app will display ads that will sow in appropriate images. Clicking on the ads will lead your child to a click bait rabbit hole filled with deeper and deeper debauchery.   Great job developers!"
"14408",1148979232,"It’s amazing to see when a developer and his/her team makes an adorable, challenging, non-cliche game.  There’s plenty of games that copy the original, but you guys, just made something completely new! I don’t see anyone copying you guys!  You all serve good challenges! (Lets hope in World A I pass lvl. 8 :3) All you characters are adorable, and the physics are pretty lit!  The best part?  You all keep things nice and simple, it’s not too dull, neither is it too complex.  It’s like you made the perfect porridge for Goldilocks! (Lets call her Saorilocks!)  I enjoy playing this game, and will always play.  You have my thumbs up if I were decide you to be game of the year!"
"14409",1148979232,"This game is awesome And i love it.period"
"14410",1149330452,"Waw"
"14411",1149330452,"Hard to stop playing."
"14412",1149330452,"Great getaway but I don’t understand all the extra features. Not sure how all the tools work either."
"14413",1149338810,"Some clearly wrong answers and you need to know most conventions.  A lot of conventions are great for experienced players/partnerships.  But if you're that, you don't need the app."
"14414",1149338810,"I agree that this is a good way to learn, but there are errors in the quizzes , and the answer does depend on unknown systems occasionally. Good to do the quizzes with a partner. That way both of you understand the lesson."
"14415",1149338810,"I'm not getting anything out of this. I'm never right and don't understand the logic in the answers given"
"14416",1149476118,"Tried over and over again with Wi-Fi and without. It will not load and I have the latest version of iPhone and it still won’t load."
"14417",1149476118,"Game was ok, but very short, not worth the price."
"14418",1149476118,"The game is refusing to give me a hint beyond telling me which room to be in, after escaping the locked cell in the jail. I have exhausted what I know to do there, so I am wondering if there is a bug? Loved it up to this point."
"14419",1149479233,"Game stops in chapter 2, the garland will not become usable once it is untangled. Unable to acquire the hot coals that are needed to thaw door in chapter 2.  Game needs to be fixed"
"14420",1149479233,"It’s a warm and charming game. Beautiful setting. Takes you back to what the real meaning of Christmas is. I enjoyed it very much."
"14421",1149479233,"Update: 12/21/18 Merry Christmas everyone! If you want to play a new game, themed for the holidays, play Christmas Spirit: Mother Goose, a great buy at$2.99 and appropriate for the entire family! In addition, Domini Games plans on porting new games to iOS in the upcoming year. Sign up for their newsletter! This game was adorable and colorful. It was a cute, sentimental story. The game played well, and glitches which had been reported were addressed and fixed. I deducted a star only for length and for the game being a bit simplistic.  Lynxie sends warm New Year wishes your way!"
"14422",1149500619,"This is a relaxing and addicting game. The music is absolutely head ache relieving ✌🏼️"
"14423",1149500619,"Unique, original and well done over all. Perhaps one improvement would be an easy mode which forgives one mistake but that's nitpicking.  Nice job!!"
"14424",1149500619,"The app asks you to rate the game. If you choose 3 or less stars it does nothing. 4 or more and it sends you to the App Store. I thought Apple banned this practice. Consider rating the game 1 star until they change this unethical review fixing practice."
"14425",1149845877,"This game is the epiphany of entertaining"
"14426",1149845877,"I love killing time with this game. It’s beautiful, simple, and addicting. I gladly paid $2 to remove ads. Well, this was all true a year ago when I was on an iPhone 7 Plus. My experience on my iPhone X has greatly diminished. With no application updates in a year and Apple’s upcoming deadline to update for iPhone X aspect, are there plans to offer continued support and updates for this app?"
"14427",1149845877,"I wish I can storage my data on iCloud in my iPhone, so I can synchronize with my iPad, cuz I have almost all the rocket unlocked on my iPhone and on my iPad there are all blocked 😪😣"
"14428",1149994032,"I have paid for the subscription for this app so there is NO reason why I can’t edit my photos on it. The app crashes almost as soon as I start editing my photos. I cannot even use this app now. FIX THIS BUG BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO USE IT AND PAYING FOR IT!!!"
"14429",1149994032,"I signed up for a free three day trial because it immediately prompted this on the app to utilize it from what I could see. Upon attempting the app I hate it. I do not want to end up being charged for something I will never use again. Canceling should be made easier!! Help!!!"
"14430",1149994032,"Dumb"
"14431",1150132840,"App won’t work. Just shows a blank keyboard. Yes I have allowed full access and redownloaded it multiple times."
"14432",1150132840,"It use to work. Now all the beetmojis are gone. I want my beetmojis back."
"14433",1150132840,"Please add more Beetmoji’s. Best emojis but I need more."
"14434",1150346397,"I understand you need to make money off ads. Simply just make them easier to close. They don’t want to or even have the power to download the game your trying to force upon a child under 5."
"14435",1150346397,"It used to be fun but I had to turn off the game and delete all of the babybus games after I was interrupted by a word cookies ad. This is a kids game. Kids games don’t have ads. If my reader isn’t careful and gets the game, he or she will get a violent ad like mobile strike. I can’t escape those ads. Is outfit7 working with you? Outfit7 has inappropriate ads and hackers. Don’t get it."
"14436",1150346397,"Was my child’s favorite app… This recent update has killed it. He’s now having to spend hundreds of tickets to unlock games he could previously play?? Ridiculous."
"14437",1150735504,"Very polished. Goes way beyond ""just sliding"" by implementing all kinds of mechanics that really make this puzzle game very interesting to play. The eyeballs are particularly terrific!"
"14438",1150735504,"This is so easy yet can drive you nuts with its difficulty.  Love this game...."
"14439",1150735504,"I'm stuck on level 19"
"14440",1150901618,"I have perfect internet but they put you with people from all around the world so they like hard or you like hard and they kill you instantly even when you’re inside your color it’s very buggy and not fun if you’re actually trying to get first place you will just get beaten by an idiot that has better Internet than you even though my Internet is perfect it’s just buggy the game is trash I would suggest downloading another game that is just like this one but is it like you like this one this game is actually trash because they don’t fix the lag with other people around the world so like I was at 76,000 squares but someone killed me inside of my own color because their latency is better than mine"
"14441",1150901618,"I think s couple cool additions for Splix would be, if after you die you can watch the person who killed you and if the more blocks captured you have when you die, the killer gets more than 500"
"14442",1150901618,"The glitches are getting worse and too many hacks that think they are actually good at the game."
"14443",1151108516,"Please keep making these, my grandson and myself find them very entertaining,"
"14444",1151108516,"Very nice, though in my opinion I wish it had more adventure to it."
"14445",1151108516,"Without a doubt one of the best storybooks for kids on ipad. Absolutely fantastic app! The whole feel, the music, the graphics are exactly what you want from it."

"14454",1151423446,"Playing against bots is BORING nothing compared to the online mode that was previously offered. I will be deleting the app. -CHAMBER"
"14455",1151455384,"I literally loved this game. I’ve bought all the additional levels and challenged myself over and over getting though each “land”. But it seems like with every new update the challenge is taken out of the game. It’s made easier, which is an insult to our intelligence and takes the incentive out of continued play. Why would I keep coming back to a game that was easy to win? Maybe, if you must make it less challenging(for whatever reason) keep the “harder” version as an option? Otherwise I’m afraid this will become another game that gets deleted."
"14456",1151455384,"I love this game! I just wish you would add new levels. I’ve conquered every level with three stars and I love it so much I keep replaying them. But new challenges would be wonderful!!"

The moral of the story is, if you you don't like the food, eat out of the trash."

You could do really well and then it stops working-close the game and reload, try again...for the 10th time or more.  My advice, don’t bother! You will find yourself frustrated a lot. Find something else."

"14492",1152607698,"Like the other game I liked . Frustrating and addictive."
"14493",1152607698,"For the first few levels, I thought this was a great game, totally worth the $.99 in app purchase to get rid of ads. But then, the developer made several typical mistakes that made me drastically lower my rating and eventually delete the game.  First after maybe 20 minutes of easy levels suddenly becomes impossible. It could get much too hard, and playing the same level, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again it’s tedious, not fun. And then it gets even worse, as even if you played over and over that many times they’re just not solvable. Soon I discovered why this was…  I tried tapping on the next level, since there was a level that I clearly was never going to get past even if I replayed it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again 1 million times, and I was told I had to watch three videos to get to play the next level. Well, having paid money for the game, I object to having to watch videos, especially several of them in a row, but in this case I said OK.  Well, here the developer got greedy, because I watched a video after video after video, way more than 3, and it wouldn’t ever let me play that next level. After watching seven videos I gave up and deleted the app. Giving 2 stars instead of one because I did have about 15 minutes of fun playing it. Too bad the developer blew it... this could’ve been really great, five star game."
"14494",1152611696,"Colors are very true."
"14495",1152611696,"love it"
"14496",1152611696,"Very little amount of wallpapers and there are free apps that do the same thing as this paid app."
"14497",1152657123,"This app has so much potential to be great but it is constantly glitching and is very hard to navigate. I personally think there are better period trackers out there. I have to delete this app and redownload it about every 2 months because it stops working."
"14498",1152657123,"I had read reviews about all the bugs and glitches, but gave the app a chance anyway. It was great at first, but eventually, just like other reviews stated, it stopped working. I can’t log any symptoms and it does not predict my cycle accurately. Not even close. The only thing I can do with it now is mark the start and end date of my period, but I can also do that on any regular calendar. Not sure what I paid for if it doesn’t even work. Disappointed."
"14499",1152657123,"It annoys me that I paid for this app yet it continually tracks my period wrong. My cycle is almost exactly 4 weeks on the dot every month. All of a sudden it shows my cycle as being 3 weeks long. Extremely unhelpful when trying to track ovulation or anything really."
"14500",1153025759,"THIS IS A GOOD’CHALLENGING’FUN’BRAIN HELPING GAME WHERE U CAN LEARN HOW TO DO PUZZLES I GIVE YOUNA FIVE STAR RATING"
"14501",1153025759,"Very good"
"14502",1153025759,"Cool"
"14503",1153028211,"These demon rise games beat almost every other tbs game. Freemium, one time, and one time with in app purchases.  If you min/max you will have to raise the difficulty as your party gets incredibly strong once you’ve got ability point generation and damage for auto attackers.   But the story is ok. The champions are great and you know what you’re getting.  You’ll get about 10 hours out of this if you grind, which is not necessary for normal difficulty. But it’s a good 10 hours with replay ability. It’s not FF tactics but there’s only one game in the App Store that is, that’s more expensive and most of us have already owned it twice.  Highly recommend and will keep looking for Demons Rise 3 or other titles. I know there’s a new one and I didn’t fancy the way it looked, but having playing this again I’m going to take another look"
"14504",1153028211,"I enjoy this game so very much! Great time consumer! As every other customer/reviewer, I have just a few requests. Only two though! One: would you mind making the maps just a bit bigger because with that many heroes and enemies on screen it can get kind of tight. Two: could you maybe add just a few more character to help finish off some of the heroes collections I already have, if y’all don’t mind that is. At least on giant female character would be cool like some elephant lady god or something cool idk, and one smaller deadly character like a red cap or an imp or deadly gnome or something. Other than that keep up the awesome work because I love it when devs update regularly so keep it up! Oh and thank you!  UPDATE: okay I finally thought of something, can y’all add a Banshee, a powerful poltergeist, evil butcher (with like a huge cleaver), musketeer black dwarf with a spawnable cannon. Thanks and keep up the good work!"
"14505",1153028211,"There is potential for something amazing in this game but I don’t know if the devs are ever going to pursue it. The mechanics are good but the maps are small. It would be great to see some open maps with options. Also wish they would’ve changed some things from the first game. They switched the characters and optimized some interface but it’s almost exactly the same. Not even sure why there is a “world map” when you can’t do anything four read about a place that you will never visit in game. I hope there is an update for it and we get to play more campaigns."
"14506",1153109870,"I wanted to give it a four or even five for the great idea sadly it is almost solely in what I assume to be chinese. Pity really I can not understand almost everything and to recommend it would be a mistake if I can read what a flower is all in all it’s not a bad app (I think) just lost through translation I guess add more languages will be the real growth here"
"14507",1153109870,"easy to use,very practicle when in spring every blossom seems so fresh and needs to beintroduced, just one suggestion: how come there's no sharing button on the result page? it would be much more convenient!"
"14508",1153109870,"0/10 Would Not Download Again"
"14509",1153136025,"I love this game! It's hard buy addicting! I highly recommend this! If your board or something it's perfect but make sure you have a lot of time on your hands because when you start you won't stop!"
"14510",1153136025,"The gameplay of this app is fairly decent, HOWEVER, every single time you fall off the side, you have to either watch a video, or pay actual money for coins in order to continue the game! After one or two times of doing that, and you'll be doing exactly what I did...DELETING!!!"
"14511",1153136025,"Pros:  This app has gorgeous graphics and music, plus simple controls (one touch and timing based). Can't stress graphics enough.  Cons:  Prize wheel only gives blue scarfs (despite the fact that supposedly all scarfs can be won). Also, when a new scarf is bought (for plenty of in-game coins), it's usable, but when switched to another scarf it's not available. Another thing: quality of screenshots from the ""share"" section is crap (and in the latest version, screenshots can only be shared to facebook or twitter).  Honestly, as soon as these problems are fixed the game will be pretty much perfect. Unfortunately, I can't give 5 stars because  of these cons."
"14512",1153449735,"I love this game so much. It’s relaxing and helps relieve my anxiety. It brings my mood up and is such a wonderful game. It would be cool if after you’re all maxed out you can make like a little farm and decorate it with items you earn in a mini game or something!"
"14513",1153449735,"I love this game soooo much. I rarely write reviews for games so if y’all got me this far, you should be impressed. I regret writing one review, but this one I’m proud of right now! I wish you could make it where you can make different games so you can keep playing one you’ve completed, and start a new one with different pigs with different personalities! I love this game though! Keep up the good work! Btw, this game is so stinking cute! 🐖 🐷 🐽 ❤️"
"14514",1153449735,"Never my life have I become so attached to a pig. This is a great game and it’s super cute they also don’t have any micro transactions so that’s a huge plus tho there are ads but there not too bad !! So please adopt this pig <3"
"14515",1153515245,"Y’all the best"
"14516",1153515245,"I love this game"
"14517",1153515245,"Cool game"
"14518",1153694100,"At first I was reluctant to buy the game but I was drawn to the graphics because of the similar super Mario world art direction. But What i really like about the game is the hunt for items which Require a little bit of strategy but all together its fun, not too long and enjoyable."
"14519",1153694100,"It was very puzzling at first, but once I got the hang of it, I real enjoyed the game. The only negative thing was that it didn’t need to be 2.99"
"14520",1153694100,"I enjoyed “Traps n’ Gemstones” but this one is too hard and unforgiving for me. It’s classic Mario-like platformer including the tedious go back to start when you die. It’s just too tedious to be fun. I wish there was an easy mode."
"14521",1153883316,"Great relaxing game"
"14522",1153883316,"A fun game to play!  Play and think at the same time!  Good for children and adults."
"14523",1153883316,"I used to have this app and it was great! Then, somebody deleted it. I reinstalled it and it is very addicting."
"14524",1153896723,"It’s so glitchy i go to 1000m then I glitched and now I deleted the game pls don’t download it it’s so bad pls say creator fix the glitches"
"14525",1153896723,"The main characters are just the ice climbers"
"14526",1153896723,"I thought the idea was clever and good. Until I went to the cat challenge and I’m currently stuck on level 7! Platforms In this level get way too small and it gets increasingly unfair. And if you screw up too many times? AD! Boring. Not a good way to kill time. I think the art design and the design of the characters are good. But the controls are AWFUL! Ultimately, I will not be touching this game for a while."
"14527",1154065290,"This is a fun game"
"14528",1154065290,"It is so cool"
"14529",1154065290,"The levels should not be 🔒 halfway through just to get people to pay for the rest of the levels.😆"
"14530",1154282030,"I really like Cosmo. He’s pretty cool. A few things I didn’t know before we bought him   He has to be connected to a smart device or he will not work at all. That means he does not go off and do things on his own like the commercials showed or at least alluded to.   He can’t hear you. No mics.  He has a hard time seeing without bright lights or the sun.   How come you can have an explore feature for him. He will only go near his blocks but won’t venture much further than that.   I know you have a second version coming out but I think you can add some features to Cosmo to try to emulate some of the new features that Vector will have.  Keeps disconnecting and now no support."

"14536",1154401422,"I love this app, but it totally quit working and continues to do so no matter how many times I delete and redownload, both on my iPhone and iPad. None of the in-app icons function when tapped. I would buy this app outright (NOT on a monthly fee obligation) but it won't let me do anything. Any help out there?"

We were taking a road trip to see her grandparents and she was so excited to get this new app to play on the way.

Too little too late on the iCloud integration; it would have been nice before the game breaking freemium update caused many of the original players to delete the game...  The launch version of this game was amazing."

"14559",1155982200,"Would 1 of the greatest ARPGs I’ve ever played if not for 1 gripe. After the tutorial, you’re given a time frame( which is around 3mins or so) on your first mission to complete the said objectives. Racing against the clock in an ARPG? Not sure about others, but I’m not a fan. If however, the clock was used for recording which specified and how many objectives could get completed in an allotted amount of time( as such in other ARPGs like Kritika), the game would improve significantly. Other then all that I see what others reviews say about gameplay, the gameplay is nothing to argue about. Thx ;)"

"14583",1156258040,"Overall the app is okay I do think it’s sluggish and not too fast and can be glitchy and buggy but I love the plot line definitely had me wanting to play more it could just use better graphics and I would continue playing this game if it was free or at least had the option to watch ads to get more episodes or something so i can keep playing without having to pay I would definitely use this app more"

BUT THEN IT GIVES ME A ADD ANYWAY WITH NO AWARD!!!🤬 And before I even started I got a add! The adds ruin it. And I deleted the game because of it, if not a lot of adds existed I would be fine. But they ruin it.... 🥺😡😡😡"
"14585",1156447726,"First of all I really recommend this game it is so fun to play and I don't even care if I have to buy stuff. I'm not going to buy stuff. But it doesn't matter. I love it!!

"14587",1156704617,"This game is definitely fun and a quick play. It’s a good pick up game that you can enjoy but it is limited. Obviously the developer wants you to buy the upgrades and spend money but it is a little bit ridiculous. I wouldn’t mind paying a few dollars for a full game with all the modes unlocked but the developer clearly doesn’t want to do this. They want to drain the consumer and that makes the consumer spend no money within the app. Seriously make an affordable 2-3 dollar option to unlock every mode and people will invest!"
"14588",1156704617,"It's free and it's fun"
"14589",1156704617,"It crashes sometimes but that really rare ..it doesn't lag or nothing it's hella fun ... u don't need to use the internet or wifi to play 😂 get the game it's fun. plus why not?"
"14590",1156856246,"This game is pretty cool. Its very hard once you get to the 10,000 meter line. Although the game is very fun, it can be kind of laggy. If you want to play it on the VR set, do these. • Get an iPhone • Get a Virtual Reality/ VR set • Download the App • Slide the slot from the VR set and put your phone in it. • Slide it back in and put on the set on your head • Play a very fun game You can turn/shift your head to turn the bike so that it will avoid the cars - Main Objective- : Try not to touch the cars and avoid them   The more meters you go, the more money you get This is a very fun game and I suggest you try it out!! :)"

"14594",1156875272,"A few issues with the app.  1. You need to be literate in Japanese to sign up for a new account.  2. It asks for a Japanese zip code but you can use any random valid zip in Japan  3. Changing password doesn’t result in re-authentication.  Face ID continues to work between password change.  Not sure what’s going on....  4. It appears to store your password in plain text.  It shows your password in plain text when you perform a password change.  To confirm...  5. Password reset requires you to essentially re-supply all the info you provided during sign up.   The UI is an ugly form back for 90s....  6. Password reset requires a manual verification by some person.  It’s not fully automated.    Overall, ok once it works but the app is a nightmare to setup and troubleshoot."

"14601",1157479274,"Great game, but the tanks prefer the term ""beefy"" to the term chunky, as chunky is a degrading term referring to anything from bad turkey to a bowel movement, which coincidentally may have been the bad turkey. I am not mad, just disappointed that you are not taking the inanimate objects' feelings into account as their god and creator. Great game regardless."
"14602",1157494807,"Lovely activity app. Gives sharing adults some quality time with kids and lots of vocubulary building opportunities. I would definately reccommend this to ESL teachers."

"14618",1158667565,"It’s not the best game in the world. I don’t like doing it. It’s not addicting at all. I could just do it in real life at home.😒😒😒😒😒"
"14619",1158667565,"Honestly I don’t like the game but I gave it two ⭐️ because it’s more fun if you flip the bottle in real life the game it’s just a one tap then ✅ done if the game would be upgraded I suggest that you let the game not only bottle but lots of games in 1game  and thanks 🙏"
"14620",1158735801,"The data is accurate but this would be great if it synched in the background automatically."
"14621",1158735801,"I wonder why a third party had to bridge the gap between FitBit and Apple. Problem solved with Fitness Sync!  Thanks guys!"
"14622",1158735801,"Despite changing settings my steps were not add d into Apple health correctly"
"14623",1159035153,"I Love this game it is so cool"
"14624",1159035153,"I love ❤️ this game it's the CUTEST GAME EVER! I was adout to puke! So I give this  game FIVE STARS! good job 👏🏻"
"14625",1159035153,"I love this game and yah but I don’t like how the huge pineapple takes like 7 to 8 hours to get another one but also idk this is just a fun game"
"14626",1159072426,"The game is very fun to play and relaxing at times but there are some minor bugs that take a while to fix and even now I still don’t know how I managed to get them to stop"
"14627",1159072426,"This is a good game I just have a couple problems with it. My fist problem with it is that it is a HUGE battery drainer. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve played this game, and then have my phone die because of the game. (I personally think it’s because of the background. If there was a low power mode for the game, I would have that thing on 24/7. This really does turn me off from playing the game. Another problem I have with the game is that you either have to be actively playing the game or close the app completely. The game takes no time to start and loud. I just find it inconvenient to close the app for the train to move. I personally like to keep them open so I can get to them later quickly. But this is not possible with this game. Another con about having to be active or closed is that if you do leave the app open but are not actively playing, the train does not move. This happens way to often and is very frustrating to me. If I were to be nitpicking, I could also say that the lights in factories and depots don’t match (as in the lights just flout and have no source) but this is not problem in any way gameplay wise. Other than these few (semi big) flaws, the game is great and as a random stranger to you, I do recommend you play this game."
"14628",1159072426,"Just get it"
"14629",1159218681,"Overall I like the app but it has some functionality problems. On iPhone SE running iOS 11.3, the app does not line up in the screen. The 30 second skip function goes the opposite direction or to random times in the podcast. I can’t listen to live shows. When I press play on a podcast, nothing happens. When I reopen the app the resume a podcast, it starts over. Etc. etc. Would be great to get an update to fix all of this."
"14630",1159218681,"Awesome works as it should but when I try to skip through with the button it just goes to random parts of the podcast"
"14631",1159218681,"Heard from a friend how awesome the podcast is, so I downloaded the app after paying for it. And it just will not load anything an after a few seconds it will shut off, an go back to my home screen."
"14632",1159273771,"This game keeps crashing. Why????"
"14633",1159273771,"My game is not working I have the car the first car all level and now I have to buy a truck I have the money but when I try to unlock it doesn’t so what’s the matter with this game"
"14634",1159273771,"This game is unplayable and is trash"
"14635",1159290179,"The game would be really fun to play , if you could actually move. I shouldn’t have to press and swipe so hard I nearly break the screen just to jump up to a high level or wall vault."
"14636",1159290179,"What’s the actual difference between vector 2 and vector 2 premium version"
"14637",1159290179,"The first game was great. I finished every level with 3 stars but when the second game came out i was hyped so i bought the premium version and its a waste of money the first one was so much better this game is just terrible."
"14638",1159410526,"I’m really disappointed that there are not snake and cupcake emojis."
"14639",1159410526,"I purchased this a while back on my iPhone 6 plus when I got the iPhone 8 plus it never restored to my new phone how can I get them back"
"14640",1159410526,"Can you make a emoji app for Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and LeBron James"
"14641",1159611436,"My kids love it I can get stuff done without them 🐜 bugging me it's just really helps"
"14642",1159611436,"I couldn't have expected this game to be so enjoyable, but it keeps getting more challenging and more interesting with each slight increase in difficulty and new trap. I keep coming back to it time and again, something very few iOS games manage to pull off."
"14643",1159611436,"Wow, so much fun and so very simple. At each new kill type you have to relearn the best way to use it. Game stops at level 100 though. Please add more levels."
"14644",1160056295,"Lol"
"14645",1160056295,"Should smooth while playing"
"14646",1160056295,"ဆော့မကောင်း"
"14647",1160380201,"This game is so cool. It’s very aesthetic and pleasing to the eye. I haven’t played it yet, but it looks super super fun and coool. This game is amusing!"
"14648",1160380201,"This game is so amazing. I love this game so much you don’t even know , I’m so addicted I’m on level #68,446 . ITS SUCH A GOOD GAME , and I do the shape thingy in atleast 5 seconds , I don’t know I feel like this game teaches me a lot lol :))"
"14649",1160380201,"The only downside I have to this app is that it doesn’t save your progress. I got this app and played 40 some levels and it crashed and when I went back into it I was at level one and could not go back to the level I was at. And now every time I close the app and go back into it my progress restarts without the option for me to go back to where I was"
"14650",1160495350,"This game is a lot of fun. The hints are better than in some games because they are more direct"
"14651",1160495350,"Not one of my favorites"
"14652",1160495350,"Awesome game!! Good hos, puzzles, character interactions, storyline, etc."
"14653",1160574357,"This is actually a great one! simpler system, but requires more techniques to play well. The simulated rules of a store are much more real. I played most of their games and love this one too."
"14654",1160574357,"You get 5 stars every game for the sole fact of being a company who hasn't abandoned a full game for money.  Pay to win has killed the gaming world, yet you stick to your roots.  Bravo Kairosoft"
"14655",1160574357,"I love this company’s ideas so much and I was looking forward to this game so badly, but they missed the mark completely. The tutorial poorly explains the game and there’s little to no control over what happens. Everything from sales to finding items is random and it doesn’t completely make sense to me I’m super sad because I love economy/shop based games. Huge disappointment 😔"
"14656",1160688144,"This game is awesome for babies but please give a better reason for an ambulance, and that girl who fell off of it I’m sure she wouldn’t have to go to the hospital, but otherwise this game is great and I really enjoyed it!"
"14657",1160688144,"Hi! My name is Alissa Arzikaya. I am Mackanize’s sister. Nice to great full meet you! I’m using my sisters phone to make a review to you. Me and Mackanize are twin sisters and we are both 16 years old and love to play these games! We played them since we were 2 years old. But this is Cheap money! Like only $2.99! But we do not want to waste all our $8000000 we got on our birthday for our bank account. We use it to raise money for our collage and to buy lol dolls. Me and my sister hope you can make everything free. Me and Mackanize’s birthday are on the same exact day and people can’t tell which twin is which cuz we wear the same outfits all the time. But Mackanize is the oldest because she was born first and I was born 1 hour ago. So I just want you adding all this to it! Thank you!

"14658",1160688144,"I love how you got all your stuff together"
"14659",1160690385,"So I bought the ad free in-app purchase but still get those pesky banners at the bottom. What’s more the banners COVER UP THE MENU at the bottom so I can’t play the game at all.  $2.99 wasted."
"14660",1160690385,"None Ads plz"
"14661",1160690385,"I love it it has wizards anime lol"
"14662",1160723843,"The game is great but you need to reduce the ads to play after every 4 th board not after every one thx"
"14663",1160723843,"Love the Game.  iPhone X support PLEASE"
"14664",1160723843,"Great game"
"14665",1160731868,"This is what mobile games should be."
"14666",1160731868,"The stained glass art is unique and stunning. Excellent story line."
"14667",1160731868,"Wow! First day the game is available, and I can't even play it! The screen is blank, and then kicks me out. My iPad meets all the requirements. I deleted it, and downloaded again -- to no avail. They charge $2.99 for a game that doesn't even work! Way to go Mangatar! Real score zero stars, but Apple makes you give one. Fix it!"
"14668",1160751111,"I like to listen to beat matched music all the time."
"14669",1160751111,"Simple, sweet, user, friendly."
"14670",1160751111,"Great app. But make it the same for all devices. For example when you set up cue points on the iPad then you go on the MacBook there in different slots.  Also you can’t name the cue points on the iPad."
"14671",1161122860,"Here is another great game from Game Stew. Keep up the great work Devs!"
"14672",1161122860,"Fun"
"14673",1161122860,"First of all i love Game Stew, and i really hope someone read this. The power ups arent really power up, the magnet just send your ball to a random location and when it sticks to you time still passes, also power ups bounce the ball back, i already lost a level because the ball bounced away from the enemy in a magnet thing. In some levels the enemy is one-two blocks away, making it almost impossible to properly control your guy. But its should be fun! It looks fun! Maybe an option to disable the magnet would make the game better? Please consider that. With love, a fan"
"14674",1161175470,"Two screens and two objects all the buttons disappear and don’t come back. On top of language issue."
"14675",1161175470,"In many of these games, knowing Japanese might make it easier, but the puzzles do not require it or you can use shape recognition to figure them out. In this game, the last puzzle is impossible if you can’t read the Japanese text (or, as another reviewer stated, know the convention this game designer uses)."
"14676",1161175470,"Need to have English instructions."
"14677",1161194581,"I don’t like it because it goes to fast for you to move the block"
"14678",1161194581,"b r u h Tell me why?"
"14679",1161194581,"It is the way that I want it to go it won’t let me go the way that it wasn’t that I wanted to gopooop"
"14680",1161231636,"Fairly simple. I enjoy most of these games. What I didn’t get was the note with 4 circles. Don’t think I ever used it and was able to escape without it. Overall though Sato’s games keep me entertained."
"14681",1161231636,"I know some people have complained that the puzzles in “Signs” are too simplistic, and even redundant. I’m of the opinion that Sato’s puzzles are nicely integrated into the theme of each escape game, flow logically from step to step, and provide varying degrees of difficulty.  But beyond that, I play Sato’s Games - both the easier and more difficult - because of their beautiful, crisp graphics and zen-like groove.  “Illumination” was my only let down in that regard, and otherwise - just joy."
"14682",1161231636,"Delightful!"
"14683",1161267000,"That's it, that's all there is? More levels please! Great Game!"
"14684",1161267000,"It's a really really great game that a challenge of your brain, I love this game so much!"
"14685",1161267000,"The only complaint I have is that it drained my battery and made my phone uncomfortably warm.  So no long sessions playing this game.  Otherwise, it was a great puzzle game.  One of my favorites!   More levels, please!"
"14686",1161323425,"This game forces you to watch advertisements just to learn new concepts and you have to finish the level the EXACT way they want you to, otherwise it will not let you proceed."
"14687",1161323425,"If the tutorial was better at explaining the movement of the blocks this would have been more entertaining. There's a difference between a worthwhile puzzle game and cumbersome game."
"14688",1161323425,"Apparently they decided that what the world needed was a less fun version of something we already have.  ""crappy-ripoff-Tetris"" or whatever they called it. I don't remember the name cause I already deleted it."
"14689",1161444237,"This is a great add on to the elf experience. The game is fun for kids and adults and comes with additional activities making it well worth the 99cent price tag!"
"14690",1161444237,"Our family loves playing this game and appreciate the family values it teaches. Definite recommendation for the Christmas season."
"14691",1161444237,"I'm really disappointed that I have to pay for the app after I payed good money for the book & dog. My kids had to have this app once they saw it on the box.  I was going to buy reindeer for other my other child- but now they can Share the dog. Since I would than have to pay for the reindeer app too!  Disappointed Momma here."
"14692",1161496947,"BAD"
"14693",1161496947,"Ummmmmmmmm, relook at the title!!!! LOL"
"14694",1161496947,"Awful game"
"14695",1161538212,"Love this!  Sherm for President!"
"14696",1161538212,"Who doesn't want to text with Sherman's emoji?! This latest release is so cool with holiday and holiday emojis.   The designs are cool and the user interfaces are awesome. Lastly, the keyboard works very very well."
"14697",1161538212,"Downloaded the app, but unsure about allowing full access when it says it could see everything I have ever typed (including cr dit card number). Eek!!"
"14698",1161626399,"Right after I run from a wild Micromon it crashes"
"14699",1161626399,"as soon as i start the app it just closes the app it doesn’t let me start the game❗️im playing on a iphone 8 i dont know if it has anything to do with that"
"14700",1161626399,"So I love this game and the developers and I recently decided I wanted to try out the arena to get some diamonds to get a pet without paying money. Only I try and log on to the area and it never loads no matter if I’m on WiFi or not it will not load to let me play in the arena. I really want to give this game a better rating but with the arena being hyped up so much and not being able to play it I can’t. Hopefully the developers fix this issue."
"14701",1161656633,"I can’t get past lvl I keep ding so I deleted the game"
"14702",1161656633,"Looking for combine promotion games/apps, we can provide ASO service, daily installs can reach 3000+. Ping me at Skype:18226562962 . Every one can get a test promtoin fot 3 days now!"
"14703",1161656633,"It’s really fun"
"14704",1161717622,"its a good game overall but i think that you should be able to pick:freehand writing or dotted lines.but it really is a good game."
"14705",1161717622,"I like Big Numbers but it needs an update. I have some ideas for an update. Maybe you could be able to send your friends materials. or use materials to speed up when you get a new tree .or when you’re making something. And maybe they could be a few more Islands."
"14706",1161717622,"Please put the game back to normal because it will ask you to  get 57295 coins for the orb I don’t even know if it’s the right  Number SO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!"
"14707",1161739347,"Love it ! Fun to play."
"14708",1161739347,"I'm new at this game. I'll have to see."
"14709",1161739347,"Great fun"
"14710",1161746000,"Does not do anything it says, cannot make the extra helps work, bad game all around! Needs to be fixed or removed altogether!"
"14711",1161746000,"I really had fun with this game at first. Now I have been stuck on Level 75 for days! Very frustrating."
"14712",1161746000,"Didn't like the controls to shoot the bug....would rather it be like other ""bubble"" shooting games. Beat one level and uninstalled. I'll try another one."
"14713",1161836152,"Fantastic game. Love it!!"
"14714",1161836152,"This game is fun and challenging!! 5 stars!"
"14715",1161836152,"WOWWIE WOWWIE"
"14716",1162087330,"I CANT EVEN GET FREAKING 3!!! I got so mad that I threw my phone across the room and completely cracked the screen. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT A CRACKED PHONE SCREEN!!!!!"
"14717",1162087330,"I'm addicted and can't stop playing but I'm absolutely outraged at THIS GAME!!!! I like it you should get it."
"14718",1162087330,"Too many ads for this app, banner ads pop up ads everything."
"14719",1162255664,"They made like a total of 5 updates and ditched the game, it’s sad it was a great game."
"14720",1162255664,"I ❤️ this game, BUT DA BLOOD DOE! Make the blood a little bit less graphic. I’m deleting if you don’t turn down the blood. (Just kidding)"
"14721",1162255664,"This game hasn’t been updated in 2 years, what’s up with that. I love this game and play it almost everyday but I need new content"
"14722",1162783385,"The detail in the writing of this choice game is absolutely enthralling. I replayed this story multiple times and depending on how i stated my genius and my instrument I had melodies running around in my Own head! Try it and you will be wrapped in this story. Totally unique and unlike any other choice story I've read ever! Nicely done. 😁"
"14723",1162783385,"The choices don't seem to matter save perhaps at the end. The romance with the Countess was unsatisfying, and most of the characters were forgettable, indeed when they popped up later they were I unremembered.  Effort went into the story, the premise had promise, but it was kind of mediocre in execution. The writer has potential, keep writing, just involve the reader more in what is going on."
"14724",1162783385,"Absolutely adored the story and characters. The game is also great for its replayability."
"14725",1162794046,"The game does not actually give you any real choices and you do not feel the eight of any choices you make. Ultimately you are forced to work alongside the revolution no matter what. The options for romance is so benign that there really isn’t any. No matter what choice you make the story goes on regardless and you with it.   It gives lots of names with no effort to actual have dialog with them. So your left with a strange informality with dozens of characters with as much character depth as a kiddy pool. Ultimately really disappointed and not worth the 6 bucks."
"14726",1162794046,"It's tragic that a game with such a good story and unique setting is ruined by awful stat designed.   Seriously, for most of the choices in the game you have to guess which stat correlates with it, and the stats themselves are just confusing sometimes. Some choices I can't even tell which one is reaction or vigor, or which one correlates with finesse and not vigor. It honestly ruins the game when I make every single decision incorrectly because I don't even understand what stats are being used.  Besides this, this game is great."
"14727",1162794046,"I really like the story and found it easy to get attached to the characters, very well written. Some of the mechanics didn't really make sense and sometimes it was hard to properly envision the setting, but all-in-all it was a great game."
"14728",1162838832,"Could not stop playing this game. So in depth and addicting, I highly recommend it"
"14729",1162838832,"I appreciate the intricacies and length of the game. The fact that one has to really think about their choices isn't found in a lot of COG apps. Not sure if I like the mechanic where the stats of the advisors affect which suggestion they'll give you; kinda messes with the way I view their character. Also a bit disappointed in the romantic gameplay; I wish there was more to it."
"14730",1162838832,"Worth the money! It's a bit pricey, but this is my favorite Choice Of game. There are so many storylines to explore, and the ending will definitely get you wanting to play again!"
"14731",1163313156,"I loved this game and all the others by this author and would absolutely love a third one. I definitely recommend this and the first one if you like sci-fi games"
"14732",1163313156,"First off, the biggest pro that I see in this game is how the story evolves. The first book focuses more on consistency, with developing the main goals of your character and making consistent choices paramount to succeed. However, the second book, while still making sure you keep consistency, offers you some more flexibility given the politicking scheming side of it. Overall, despite it being a little confusing at times, I find it best to take it at face value. If I don’t understand what is being explained, I either read it over or simply look at the choices and see which stat the choices utilizes best. This way, I can take it at “face value” and just determine which choice coincides with my stat if the explaining gets too confusing. That said, I’d recommend it to anyone. Very well done."
"14733",1163313156,"A fantastic follow up from the Versus story. I cannot wait for the next addition!"
"14734",1163404732,"Do not download this app! It’s a SCAM to track your info. YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!!! You want to use legit Jordan emoji’s and messaging? Download the footlocker app it has a Jordan emoji feature . You’re welcome."
"14735",1163404732,"Needs full access to phone that tracks and saves all you do🤔"
"14736",1163404732,"I use my phone to shop online so therefore ive used my cards multipul times on here.  I do not feel the need to share that information with any developer for any reason. So as much as i would love to use this jordan app, issa no from me."
"14737",1163470174,"The game was fun in general  .. had a great 3 hours trying to finish it :P  Would love to see more but would be better if they're a little bit longer"
"14738",1163470174,"Totally challenging but delightfully fun!!!"
"14739",1163470174,"Very nice game, beautiful graphics. Clever puzzles, though some were hard to figure out. A nice game for passing the time."
"14740",1163621234,"This is so confusing help me pls"
"14741",1163621234,"Awesome game 10 out of 10 great for time consuming ps Love to skins their so awesome Pls add more item and more skins I have collected all others items and skin plz make more"
"14742",1163621234,"The 360 flips and 720 flips should count for extra. You don't even have to ""flip"" anything for points. You get a flip each time you contact pan"
"14743",1163684161,"Each level is challenging. The flip mechanic is very well done and atmosphere is top notch."
"14744",1163684161,NA
"14745",1163684161,NA
"14746",1163777816,"Simple fun game to try to beat my pace each time."
"14747",1163777816,"I love playing"
"14748",1163777816,"Nice and interesting game"
"14749",1163925890,"This is like the most funniest game app ever fun for the whole family and friends"
"14750",1163925890,"Mad that only a few are free! but fun to play with groups"
"14751",1163925890,"Very fun to play"
"14752",1163993025,"Another good one from this Dev.  Clever, two endings, has a save.  No language issues even though clues are in Japanese on the English version..!!  Minus a star for that, and for full screen pop-up video ads.  The banner ad is sufficient, thanks!"

"14754",1163993025,NA
"14755",1164013670,"I really like this game. It’s addictive!"
"14756",1164013670,"Since I installed this game I haven't played any of my other games. Thank you for this game."
"14757",1164013670,"The game is a lot of fun but it has some glitches. Twice the game froze and one time I had to delete the game re-download and start from the beginning. Other than that it is a fun game."
"14758",1164046790,"Favorite game I own I wish there was more epics. Epic battle simulator 2 is horrible though every thing looks weird and its so so hard to play on the only thing it did right was adding more epics"
"14759",1164046790,"I get that running ads is how you make money but it takes away from from game when instead of seeing the victory screen after working hard to beat a level you get an ad. And it’s the same ad you seen over and over again. Game deleted."
"14760",1164046790,"Add tanks.Add laser gunners.Add people riding dragons.Add Ocean monsters to the epic’s."
"14761",1164147984,"Intriguing game with heartbreakingly poetic story."
"14762",1164147984,"I had absolutely no problem with freezing. My complaint....hence only 4 stars.....is that this fantastic game is WAY too short.  I don't have a lot of time for game-playing so I was extremely surprised when the storyline ended abruptly after playing about 4 hours total.  Seems like the creators were in a hurry to get it running without realizing how quickly it would be completed by even an average player like me.  I do hope the makers will consider making another great one like this but will make sure it takes a while to finish it."
"14763",1164147984,"This game looks like a lot of fun, and I'm sure it would be, but unfortunately it's designed to freeze part of the way through the first story.  I've restarted it, deleted and reinstalled it, but it's just too buggy and poorly made to function.  I think they should consider making this app free, so people aren't ripped off when it doesn't work."
"14764",1164376202,"This app is good not the best and even when u pay for the upgrade they still ask u to rate it all the time. Fix this problem."
"14765",1164376202,"Cute emojis but not worth the fee."
"14766",1164376202,"Payed for upgrade adds went away but no new emojis then offer another 17 and cant get to them love some of emoji my lover and I have fun would like what upgrade said no adds and lots more emojis buck up"
"14767",1164423068,"It’s stylish and smart. I was excited about it being optimized for iPhone X, but disappointed when I saw that the notch covered parts of the photo frame. I know we’re supposed to “embrace the notch” and this is just personal preference, but I’d prefer data like images and photos to not be partially invisible with the notch. Otherwise, I believe this is a well executed app."
"14768",1164423068,"Needs a setting to TURN OFF automatic saving to Camera Roll and just make it a standalone app with pictures saved to itself."
"14769",1164423068,"Filters are great... If you can figure out how to export them! The user interface is a mess and its hard to find your way around this app. I bought all three from this developer in one go based on a recommendation from a website and frankly I wish I hadn't. Really bad user experience and its unclear how to get around the app. I've literally tapped and swiped my way around this thing to no avail. Messy and really needs to be better thought out. If you want to take photos quickly with nice filters and be on with your day, this is NOT the app to do it."
"14770",1164424437,"Clean sound effects and awesome game response to tapping things!  Love it 😍"
"14771",1164424437,"Every time a ad pops up it kicks me out of the game"
"14772",1164424437,"啦啦啦"
"14773",1164439637,"WHAT THE POOPER SCOOPER THIS IS AWESOME"
"14774",1164439637,"Terrible game it is just terrible I highly do not suggest it is a waste of your time !"
"14775",1164439637,"Its a very good game even tho its pay to play"
"14776",1164468822,"Anything have a heartbeat I put my phone on my hand it picked up a heartbeat also my floor have a heartbeat 🤣🤣🤣 not worth the time removing app asap"
"14777",1164468822,"I’ve tried this app twice, falling through with all the directions carefully and I still had no luck hearing my baby..."
"14778",1164468822,"This app is such a scam 😂😂 it literally played a heartbeat before I even touched it to my stomach."
"14779",1164484325,"I just bought it for freaking $2 and all it gives you is pictures that you can look up online DONT GET THIS APP"
"14780",1164484325,"Dont trust instagram or what instagram said this app is a waste of money and is just a money grabber it only makes you a background"
"14781",1164484325,"A piece of crap"
"14782",1164492728,"If you’re looking for something that’s easy to get into, with building complexity that keeps you engaged, this game will work. You get to use your spatial thinking and needing to turn the cube makes each puzzle more complex than you might think. I just finished the game and I enjoyed the time, I spent puzzling it out."
"14783",1164492728,"Fun game in the spirit of Rubik’s Cube"
"14784",1164492728,"This game is super fun so easy to pick it up but so hard to put it down i recommend this game to people who love a brain teaser and start to do something of good food fun this is why i rated this game 5/5 and it truly deserves this also taking the aesthetics into consideration, the graphics are just amazing and i truly love to play this game."
"14785",1164512642,"I love the squirrel! He is funny and cute! One time I made him fly over the road and I was laughing so much when I did that!"
"14786",1164512642,"You get to do the ice Ford and have a Lot of fun and decorate for the holidays!"
"14787",1164512642,"Love these apps! Keep up the good work."
"14788",1164801111,"Fantastic App. I have heart problems that pulse keeps on going up and down. Either very low pulse or a extremely high pulse w/A-fib. Gives a accurate description of what my heart was doing. Just it could tell me why. Let’s me know if I’m sleeping right. Too little or hoping that it’s enough. It’ll even tell you if you’re achieving a good deep sleep and if it was long enough. I highly recommend this App. Also if you don’t think it’s right, you can adjust to your sleep style"
"14789",1164801111,"I keep getting “system error” and inaccurate results and “no data from watch” when I’ve been wearing it all night, keep it charged and follow the instructions. Buggy as heck. I tried to use lights off feature and it ended up just not recording the entire night at all.   Another review compared this app to the Fitbit sleep tracking and I agree. It’s pretty silly that the Apple Watch can’t be just as capable, considering how much they cost compare to Fitbit."
"14790",1164801111,"Really useful app. Just need to remember to keep my Apple Watch charged and to wear it at night. This app isn’t perfect, and I use it along side of Pillow, set to manually track my sleep, but I often forget to push the button with it being late and me being sleepy- enter AutoSleep! This app has really helped to fill in the gaps in my sleep tracking. The visuals are powerfully informative, and there are more features than I even know of. The documentation and the help is informative and does not leave me frustrated and scratching my head. If you feel overwhelmed with a feature, worry not, the most important features are intuitive, but the advanced features get pretty technical and intense.  I highly recommend this app, and many of my friends that I’ve sung the praises to already were using it on a daily (nightly?) basis."
"14791",1165109912,"Thank you developers for providing a stress free game. The story was entertaining. The progress/grind was balanced well. And the app performed as well as my money spent upon purchasing the title. In other words thank you for keeping your word unlike other developers who expect payment but produce junk that doesn’t work. I look forward to purchasing other material from your studio."

"14794",1165315677,"I really want to get everything! So I don’t have to waste my time playing games to win some prizes."
"14795",1165315677,"IM SO MAD why do they  not let me go to level 11-20"
"14796",1165315677,"When I’m done with the first level there’s an add and takes me back to the start!I tried lots of times but it still does it please fix it’s annoying oops forgot to say read this please"
"14797",1165391697,"I love the game so much and I feel like it could only get batter please add more clowns from movies!😂"
"14798",1165391697,"I got all of the clowns and now its kinda getting more bad and im not enjoying this at all still i rate it aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa you'll see now"
"14799",1165391697,"I love this game!! The only flaw is it needs more Clowns!"
"14800",1165482016,"I have such a feeling of release when I use this app. It's so important to talk to God and the Angels and this app facilitates this for me."
"14801",1165482016,"I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase to buy ""Let Go Let God!"" I think this app is wonderful!! For instance, I can talk into my phone about whoever, whenever, and never have a worry of doubt that it may get back to that someone or ever thinking about somebody else's feelings, or spoil a secret about so n so!! I like this app because at any given moment of the day, I can stop, pull out my phone and REALLY talk to God. I know, I talk to God throughout the day, everyday! This app has helped me to heal, let go, forgive but, most of all....grow! It's another tool for my tool box!  I live you Doreen V. Shannon C. Waterford, MI"
"14802",1165482016,"Idk what I thought I was going to get with this app but just having a recorder to talk into is NOT what I wanted...maybe some type of prayer or affirmation or quote after would be nice...I deleted the app since; waste of money in my opinion..."
"14803",1165525994,"It makes my old photos so much clearer"
"14804",1165525994,"Takes small old pictures and makes them come alive! Used shots from my dad’s WWII pictures and cleaned them up and shared them with family!"
"14805",1165525994,"I had hundreds of old photos to scan in multiple albums. This app made it so easy, I didn’t even  have to take the photos out of the albums. The process was incredibly quick. Now I have hundreds of photos safely stored and easily shared with my family."
"14806",1165924249,"Cool app!"
"14807",1165924249,"Good"
"14808",1165924249,"Its the best 100%"

"14810",1166225107,"There’s this glitch that you have to move the makeup brush below the eyeshadow pallet to try to put on the darker shades of eyeshadow. It’s not the worst, but it is annoying and strange."
"14811",1166225107,"I love my town and my Aggervating cousin always want to use it but I be snatching the phone from her"
"14812",1166398861,"Cute game"
"14813",1166398861,"All four are similar enjoyable texting based dating sims. It’s a shame it’s strictly heterosexual relationships, but if that’s your thing, this “cheating simulator” is a fun little take on dating games. If the others were to be released in actual English, I would play those as well."
"14814",1166398861,"This game is the next best thing everyone needs to download"
"14815",1166596707,"So I got this game bc I thought it would be fun which it is but there are glitches with the game and it’s not my phone it’s the game but I feel they should add something new bc me and others pp get bored of doing the same things but the game is fun when u r kinda bored so I rate this game a 4-5 thank u for ur time"
"14816",1166596707,"It’s fun to play in the car when I don’t have anything to do"
"14817",1166596707,"I love this game but it’s always the same thing over and over so people it needs some new stuff. And I don’t have the full version so there is not that much stuff"
"14818",1166863768,"Fun game but lags horribly on the later tournaments making it almost unplayable and definitely unwinnable."
"14819",1166863768,"The control is terrible, there’s nothing between “all-out kick it as hard as you can” and “give it a tiny tap”.  And the ability to grow your stats is very limited, so you can’t even invest time getting better before the campaign ends and you have to start over."
"14820",1166863768,"Too repetitive and no clear instructions or guide as what things do, despite claiming otherwise on all accounts"
"14821",1166974799,"I Believed in Santa and the Easter bunny and tooth fairy until now what are you gonna do when a kid like me goes through the App Store and sees this I burst into tears when I saw this you just crushed my childhood dreams"
"14822",1166974799,"I’ve never left a review before but this app is brilliant! Made awesome pictures!"
"14823",1166974799,"Even after downloading the most recent version, this would not load on Easter. This is extremely disappointing as my kids have grown accustomed to “catching” the Easter Bunny in action."
"14824",1168399577,"Don't purchase this app it's not free and you have to put your phone number!!!!"
"14825",1168399577,"Love the design also the content of the app. It makes it much easier to follow the program, knowing how to execute every move to make the most of our fitness session and also not hurt ourselves. Thank you so much Sonia for all the work and love you put so that we can enjoy today your app 😘"
"14826",1168399577,"I have trained with Sonia's program for the past year with great results, I am super happy with this new application!"
"14827",1168567265,"Without having to hop on an extra controller, this is probably the most finished VR game out there. I finished the game quite quickly though, hope the devs continue to expand the story further and break the suspense."
"14828",1168567265,"This one of the most fun games I’ve played on my Google Cardboard. For a horror game, it is surprisingly easy on the eyes. But I do miss more scares than in other games out there, and with having to constantly move and turn around, some aggressive zombies would make things interesting."
"14829",1168567265,"The gameplay is really good for a VR game, and I liked going till the end, finally managing to end that last wave of zombie ambush. Still, the game could be much better in terms of more gameplay. The current ending leaves much to the imagination and a few mission sets outside the hospital ought to do it."
"14830",1168645184,"My daughter loves this app... it’s the first thing on her mind when she wakes up. She loves dogs but we can’t have one at home and this does the trick, at least until we manage to make some space for a real one. We paid a $3 dollar one time fee and honestly is nothing when you see your kid so entertained with a smile on her face at all times."
"14831",1168645184,"I didn’t purchase this app.  Will delete the app."
"14832",1168645184,"Cute and my daughter loves all sago mini apps and paid for a few, but i did noticed they dont talk. Would be better if the characters talk. Will help kids with communication"
"14833",1169530248,"Too many ads. Goodbye"
"14834",1169530248,"One -- it's the fewest stars i can give in a review. This could be a mildly fun game,  but instead it's commercial trash.  Hadnt fully discovered the rules of game play by my second when it downloaded and launched a full screen 30 second video ad.  No warning, no cancel button. I'm taken aback.  What kind of scum comes up with this sort of ploy? This challenge the entire Apple Store and the dependent products.  Leave this one in the play store trashcan...."
"14835",1169530248,"SO many :30 ads right out of the gate - and after EVERY mini game - made it impossible to immerse, let alone get a feel for gameplay. This FTP model only works for some things, and rarely at that. Just charge a small price from the beginning. I would've likely given this very nice idea at least a chance."
"14836",1169545955,"Add boys"
"14837",1169545955,"I’ve had this game since 8th grade till now and I love it but you guys need to update it more often there’s a lot of bugs, one of them is the game taking me to my home screen or the game just crashing. You should add maps and more characters if you can ☺️"
"14838",1169545955,"I like the game, very challenging but theres to many adds"
"14839",1169836224,"Thank you for releasing a high quality keyboard. So much better than kimoji"

"14841",1169836224,"These emojis are so much fun and perfectly represent J Balvin ⚡️"
"14842",1169971902,"This is not a very entertaining app, its a shame because it's a great character and TV show. The activities are essentially the same for each of the animals so my son got bored pretty quickly. Be nice to see some more original play ideas. Keep working at it."

"14845",1170155524,"Whenever you finally collect all the balls, it glitches and you lose every single one! Also in reverse mode, certain automatic tracks that you go on will un controllably kill you every time. Many design flaws."
"14846",1170155524,"I am kind of disappointed because I love ketchapp's games, but I found this very repetitive and boring. You can play over and over, but you won't get anything out of it."
"14847",1170155524,"It is a very good game except when it resets itself so I lose everything I did"

"14853",1170395210,"The first puzzle was difficult so I’m thankful for the hints. It’s a great game and super clever. I have played nearly all of them and this one has become a favorite. Please make more!"
"14854",1170455562,"It is so bad."
"14855",1170455562,"Miniworld i'm sorry to say this you are the copy of minecraft!Could you Chinese think another idea game please?!Like you can make car in Miniworld.So why don't you make a car making simulater!Just saying that but minecraft always better than your game you freaking Chinese"

"14857",1171015241,"Cute story, and melancholy especially if you area dad who has a daughter of your own.  However, the game itself is pretty simplistic, so 3 stars.  Was only playing to read the story."
"14858",1171015241,"Love the story. I so badly want to know how it’s going to end so it keeps me playing. One thing I do notice is there seems to be a dead spot on the controls, at least on my iPhone 7+. It’s on the far left side of the controls."

"14872",1171558918,"Come on, you guys.  The game play is fun, but completion of all missions is IMPOSSIBLE!!!! I hope that you fix this, but I have moved on to other great games.  I must now rate this game as a DO NOT BUY unless/until this is FIXED!"
"14873",1171558918,"super addicting high score if 79 love it so much"
"14874",1171558918,"Awesome game, but, when an ad pop up it wont pause the game... fix this!!!"
"14875",1171814682,"There are too many ads and whenever I say I don’t want to watch an ad for extra life, it gives me an ad anyway and it’s really frustrating. I think that you should have a skin customize station in the game so you can mix some of the skins and create new ones! I also don’t like when you are trying to do a challenge and an ad pops up on the side of the screen, when you are turning and you accidentally click on the ad, it pauses the game and then when you click out of it you die. I think it’s a good game but too many ads that’s why only 3 stars:("

"14877",1171814682,"hey do like the game but i hate it at the same level hahahahaha"
"14878",1172179917,"Found phone games have to feel remotely close to reality for the effect to work for me. But putting parents into contacts by their full names instead of “Mom” and “Dad”... Every phone number in the game is four digits instead of seven or ten. It’s just the beginning of a series of immersion breaking choices. I can suspend disbelief for a bit, but eventually the lack of real world anything just doesn’t work for me."
"14879",1172179917,"This game deserves more attention It's very good I found it by accident because of the sale If you're hesitating just buy it already"
"14880",1172179917,"This game is amazing. I found myself googling Morse code and checking to see if To-Do, Retsnom, Rabbit Hole 3D and Rain Song by Zero-project were real.

"14900",1173990889,"I think it’s a fun game in all but like there is to many ads so idk I like playing them still anyways you could get it if you can deal with the ad overload"
"14901",1173990889,"Don't get it, thank me later."
"14902",1174041307,"I love the story and everything, but I can not buy ticket, I try but it’s imposible"
"14903",1174041307,"I have been reading Linda Brown for several years and I do enjoy the story line. I would recommend this story for people to enjoy as I do."
"14904",1174041307,"I love this game but come on have a way to get free tickets as well ! All the time is readers have to spend money on tickets ! Why can we get free tickets as well and waiting almost 2 hours for a ticket is ridiculous!"
"14905",1174468136,"I played this more then I could count"
"14906",1174468136,"Very cringeworthy. Reads like something a 13 year old would make on Deviantart. Weeabooish and not interesting enough to make up for it, plus choices are usually cosmetic at best. Pass."
"14907",1174468136,"I loved it despite the few grammar errors it had the diversity of characters and different routes you can take and spells you can learn. PLEASE CONTINUE!!!! I need more!!!!"
"14908",1174503010,"This game is great for playing when you are standing in line or just waiting for something! The only thing I wish this game had is a ranking system / leaderboard"
"14909",1174503010,"It's a very fun game but it's really hard at the start good game over all"
"14910",1174503010,"The game was okay but now the controls are broken and I can't even make a slight adjustment or slide at all please fix this."
"14911",1174545438,"I bought it thinking it was the cool app that my friend had...but it so is not the case. The graphics are sooo poor. Just an epic fail all around. The fact that I paid the $1.99 is shameful."
"14912",1174545438,"Pt. T. Barnum, ""There is a sucker born every minute."" He must have been looking at me when I ordered this app. Awful."
"14913",1174545438,"Terrible"
"14914",1174727122,"This is among the most excellent escape games I’ve ever played. Great puzzles, responsive controls, can’t ask for much more. Thanks!"
"14915",1174727122,"Very good Escape the Room Game.  WoodenToy is still my favorite from Koji Morimoto but this is a good game. Crisp clean graphics, good progression, satisfying and logical puzzles."
"14916",1174727122,"Very nice. Boxes hard but well thought out. Thank you"
"14917",1175953961,"The game has a fun and great user interface but the wildly inaccurate scoring, especially as you progress through advanced levels, is incredibly frustrating as you won’t be able to continue through to new levels. Seriously need to fix this."
"14918",1175953961,"The creator NEEDS to change the game and there needs to be more money because I cannot get kookie cookie which is 12,00 Coin and I even got cheeky chocolate and she attracts coin and I one couldn’t do anything l pressed it like 100 times and it would not do anything"
"14919",1175953961,"I’ve noted the same as previous reviewer‘s. Many times things that you jump or collect are not added to your total while other times it is. It seems random and hard to reproduce. Most recently it was jumping over party tables and collecting confetti piles. For example, the goal will be 15 of one of those items and I kept manual account only to find I have very few or even zero at the end of the run when I was supposed to have cleared the task. Very frustrating for a paid game. If they fix the bugs, I’d recommend it. If not, look elsewhere."
"14920",1176147574,"Does not want to load up the app.."

"14925",1176148737,"Great Advent Calendar: but this one is last year Calendar! I discovered edition 2017 which is now also available on iTunes"
"14926",1176156412,"If you like challenges, then you'll like this game. I'm pretty awful at it, but I like a challenge. Lots of room for me to improve!"
"14927",1176156412,"It got boring after 5 minutes. A good game to pass time though."
"14928",1176156412,"No"
"14929",1176374647,"App never displays anything on the AppleWatch but the icon.  Tried turning on and off, reinstalling, customizing the data on iphone vs. watch.  Huge waste of time."
"14930",1176374647,"Can’t do anything. Very frustrating."
"14931",1176374647,"The app works OK for what it is. But the iPhone companion app is flat out horrid to use. I can only use 1 complication on the infographic external to the circle area. When trying to use the inner circle complications, the app rounds up or down to a whole number. I jogged 2.6 miles today. Not 3.   I tried to contact customer support and got zero replies.   I only hope the developer(s) fix this. Till then, I won’t be using this app."
"14932",1176486119,"I originally watched a YouTube series about Ronald McDonald murdering people so how could I resist playing it and yelling like Ronald McDonald 10/10 would play again"
"14933",1176486119,"A new weapon they should add in the game should be called the nugget mines. Like the milkshakes but their chicken nuggets as mines."
"14934",1176486119,"This game is pretty cool because the concept is very unique and awesome, and it’s more addictive than anything. I usually play when I’m offline or just bored, but this game a really good go to when you just wanna have some fun. I think it would be nice to add a PvP arena so you can play against other Mimes and all"
"14935",1176492470,"I have paid for several games from this company and they work well for a few weeks but now every single one of them doesn’t register that I’ve paid for them and is only working as the free version. I’ve tried downloading them again and I’m using the same Apple ID that I bought them with. It’s really frustrating."
"14936",1176492470,"I just started playing, and I got tons of ads in just the first 10 minutes I played. I also don’t know why they didn’t start at the beginning of how they met, and instead started at the wedding. And my last question was why I couldn’t choose who she married. ☹️ I guess it’s a good game if there wasn’t so many ads and everything was unlocked without buying or watching videos to get more options."
"14937",1176492470,"Why why why are there so many adds?!? Every time you go out of something, there’s the same adds over and over again. I can’t buy the adds free thing, so please narrow it down! And respond...please."
"14938",1176875793,"Yyttyyyf"
"14939",1176875793,"Will be deleting as soon as I hit the pay for play wall."

"14941",1176877177,"Ok game till the ads take over!"
"14942",1176877177,"I'm having fun with the game"
"14943",1176877177,"Good game!"
"14944",1177414604,"Merry Happy Christmas indeed!  The arcade minigames on this one had me a bit kerflummoxed, but otherwise a nice little time-passer, with the wit and charm of all Jammsworks escapes. A holiday treat."
"14945",1177414604,"Although you can tell the English translation isn’t the best, the game is very fun. It’s not too complicated but makes you think and pay attention. The bonus gingerbread man game at the end put a smile on my face."
"14946",1177414604,"Fun, festive game that is great to relax and play. Some of the riddles did have me stumped for a bit! I really enjoyed it."
"14947",1177806007,"I purchased this app mainly for the health alerts. Myself and my daughters seem to be very sensitive to space weather, especially being pounded by cosmic radiation yesterday, and no alert was given. Lately I haven’t been getting any health alerts at all, so I hope that will change in the future. All I am getting lately is blot echo and earthquake alerts."
"14948",1177806007,"The old app was great! The New App also includes the combined Spaceweathernews.com feed which we use to monitor for extreme electrical plasma events in our local terrestrial, solar Neibor hood and beyond. We use the app to predict plasma events that affect our patients and our equipment for better patient care. Solar and terrestrial plasma events affect biology and equipment. This app keeps us on top of these events as close to live as it gets. Thank you Ben and crew Al Nunez DVM, CVA, CSO"
"14949",1177806007,"but when I try I get a message that says I’m already subscribed, so I can’t 🤦‍♀️ have loved this app...would love to love it more with all the added stuff available with pro. Rating low due to my frustration here. Would love to change that rating if I can get a solution."
"14950",1178082935,"Good"
"14951",1178082935,"This is such a fun fun game."
"14952",1178082935,"I is always a little hard to tell were exactly your going to land so maybe there could be some kid of update"
"14953",1178454060,"The game itself is fine but for the camera person/ filmed there is only one girl and multiple boys"
"14954",1178454060,"Not bad, difficult but it's still fun and addictive to play!"
"14955",1178454060,"I didn't like the way the character is to be navigated. It like the makers did it that way to increase the amount of adds they can make money off of. I uninstalled the game. Too difficult."
"14956",1178454068,"This game is fun for a while but like all games, gets boring to play. I like the game and I believe that anyone would like the game, I recommend this app 😊"
"14957",1178454068,"This game is great! It’s basically just a random game to play when your bored, or need to pass time! I love getting new bottles to flip and I’ve had this app for a VERY long time. Not on the same device but a few years actually. It’s extremely simple, not always EASY. But it’s simple! You have to hold down on the screen until it seems like it has enough power to jump/flip to the next object, and if you do it too hard it will fly to far or off the screen 😂 there’s a blue Diamond thing that you can collect on most of them. The more you get of those, the more you get to buy a new bottle! The gameplay is really fun! I don’t see anything particularly WRONG with it, but it seems like it just needs a bit more.. I can’t really think of anything right now, but it just feels kinda plain. That’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Thank you! I recommend this app to people who just like to chill and play something simple to pass time! Byeee! Sincerely, Happy User 😃"
"14958",1178454068,"I love it so much.thank for who ever put bottle flip.by Chloe Thx"
"14959",1178472225,"Don't allow access to contact. Otherwise the app will send out a text to every contact inviting them to the app. Total scam and should be taken off the App Store."
"14960",1178472225,"Grabs your contacts and forwards message to them saying you've ""invited them"" even if you didn't. Don't download. Shady methods."
"14961",1178472225,"This app sent a message to all of my contacts without my consent. I clicked cancel on sending app invites but it still sent. Really shattered my confidence with the whole ""anonymous"" function this is supposed to have."
"14962",1178822943,"Don’t waste your dollar. For your money you get the privilege of spending more money. This app is useless."
"14963",1178822943,"Should have read reviews first. Lame and waste of money!!!!!!!!!"
"14964",1178822943,"The app itself just gives you the ability to buy the emojis. Waste of money!"
"14965",1178880179,"This is the best puzzle game I’ve ever played. I remember seeing coryxkenshin playing this. The 1st Ao Oni"
"14966",1178880179,"Yes yes yes , this game is finally in the App Store 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻, I thought I will never see this game on phone specially iOS , I will never be disappointed of you guys (Apple) ( (App Store)😉😉😉😉😉!!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻yeeeessss!!!"
"14967",1178880179,"I have known about Ao Oni for a while and this game made me confused because first of all the story doesn’t make since like where does it tie into the story, they could have gave us more new characters to show what happened to Hiroshi after he escaped Ao Oni but no it’s just the same cast same monster and just new map also the controls are just bad like they could have a little controller in the corner and even that would fix it. And also Ao Oni 3 needs to be translated to English and this game needs to be on more devices so it can get more popular and more plays"
"14968",1178973979,"There is NO sound. If it’s not fixed fast I’m disputing the charge!"
"14969",1178973979,"The controls aren’t intuitive at all. The screen is angle in a weird way and only responds to repeated tapping on the left or right side of the screen. Problem is is that your character moves at an angle."
"14970",1178973979,"My daughter is 4. She wanted a fun PJ masks game to play. What she got was a pseudo game with quite literally the worst control scheme I have ever seen. Pass it up. Not worth 3 bucks."
"14971",1179267591,"I love this game"
"14972",1179267591,"When I first drive I glitches and sometimes kicks me off the game"
"14973",1179267591,"You don’t get a chance to see what you did wrong just like someone said in the rate crashes. Some of the other cars that are driving around don’t help one because Sumer bump in to you with their side view mirrors. So I think they should go because in driving practice in real life there are no cars driving around you.   BAM                      WHAT !!!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"14974",1179462965,"First off the game is awesome .but Can you add cop cars and General Lee cars. When is the next update going to be . Send the answer to me. And when is the next update or next version of farming usa"
"14975",1179462965,"I think the game is grate but I wish that you could make it were you can purchase buildings and fences also. It would also be neat to be able to detach duals and loader arms. Also why does hired workers stop, and everything unhook when you go out of the game. It would also be neat if more than two people could be in a multiplayer game. Also why do hired workers sometimes stop the tractor and then drive backwards in circles. It would also be nice to make the hired workers would drive in circles instead of back and forth so the ends aren’t so sloppy. In the end you made a great game but I would like to see some of these improvements."
"14976",1179462965,"I have played this game since right after they came out with the tracked big tractor but I have watched it grow it went form being boring at first to after getting the online add on to being so much fun i have done so much farmed and logged and many other things"
"14977",1179475725,"What happened to Candy Cat..?   (P.S) Musical chairs isn’t a game anymore. It’s lord of the chairs."
"14978",1179475725,"I bought this because reviews were 3.6 and And one person said her daughter loved it and the sound problem could be fixed I can’t even figure out how to play the games and I cannot fix the sound problem. I think there should be a way to get a refund if you purchase something and I’m not going to use it"
"14979",1179475725,"The app seems to be defective. Absolutely no sound. Will give new review if issue is resolved"
"14980",1179685798,"App is no good and the reviews are clearly all fake.   Busted English saying the same generic yay good comments.   Boo.  Veer and your parent company should be booted for unethical practices."
"14981",1179685798,"I love the platform but the videos freeze a lot. Needs some work as to the titles dont show or the preview"
"14982",1179685798,"This is basically just a collection of random video excerpts. And I use the word excerpts because the videos are not complete. Some stop right in the middle. Many are advertisements for movies. It’s OK if you want a sampling of virtual reality videos, but I found it very unsatisfying"
"14983",1179840697,"I love saying to people ""hey, you have a dollar on you? I want to show you something cool!""  I always get a smile out of my audience.  Wish this app had more features, however I do love it's simplicity."
"14984",1179840697,"Every time I open the app and wait for it to open after I click start the app crashes- too bad it looks like it would of been pretty cool"
"14985",1179840697,"Awesome but you should be able to use Mexican dollar bills or pesos or even coins and yuan it would be sick"
"14986",1180340451,"Good enough to play sometimes"
"14987",1180340451,"Good"
"14988",1180340451,"That monster so scaring"
"14989",1180467988,"This is fun and challenging even if it’s not Christmas."
"14990",1180467988,"Meh"
"14991",1180467988,"Totally addicted. Put on music and I’m content to go brain dead"
"14992",1180885427,"As I said above, please update for iPhone X :)"
"14993",1180885427,"This is great for vr cardboard and iPhone. It doesn’t have hardly any ads and maze is hard to solve so it keeps you searching and shooting zombies. I did find a treasure chest but couldn’t open it. Very fun for a newbie vr experience. Can be played sitting down even on rotating desk chair. 😂✨✨✨✨"
"14994",1180885427,"Why are there birds cawing in the middle of a dark cave? Along with crickets? They don’t belong there, and what’s up with the same guy screaming every 40 seconds it drives me nuts. Well I’m sorry but put more work into this please"
"14995",1181616006,"I was digging this - great graphics, fun characters, but it needs some more playtesting. I can reliably fall through the floor in a few places on level 1-6. It makes my 6s really hot too -- I wouldn't mind an option to turn down the graphics quality to be able to play longer."
"14996",1181616006,"What a great game, very enjoyable. Has good tricky puzzles. Waiting for sequel.......Manoj"
"14997",1181616006,"The ""puzzles"" are lame! They don't make sense? They make the game a freakin chore to play. Why do I have to smash a crate against a wall to get a security card to open a door. Let me smash the door to get through it!   That Grav-I-gun thing is not easy to use and sometimes the camera angles makes it hard to see. It was a frustrating experience for me! 2 starts for effort..."
"14998",1181904201,"Absolutely, horrible I get penalties for not even doing anything"
"14999",1181904201,"Still learning the controls, but like it so far!"
"15000",1181904201,"It’s fun and all that but the car doesn’t have that mouch of control but it cool"
"15001",1182331762,"Short but unique and fun, two endings, has a Save, plays well, no glitches.  Thank you!"

"15005",1182568288,"The look that the kids in my fam make when they see Santa is priceless I love this app!"
"15006",1182568288,"This is cool"

"15008",1183234072,"I've love the ctfxc I'm happy that they have this app I support them 100% all the way I watched them from maybe day 20 they helped me throw the hard times in my life they make me smile and laugh"
"15009",1183234072,"Love using them! Basically my new form of communication!"
"15010",1183260922,"Fairly challenging, well thought-out escape room. The clues don’t have to be found in order."
"15011",1183260922,"This is an amazing game in my opinion, and I can’t believe they have a whole bunch more!!! I love it !!!"
"15012",1183260922,"Enjoyed playing!😊😊😊😊😊"
"15013",1183548754,"Great"
"15014",1183548754,"Worth the time. Good puzzles."
"15015",1183548754,"Had to pay up front, ok. But then you had to pay extra for hints.  Had good reviews so, ok. But then the hints just directed you to a video that I could have found on YouTube. Deleted the game. Super lame."
"15016",1183986102,"Gbjbgcjnugrg"
"15017",1183986102,"I think in my opinion that you  shouldn’t have to watch ads every time you go to a new level and it said it was Santa hair Salon but really it’s all sorts of people it’s a great game for little girls and I guess if you want boys can also play it but don’t get me wrong I’m saying it’s a great game as well but there could be a few improvements here and there"
"15018",1183986102,"This game has no adds only some you don’t have to buy anythng it’s awesome"
"15019",1184800011,"ちょっと考えさせられるところもあったけど、面白かった。"
"15020",1184800011,"Good fun, not too long to solve. Some of the puzzle might be easier if you do not understand Japanese at all."
"15021",1184800011,"Still can't finish the last puzzle with the 3 and colors. There is not a reference that I can find."
"15022",1185580782,"Okie so I've been playing this game for a while now and I was thinking what would be fun to add is dogs and cats you can tame and dolphins 🙂"
"15023",1185580782,"Please add things like pet dogs and cats.More food types.more animals such as chickens and goats.And maybe add seasonal weather."
"15024",1185580782,"I love griffin! Will ya make a new griffin egg or depend on mods maybe! Will ya make a different a fancy saddle, crown, and king clothes, I always want to ride them!   I love Christmas decorations and clothes for reindeer!

"15025",1186126548,"I read some of the negative reviews after I downloaded this game and immediately noticed that it was kind of blurry so I deleted the game from my iphone. But after couple of days I downloaded it again on my iphone, I realized it was not blurry at all, but rather part of the game’s creative design of xmas lights and fog and I have gotten used to it. I love this game. It is fun and easy. I finished it in less than 45 minutes. Goro Sato you’re the best. 🤗 Looking forward to your next game. ❤️"
"15026",1186126548,"I enjoy all of Goro Sato’s games although they are all short and fairly easy. The one thing I did not like here was the blurry effect probably to give it a Christmas lighting feeling. That didn’t work for me."
"15027",1186126548,"I liked the theme and puzzles in the game. The hints section is also appreciated but the quality of the graphics is very poor."
"15028",1186384912,"It’s good, but whenever I play it, it lags off after one match that I played and I here myself playing but I don’t see anything else other than the garage when I joined in. Please fix that. Other than that, it’s a really good game!"
"15029",1186384912,"Great game! Love it!  Best VR game on IOS.  It keeps freezing though!  If it didn’t, I would give 5 stars.  Please fix"
"15030",1186384912,"Git a headset for me birthday and ive been using it ever sience"
"15031",1187279979,"OK, listen here. I made a pack for the spooky mansion. What a waste of time LOL. And then I try to create an animal and then I go to click the plus button and nothing works. This is stupid! So I clicked another one, doesn’t work. Another, doesn’t work. Another, doesn’t work. Please try to fix this before I never get this again. Bye."
"15032",1187279979,"Add all of the mobs please. I love if u could also allow us to make changes to the strength of mobs and make them hostile even if there a pig. And allow them to poison and give wither sickness. Last, I can even play the game so fix that. Thx for reading this"
"15033",1187279979,"I’ve been using this developers’ apps for years and am honestly disappointed with how awful the UI and tools work. It pains me to see what you’ve made."
"15034",1187282363,"We need new questions"
"15035",1187282363,"I love this game but we need more Questions please!!! Or replay value is low. Otherwise worth the buy :)"
"15036",1187282363,"Drinking suggests why I was so frivolous to buy it."
"15037",1187617475,"There was a game in 2011 called Tetra3D that I used to play all the time. It was the same as Tetris, wherein you could move the block anywhere on the board by turning the board one turn (as you can with this game) but you could also move the placement of the block (in Kubik, if a block is going to land in the middle, no matter how you rotate it, it will land on the middle of whatever side it ends up on). Further in Tetra3D you could rotate the block along the x, y, and z axes.   The game stopped working a long time ago and hasn’t been updated in years, in fact I can no longer find it in the App Store. Kubik is the closest game I have found to my former favorite game, but as it is now missing the ability to move the blocks as freely as I expect has made the game frustrating and not fun.   If possible I would love more ability to rotate and flip blocks, and to move the location of the falling blocks rather than just being able to rotate the base that they are falling onto.   Thanks!"

"15039",1187617475,"Has nice visuals and color schemes, has a great game concept. I like the level of difficulty, as it is both do-able and challenging.   It is hard to navigate or choose the planets, though,it would be easier to be able to see them all and select one, instead of having to scroll through them all.   Also, creating an option to turn off/on the music and sound separately, that’d be nice. Missions/achievements, maybe? Some improvements can be made. But overall, nice game to play."
